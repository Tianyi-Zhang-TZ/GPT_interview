I like to see people be successful in their jobs and what they're doing. And so I'm very willing to help them achieve and do what it takes to be successful as far as weaknesses. I would say that I'm not much of a conflict. Foreign Tatian person. If there's a problem with the project or something, I tend to probably not be as direct as I should be like. Beating around the bush too much or when I should be saying, hey, this is a problem in. Here's what we need to do, I don't like to tell people what to do and wanting them to come to the conclusion of what they should do on their own. Is he is does not always work as a solution. So I have a problem with being direct with people, that's my weakness."

I think I think that's bad friendly. I think they would say I'm friendly person and I always get along with everyone."

Some of those decisions were a negative amount of money. For example, one time I left a job. I didn't like to take a lower paying job because I felt that the opportunity in that job was worth the lower amount of money. And it did work out eventually I did Increase my pay even higher than before but it did take about three years. So overall I think it was a good decision and I did make some really good professional contacts from that. So I do take risks like that. Where it could end up as a negative overall, but but this one lucky for me was the positive."

The team had worked in person together prior to covid, so they had seen each other every day. They had built these relationships and then I came in and I didn't know anybody, there was hardly any opportunities to interact in person. And so, when I came in, I was just kind of, like, greasing everybody up. Like, hey, I know, you're so busy, but can you help me with something or can you look at this, like just just acknowledging that they were busy and that they would be doing me a great favor by helping me with learning new things, or Or. And occasionally, I try to make it personal and talk to them about their kids or their white fur, whatever their interests are. Just so we could kind of form that interpersonal relationship."

Normally it's a situation where I asked someone to do something or take care of something and they don't do it or I remind them and they still don't do it. Which is so irritating to me because I feel like I'm a person who if you ask me to do something. I'm going to do it and I'll take care of it and you don't have to ask me twice. So for me to have to ask someone multiple times to do their job is super stressful for me but I try to keep it positive like hey as soon as you do this I can stop bugging you about this and we can in my head I'm thinking we can all move on with our lives and hopefully I don't have to talk to you about the situation again, but of course always just try to keep it positive like hey if You do this for me, we can close this project and we can be done and try to spin it in a way that shows the benefit to them."

I think that the greatest reason that that occurs is because when I get unhappy especially in a work situation. If I'm bored, I some super unorganized just because I don't see a benefit and being organized if I'm bored. I'm like this won't gain me anything. Thing. But if I'm super busy then I'm like, I got to have everything exactly where I need it and I know where it is so I can access it easily and So yeah, it would say that's the primary reason that I become disorganized as boredom being busy, really, keeps me on my toes and requires a lot of organization when I'm just overloaded with things to do."

I am generally very truthful and have a lot of integrity and tries to be authentic while keeping in line with typical normal same values. I also think my humor is among my greatest drink. Some of my weaknesses would be, I can at times be a bit too kind and forgiving causing others to try to take advantage of me, which then leads to my next weakness, which is my strange way of expressing myself, when I'm frustrated, which usually is a little bit. Well, it's also honest and authentic. So, whatever. I'm feeling at the time, I may say it and that could be a strength and a weakness. So, yeah, it's just it's hard for me to deal with people sometimes when like customers I could deal with angry customers, but sometimes when you see somebody every single day and they are Not nice to you. And it's what do they call it? Like systematically every day. They have something to say or something. That they're trying to cause problems about is, that's, that's the hardest part for me. Is dealing with people like that so, you know, working on it. But that, that would be about all Thank you."

Also, sometimes a little strange not necessarily in a bad way but I'm creative type. So sometimes my thoughts and feelings come out in the things that I do and make and say, writing photography, things like that, I tend to be a little bit out there compared to most people, so I would say they would describe me as a little eccentric but funny with a good heart. Hopefully loud sometimes and sometimes very quiet, but usually kind of louder and some hyper. Lots of people would say high energy, I'm a high-energy type of person. I like to drink coffee that fuels the fire of my creative brain so I can come up with a lot of ideas in a short time if needed. And sometimes those ideas involve road trips, And shopping but I'm you know just really an average kind of person. So nothing really crazy other than my own little adventures that I get into that usually don't actually involve road trips but they do involve shopping and so yeah, I like to enjoy life. I like my, that's how I believe my best friend would describe me. Is someone who likes to enjoy life? Have fun live the best life that I can be kind to others. Try to stay out of trouble so I'm not a troublemaker. My Doom of us to see how the trouble and someone who maybe struggles to fit in sometimes. But but once I find a place I fit in, then I stay I don't like to keep looking and searching for places. Thanks."

I could make well, that happens a lot. I mean, not the money so much, but the status I have to make a lot of decisions that affect my status and especially, because I'm are an honest person. People don't always want to hear the truth. So usually it doesn't affect my much money, I make, but it does affect my so-called status because I don't really have super high status as it is. So I don't really have that much to fall there. So you know, it's like one little thing and you are on another lower level, you know, or you could go up a level or down two levels are up to but not usually more than that. So, a situation. Really, it's just like basic. The need to tell somebody like, you're not doing things right. And you tell them that and they get mad and upset and so they, you know, because it could be because I'm around a lot of people that maybe don't have the level of emotional maturity that they should have in the place that they're in. So that's part of it. Yeah. So it's like basically situation. We are trying to tell someone, look, this isn't right what you're doing and you have to stop. I've been told by multiple people. You have to stop and you tell them in the nicest way possible and they shoot the messenger and to say there, you get back at you, which could affect status and money sometimes. So, it could be like a landmine out there, and I haven't had a ton of experience in That area, as far as how, you know, because I am not a manager like, you know, so it's like how do you tell people these things? Because if I wear manager, they probably would respond very differently. Even though I said it the exact same way, but because they view themselves in their own head as being high status, And I'm from this low status, then they say, you know, don't like it anyways and they let everyone know."

I went I got a space like a place where I put my art and I put my like retail product type things, sort of a side job. And so there's a new seating people. So, how do I usually behave when I enter a new team? Well, usually, I'm polite. I do try to be polite whether they're new or not new. So, but, of course, it's a new situation. So I typically try to be really polite and understand where they're coming from, and how they are. Because, so many people can behave in. So So many different ways, where one thing you say, could be taken as funny or nice, one place, and then it can be taken as mean and offensive somewhere else. So I try to be aware of that. And do of us again about just being polite and nice but real not fake. I don't try to put on some kind of a show but I do try to be my best of hit that way. Try to be my best self but put a good foot forward there so they don't think I'm just a horrible person and why do I think that is a little because I like Like to make other people feel accepted and cared for whether I just met them, are no known for the most of my life. I like people to feel comfortable and happy to be around me, not scared, or worried that I'm going to, you know, be mean, or hateful to them, or judge them where I come from. It's called Roll out of his cultural people. Here are very different in personality and there's a lot of people that are very rough and dangerous so they're kind of always little bit shell-shocked. Even if you're walking into a board room meeting they're going to be sort of shell-shocked and it may behave see you know depending on where you're at or what's going on they could be overly aggressive. Overly aggressive or under aggressive. It's just all kinds of things."

It usually depends on how much they've annoyed me. If it's a mild annoyance and they didn't really intentionally do it, I'll just move on. I mean, there's annoyances all day long in life, so if it's just smiled, you know, maybe I'm just grouchier. I do my tolerance level, I usually just Just move on and forget about it. If it's something really really bad and they keep doing it. Well either tell him to stop or I'll just remove myself from the situation. Why do I think that is? Why I think it's because I can get over stimulated easy and I'm aware of that. So I try to look at it as is this something that is Annoying me because it's annoying really bad or because I just can't handle it right now. Or is this something that is so annoying? That something needs to be done about it because it's wrong. Like somebody just popping their gum, Over and over. And, you know, that's their thing. Then I move away. If it's something, like they're going to annoy me with their rude, comments on a daily basis and their epic, rude. I might tell them. Because that's me."

We're getting start and stop so we times because I kept messing this thing up, I don't know what all you've got or how many minutes I'm at now? Basically this is a new question you got bro. Oh wow okay sorry for this this I would call this a glitch on my part medical it's okay think of situations when your worker works because we're not very organized. That is not very typical of me. I like it organized and I do projects and crafts all the time and I'll make a huge mess. Glue and paper and scissors and strings in things, you can't even identify but when that is over, so is the mess. So I keep my workspace organized because otherwise I can't find things I like to have in holders for my pins but papers can get a bit out of control because they don't have the proper Please like to put these things. There's just no, there's too many papers and not enough space. So I just kind of stack them up in little. Like this goes with this and this goes that but they're not in specific files or drawers. They're just stacked on my desk. That can sometimes get a little messy, but I wouldn't wish I had a better system. Then I wouldn't be that way because I don't like Like messes. So and why do I think it's typical me to not be messy and to stay organized for the most part is because otherwise I cannot find what I'm looking for. I get frustrated when I can't find what I'm looking for. So I don't and I don't like things dirty or scattered like some people put trash balls and wrappers, and candy, and red bulls that are half drank and they just leave them. You just leave him there like and go home, like it was nothing. Waiting for their mama to come. Pick him up, clean up after them, but my mom wouldn't clean up after me. Even she could. So that's maybe why."

I really focus on a task until it's completed. I don't want to finish like prematurely I want to make sure something is followed through till the end and at the same time against a weakness could be that the idea of that persistence II want something to happen. So I Might be a little frustrated. If say I'm not able to have changes happen to certain material that I like so much. So you know, I can be focused on that instead of may be focused on other areas that might help business."
5513256cfdf99b1607b1f47b_q2_c1_1671686059_750dbef7-0038-4255-ac91-0ec11e31ecd7,"All right. How would my best friend? Describe me. Well generally, I'm someone who's easy to talk to. I have some great listening skills. I would say, my shirt, like meeting a variety of people so it, you know, they'd say I'm the open, you know, I'm definitely a risk taker. Someone who's willing to meet new people working in situations, take risks, open to new experiences and challenges. I'm somebody who have courses intelligent able to solve problems plan projects and they're just ensure that everyone's kind of on the same pace and able to get get projects done and and take care of stuff in a good manner."

Let's definitely something that I've had experience with in the past. Currently, I have a kind of side job I do and I'm always, it's always up to me. Basically, how much money I make and that situation is, I'm in sales position and well. How do I behave in situations while I make sure that I explain beyond what my role is. What I can do to solve the customers problems, what I can do as far as what I have here, how the process works and how I can get them into a situation that works for them. And again, obviously works for me as well so I can get paid. So throughout the process, I'm helpful understanding. I listen to them, I do kind of guide them in a certain direction and that's just because obviously, that's why I need you to get paid. Additionally I guess other situations that could affect my status. Yeah it's just you know for me training education perspective. Well the number of Publications in such that I can get out. It's a little hard to do right now in my current situation but that's how it is because that's the requirements for certain positions. Say if I want to apply to work in a different area they may care. What am I doing? What's my output like? And that's kind of going to be is to then evaluate me."
5513256cfdf99b1607b1f47b_q4_c1_1671686261_750dbef7-0038-4255-ac91-0ec11e31ecd7,"All right, so think of situations when I join a new team of people, how do I usually behave when I enter a new team? Well, the first thing I want to do is I want to get familiar with. What we need to do is to team. What, what challenges do, we have whatever you're doing, one of our goals and then I kind of want to see, you know, what's the makeup like, what everyone specialty. What are we like what we like to do for fun? How do we evaluate ourselves how we function together? And what things can we do? Do you know together that we might need to improve on? What, what do we do? Well, it works great and that's just because that's just kind of natural to me. So I want to just, you know, get to know people I'm around. And of course, I'm also focused on problem solving and I just want to make sure I understand where we are, and where we can go. That's just how I look at work."
5513256cfdf99b1607b1f47b_q5_c1_1671686341_750dbef7-0038-4255-ac91-0ec11e31ecd7,"Hi is the thinking of the time when someone annoyed me, I usually react in situations. And why do I think that is? Well, I tend to be someone who is not usually annoyed. You know, I may have been in the past but I've taken on a more relaxed personality and I just try not to let stuff bother me so much. So I guess there are still some situations, you'll maybe it's something as basically someone just kind of Behaving on professionally a situation. Maybe not having a time management skills and they just had to show up whenever they want to and maybe leave whenever they want to. So they don't finish serving. The customers are working with. See, I have feel frustrated because I feel like Nord. I feel like there's there's why am I here? Why am I doing what I'm doing? And again, that's just because I feel like I should be respected and valued in the situation, I feel like there should be some sort of universal respect. We all have for each other. Because we're all professionals."

This is not something that's very typical of me. I usually tend to be fairly organized in my workspace - well, I could think of as my digital workspace. So my desktop, it is fairly scattered. In some areas. I have multiple monitors so I attend that has to file from the desktop that I use. Some of them are in folders, which make logical sense. But sometimes I have icons that I have to have four different various functions. I do Do and then maybe I have some various channels that end up there may be some stuff from work out temporarily and instead of you know, allocate to certain areas I just kind of leave it where it is. Yeah. It's just you know because maybe I'm just busy with something and I maybe just don't think about organizing that really too much of a digital organizer. But certainly, I have a clean desk."

So basically, it was still, I was still learning but also learning a new skill. So I tended to be a little Scattered at those points. And typically, I would succeed and just work through it and generally I am really good at what I do.

Who actually knows what they're talking about. Who doesn't, who's pretending who's not was good at what they do, things like that.

There's a lot of people like that in sales and I think that is they're trying to overcompensate from their failings or make people believe they're good. So they're not observed on the job. So typically, I I'm annoyed by those type of people."

Would be when there's a deadline student to meet, paperwork could be on the desk and then the work might not be organized, because I'm scrambling to get everything done at that last minute, especially if a new task was put upon me.

I always am asking questions and I always want to double check and make sure that we're doing the right things for the business. I think those traits in general come through and all of my actions and how I approach things, how I interact With customers and I also definitely try to make sure that I bring my best to each customer interaction. I want to make sure that the customer is satisfied. Many years ago, I worked in fast food. And while that's certainly not the most glamorous job I understand. And I think that's where I learned the importance of make the customer satisfied, give them an experience where they leave pleased and happy. And I've carried that through to my entire Career with regard to my general weaknesses. They think. I probably sometimes maybe tend to over communicate, I just in general probably as I described earlier as being somebody who's very thorough. I sometimes tend to communicate in ways that I think maybe You know, may not necessarily benefit my co-workers and teammates. So that's something I've been actively working on. I've been trying to make sure that I am much more succinct and how I interact with them and just try to be more direct and to the point"

And even if we're not necessarily having our best day physically, we we always find a way to make it to the to the end of the the route that we've committed to run to and then as I said I think my best friend would also describe me as being very playful. And, and looking for humor and just the day-to-day things in life. So a lot when we're out running, a lot of times, I'll see very humorous things that I point out to all more will be talking about sports and we'll talk about something humorous that happened in a sporting event.

I've had to make professional decisions that definitely could or have affected my status and potential earning income.

And then even within my job on a day-to-day basis, I've had to make decisions. With regard to whether we move forward with new products, whether we move new products into the next phase of their life cycle development. And every one of those decisions could definitely impact my status if the decision turns out bad, or if the products not ready, or if some of my stakeholders, don't agree, then that definitely impacts my status. Definitely does. Not make me look good necessarily with those individuals and then obviously it has a domino effect on my career. So I potentially might not be considered for an annual bonus. I might find my performance rating goes down and as a result, I would also get less compensation. So probably on a monthly basis. I get involved in professional.

Although, at the same time, I definitely don't want to be perceived as as being quiet or shy and in that regard as well. So in those new team environment side, Definitely try to really try and understand what's my role over the next couple months while I'm a new member of the team and where do I fit in? What's my, where am I kind of in the hierarchy of the other members on the team and where can I best contribute? But at the same point, not antagonize or or get off on the wrong foot with the other members of my team. And I also try to ask a lot of questions, just in general, I'm very inquisitive, I think, the way I learn is by asking questions in a sort of back-and-forth manner with other individuals. And so, when I enter the new team, I like to find those opportunities to ask questions to have back and forth, dialogue, maybe not within the context of the larger team. Because I know not everybody likes to Listen in and that type of environment. But I will definitely find Opportunities where maybe I can pull somebody to the side, maybe go out and have lunch with somebody and be able to ask a lot more detailed questions to better, understand the project and to understand the team and just to make myself more experienced. Because eventually as other people leave the team, I will find myself in a position where I will, then be one of the more audience members of the team and I want to be prepared at that point."

It's usually individuals that are intentionally trying to get involved in responsibilities that are outside their scope. A lot of times I'll describe it is staying within one's Lane as if you're like a you're you're swimming and Competition and you are expected to stay within your lane and I'll find sometimes, you know, people violate that, they'll step into areas that are definitely well outside their scope. And and as, and as a result that will will tend to be annoying, because we're already busy enough as it is at work, we have a lot of responsibilities on the plate. We have to keep things moving forward. And just like any member of the team, we want to make sure everybody's playing the right position and just like with the sports team, if somebody is playing out of position, you know, as an example, if the if the the quarterback is playing on the offensive line, then you're having to impacts on the team. One is the quarterback isn't necessarily utilizing their skill and likewise the the quarterback is probably not being very effective on the offensive line so I like to get in in situations where everybody's playing the right roles and that's I think the best way to avoid creating an annoyance within the team"

I tend to find that my a lot of items have piled up on my desk and I find that even before I can really begin on trying to work the income tax return itself. If I find that one of the things I have to do is just take several hours and organize myself kind of go through, get things organized. Make sure that all the all the paper gets filed into its proper folder. Make sure that all the items that I don't need are thrown away or recycled and I think by going through that process I tend to kind of get very organized at that point. I sort of know where everything is and And then at that point I can begin getting very focused on the activity at hand. So I mean I would say that that situation with income tax is probably similar whenever I have any sort of a big project of having to go through numbers or go through multiple documents and trying to organize and put things together. And I would say that my typical response is to just kind of take Take those first couple hours, get myself organized, disposed of all the, the non necessary items and then that tends to get my mind very focused and ready on the task at hand."

Like I'm often one of the few employees to stay behind, you know when it that's required of management required by management of me. And I often find myself like in the office, doing more speaking to my manager, making sure that for example tax returns are being filed, legitimately that the names and addresses are correct and just highlighting things that maybe aren't problems at the moment, but could be problems in the future. I guess you could say. That is also a great weakness of mine that I could. In some sense do too much, make too much work or potentially cause something to be raised as an issue that isn't actually an issue but it's just something that I don't know that we have or that I'm not aware of our procedures for handling. So I guess that I am a little bit seles. But you have to admire my heart."

Maybe a week ago, mostly just over the last day. He say that I'm very self-possessed and very stubborn. Not necessarily that I'm headed out that I'm delicious or that. I have a bad intent in terms of like the work that we do together but that I run off the world with like my own idea of what I think is necessarily like good for the art that I do. And that this idea doesn't necessarily connect with the art, people want to see. Though he did Definitely describe me as diligent. He always says, like you definitely improving very quickly maybe too much, maybe you could maybe take a break. My kind of thing.

You could say honest but mainly just self sparing choices that I could make. For example, in my work is a tax accountant. Occasionally, I'll get clients that they seem to really really really want someone who can give off the most professional in the most. Delicate demeanor in terms of tax code that they could want someone that they can sort of just say an acronym. That's at some point mentioned in the tax code, an acronym that stands for a concept. that's I don't know, maybe in one page of the tax code, some in that they want someone that could essentially just fire back with them with, considering REI t-- what you're going to want to do is not necessarily deduct, for instance, the entire value of everything that you've bought for your business, but you're going to want to Make sure to account for deprecation so on and so forth. What I typically do is just transfer those clients out towards our most professional and are obviously, or most experienced tax professionals rather than me. I just rather not attempt to attack attempt. To give off the to give off a false impression of how much expertise I have. Just for the sake of having another client and making more money rather than be with someone who may be most comfortable with discussing peculiarities of their taxes."

The reason that were there specifically is to work together, And that, you know, they don't need necessarily new friends in their life. They need someone whom they can work with well. So, the thing that I tend to do is I keep my conversations pertinent to like, what I'm working on or what they're working on, I greet them. Still ask them how they're doing if there's anything I can do to help. But the main trick or the main thing that I do, when I'm meeting a new group of co-workers is that like I buy them like a box of donuts or something, just like a small little chokey that they can have. That isn't necessarily like the biggest thing in the world, like, it's not like, I'm trying to be memorable over me, just buying them box of donuts. It's just that, you know, They might like something nice to eat while they're doing work. Otherwise like, I make sure the coffee pot is full. And I just stay under their Lane. Why I do that is well just it's just functional respect. I know that they don't want to necessarily socialize me to grieve with me. You were not there to like make new friends. What? Kind of just there to do or thing? So we can go home and socialize with the people we choose to be with"

But more that they have a need that they're pretty sure that you can't fulfill And the way that I normally handled that is I just go to someone else. I mean, I was never particularly liked in depth with the tax code, I hadn't worked with taxes for that long, but when I do, for example, get a call where client is just going to hittin acronym in the middle of the call and acronym for something that is very marginal. in terms of the, in terms of the tax code, but specifically for me, marginal, in terms of me, being aware of what that acronym is, and being able to just go, okay, REI t-- Revenue investment, no Revenue, e investment something, I'm pretty sure that's like a type of financial instrument or tax vehicle. I don't know, at the moment, I don't work there anymore, but the point is I see the broader point of what they're trying to indicate being that you don't know the beauty, how to handle my tax situation. And I just go For example, hey can I transfer you out to another one of our more experienced tax professionals? So I wasn't able to help you with your specific needs but I would like you to be able to be the someone who can and who you're comfortable working with. And again, I just think that's a function of me being relatively respectful towards other people's needs. I don't take things personally."

It's not necessarily that I've organized every workspace. I've been in I mean I do some of those clerical functions of like a job. But I haven't often been in, non organized work spaces, and they've generally stayed organized for as long as I've been there. It's not like I do a whole bunch of cleaning in. It's not like I make or make organizing things. A focus of the work that I do for people. But I'm very capable of respecting the organization that exists at my workspace and working with. Why do I think that's typical of me? To be honest, I'm just aware of the fact that like, my needs don't in any way supersede. The needs of other people that I'm working with, like, relatively small, in terms of skill, relatively low to the ground. I understand that other people that I work with are probably a bit more capable of what they're doing than I am. And I just try to stay out of their way to make sure that the things that they need to do their jobs. Or setup. I have occasionally been the one to organize things or been the one to set like an organization schema down, but it's more in terms of like data storage. Like in terms of making sure that files have a specific naming scheme in the full, I'm sorry files. And the folders for those files are in like, obviously, like demarcated places and it's relatively easy to find them. Should anyone leave them? Again, that's a function of respect."

So what I did was I worked for temp, companies', and with that, I was able to go in and out of businesses, in a lot of different fields in order to gain experience in a lot of different places and that did absolutely affect my status and how much money I was able.

You're getting paid. You put your best effort forward. I just don't, it's any situation, especially in the workforce. Not so much outside of work. I just let that roll off my back, that's not affecting me. But in a workplace I'm working with you. You not you acting that way is affecting me. I am a good worker. I'm a hard worker. I'm doing what I'm supposed to. I'm trying to move forward with the company. Make it work, make it be profitable, make it be prosperous. And if you can't do that too, it's not rocket science, it's not that hard. Do your job and if you're not doing that then I can be very annoying very annoyed and it's probably it's probably not good because I shouldn't let other people affect me but that's absolutely. So I've been annoyed I've been where I was like a trainer and I've had people go in and just change the schedule. I just made because that's what they wanted to do. Talk about being annoyed. Wade, who do you think you are and and then I've had to do the schedule because we hand wrote it and then I had to do it in Sharpie so that you could tell if somebody messed with it right off the bat that was probably one of the most annoying things as far as in a workplace where I was actually in charge of somebody else constantly being late for no reason. There are good reasons, but then there are just because you are not responsible."

It's because I've got way too much going on at one time in a multitasking and puts probably out of a need. And I've let it just get out of hand. That's not exactly. Well, I guess that's kind of typical what, why do I think that is? It's because I can, I'm multitasking too much. I've taken on too much at one time because I'm trying to get it all done, when I need to pull it back in a little bit, and I know that if I kept it organized, along the way, I would probably be a whole lot more. Efficient, my Typically I'm not keeping my worker workspace unorganized myself but I've been in situations where my Worker Works based was not very organized based on just the nature of where I was working and how that was being run, that would totally be because of the management. Or how management was told to do it by corporate it. I worked in places Where the flow didn't work. There was no Rhyme or Reason. I was working one time in a printing place where they printed magazines and so there was a flow of that process and like one end of. It had no idea. They never knew where in the process, any of the work was there was no flow to. It was just chaotic, there wasn't exactly my workspace, but I had to work with all of that as a whole, and I had to go in and streamline it And I don't exactly know why that was but I just don't think they had effective leaders that was able to sit come in and say, wait a minute, this is not working. So I had to fix that."

I'm very intuitive into problem-solving. I am also able to look at different tasks and streamline them in a manner that is more productive to get the job done. And generally, I am able to look at tasks Solutions, task problems and come up with Solutions. I would say that my biggest weakness as an employee would be my lack of desire to delegate pass. I have a hard time sort of giving away something and trusting that it's going to get done. But I've overcome that in the sense of looking at the task or the thing that I'm giving away and sort of mapping out a outcome that I'm looking to get from it. And then, Visiting later when it's already done kind of giving it a scan of look over to make sure that the outcome is Nick in the realm of what I was looking for in the first place. So I would say, typically my strength would be the ability to think outside the box come up with Solutions and being the weakness of delegating out. Sort of, I don't know if it's a lie."

I would say caring due to being that I look at other people's feelings. I have sort of a high empathy value for others and I kind of take into consideration my actions on how it's going to affect other. So I think that's one big caring aspect. The creative aspect is I love the Arts not photography painting. And typically with that taking that artistic point of view, sort of helps me to tap into that creative thinking outside the box mentality."

How do I usually behave in such situations with that? I like to think of the pros and cons of the situation or think of pros and cons of the decision of the situation? How is that going to affect me and my family and those around me? And also, I sort of way around my why, where do I want to be a year from now, two years from now, is sort of the reason why I think that is the way that I look at it if I know the why I know the outcome that I'm looking to Achieve. I kind of look at if I made a decision, this would be the most likely outcome, or if I made be decision. This would be the most likely outcome. How much money I make. I usually weigh that with what other benefits, what? I obtained if I went a certain direction, so money isn't everything. Happiness is a big part and status For the most part, doesn't mean too much to me."

I'd like to introduce myself and give them a little bit of background between personal and business characteristics that I have. And I also inquire about theirs. I like to see That. We're going to mesh together. Well as the team, I think that's the biggest reasoning behind why I do what I do and I enter into a new team is that I like to be able to connect with people both on a personal and business level. So that when problems arise or tasks need to be done, Done. You know what personal characteristics, each individual team member has and whether or not certain people are going to be good at certain tasks, and other people are going to be good at other tests. So, due to knowing that different people have different strengths is sort of why I like to get to know people on a personal level. Are they organized or they an Thinkers opposed to an emotional thinker. So different personality characteristics of the team are good to know when you're working together with them."

I ran my own real estate, photography business and run time. And somebody was annoying me. I was basically the expectations, the order was placed the they constantly pushed the envelope of Wendy expectations were or what the expectations were, when we clearly defined what they were in the beginning. How I usually react to that sit type of situation as I restate that hey, you know, we agreed upon these time frames the specs and we're on target to reach those and sort of say that. Well the reason that I do that is so that they'll sort of get the hint that then pushing the envelope on that wanting a done earlier, wanting it done. Current way is really just going to delay the process as a whole, and then they're not going to be happy with that. So that's sort of why I approach it that way."

And that's typically due to having multiple tasks to do at the same time and having multiple tasks open. So you're going to have information out to perform each task. And it's not too typical and mainly due to. I use a lot of spreadsheets to track different activities different deadlines different projects. So my overall work space isn't too disorganized, but there are times when you do, when I do have a lot of stuff going on at the same time that even those spreadsheets can become a little, not organized. and typically what in general, what I do with that is Take a moment to reorganize reprioritize and get things back on track, because I'm well aware that having a disorganized workspace, usually leads to disorganized work. So, I like to have my workspace, pretty neat, because I know that my environment is sort of a reflection into my collection."

I always show up on time and I'm very reliable. I've almost never been late to work ever and I have a great ability to lead a team. On the other hand, my weaknesses are probably that I work a little too hard sometimes and that I will sometimes volunteer for extra shifts when other people aren't able to take those as a way to help the team out. But it definitely makes it more difficult for me, balancing work and life balance."

So even if it would necessarily give me more money, I try to make decisions based on what's best for my actual clients. Because if you treat your clients right, they'll definitely keep coming back and make sure they continue supporting the business or as we just try to take money from them. Essentially they'll be a lot less likely to continue using for This which I think is just a bad business model and ethics model in general. I think it's just because I have been there before as a client and I understand how people think and act and what's generally best for them."

I am a fairly quiet person but once I get to know people I definitely open up a lot more. I tend to be a lot less of a leader early on but over the course of a couple weeks as I start to get to know people, I feel more comfortable making those executive decisions and telling them what to do as a leadership role. And I think I do that just because I tend to not be a very extroverted person. I'm more of an introvert and it takes me some time to be super confident with telling my team what to do until I get to know how the procedures are."

Sometimes I'll make a subtle comment, asking them to stop doing whatever is annoying me. But I don't ever react out loud just because it's not usually something they're doing on purpose. It's usually a lack of training or something along those lines. It's a lot of the times, I'll just reach out to their direct supervisor and see about getting them properly trained. You're sending a group email to everyone other than single an individual person. Because I think it's better for the team environment. So only to talk with everyone instead of just one person in particular."

I organized everything I want in my area, my work spot varies day to day so I'll put on my waterball my clipboard papers and note-taking devices. I'll organize my computer tabs as I see that. So putting it on like Google drive or company software's and just putting everything in order. That makes the most sense for my workflow generally maintained at that way. Sometimes people. Will take over my spot during the day and have to switch around, which makes it a little less organized because I have to do that multiple times across the day. But for the most part I'm very organized. And it's just because my personality is always been that way, I'm always the type of person to keep things together and make sure that I'm doing the right thing to keep my workplace work on schedule."

As a greatest strength, I really like to do research and plan and find the answer to any problem that I may have, I think, you know, complicated problems. Can take a lot of time and energy. To solve and I'm always ready to solve something complicated and to get to the bottom of anything that, you know, other people may have trouble with. As far as a weakness. Sometimes I feel like when there are certain problems that are extremely hard, I don't want to give up on them. I want to focus on the too hard rather than moving on to something that could clear my head. I always like to make sure that I solve problems."

It would describe me as someone who's fun to be around someone who's funny, someone, who is able to, you know, make a lot of jokes and someone who's just intelligent and unique. I think they would definitely say that there aren't many people like me and that, you know, a conversation with me is is a unique thing because of my unique perspective."

So I have been in situations where I was at a job and another opportunity came up that would pay me more money and I would have the opportunity to leave my current job to go to another job. That offers a better opportunity and usually when that happens I do try to Make sure that, you know, I try to get the best opportunity for myself even though I am. I do believe in helping out the team. I also believe in the fact that if I work hard, I should be rewarded hard. I should be rewarded for work, so if there are employers that want to offer me, an opportunity to be fully compensated for all of the work I do. I will choose that opportunity. And that's because I just believe, and if I work hard, I should be paid accordingly."

I really when I go to a new position, I like to get to know everyone who I'm going to be working with get to know their personality, you know what they do in their spare time, what they do for fun, how they work, you know, what are their pet peeves? What are the things that they like in a teammate? And I try to get an understanding of how I'm I, I myself, I'm going to fit in In with this new team. I always have the goal in mind of becoming.

I have worked at a bank and had to, you know, ask people to sign up for different kinds of accounts that they didn't know about. A lot of people are angry when you bring this type of stuff up, they just want to do their Action to get out. But I have to remember to put myself in their shoes and understand what they're what they want, overall from their perspective. And I try to offer them something that I know would make their day better or their life better. Just try to offer them, something that's going to improve their lives. Make them better than when they first walked in that way, if I'm improving their life, you know. They're seeing me as an asset rather than someone who's just trying to sell something."

I wasn't a particular situation where my boss was fired and until a new boss, had been replaced was replaced. The old boss, we were all kind of just working and doing the best we can. There was no one officially in charge. So we kind of had to To just do what we can to meet meet our goals and to help each other out. This was not typical. Normally we have someone that is in charge this time we didn't and that's because normally I work in places where there are lots of there, lots of managers and bosses around but you know we stuck together we planned out how we were going to work and Achieve our goals and we were able to achieve them."

But we may not necessarily have all of the tools or materials or just aren't able to accomplish it by the book and the way things are meant to go on the other hand. I think sometimes when there is an established procedure that we're able to follow and there's no reason to immediately question it. I don't look beyond that sometimes and I could I would benefit from looking at times when we have an established procedure but that procedure may not be the most efficient or the most effective and coming up with the new solution is necessary. But I don't think to come up with a solution or look for a new solution because The existing solution works if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And I have nothing pushing me or no, emergent need to change the solution."

I try to treat everyone equally treat people. The way I want to be treated, I tried to treat people with respect and when it comes to my friends, that means a hearing them out hearing their concerns being a good friend to them doing the things for them that I would want them to do for me like being available. When I have a problem, both materially and emotionally and as far as as loyalty that just kind of goes hand-in-hand because if you haven't given me a reason to betray you. If you haven't set me up in a position where the only option I have is to harm you. The my default choice is always going to be to help you in any given situation, really, the only reason I would ever betray or be disloyal to a friend as if they had themselves constructed. The situation in such a way that doing so was important to me and if they had betrayed me first or if they were trying to harm me, Me, I might demonstrate disloyalty then but otherwise it's pretty hard to peel me away from someone that I've if I promised you my attention or my connections and you got it."

And that's typically how I behave is to look for a job that meets all of my other qualifications and necessities. First and income as a secondary concern, as long as the income is above sufficient, then it's fine. I would rather have a job with other perks besides income as far as status. I really don't care for status. I don't want to be known or have notoriety for the sake of notoriety or popularity. I do enjoy and appreciate being respected for my contributions and if my contributions naturally lead to respect and status and advancement and that's awesome. And that's what I want but I don't push to get advancement or promotion just for promotions sake. I think my actions speak for themselves and when they do feet speak for themselves, it's more impactful."

What do I bring to this team? You know why am I here? And so once I've identified kind of what my role in the team is from there I will look to build connections either with people I need to help me accomplish my job or with people who need me to do my role to do their job correctly. My goal is to know the people that I rely on and explain to them. What I'm Wiring and make what make, what I need to do for them easy. And what they need to do for me easy so that they can do their jobs and give me whatever. I need to do my job, and then in turn, do my job correctly for the people who are relying on the output of whatever I'm doing. So once I've identified that that Niche, and I've made connections with those people then I think my next goal would just be to just increase my knowledge of what the team does and what the company does, what the work is. Is and Beyond what my role is expanding my role. Or what else could I add to my role or do in? What ways? Could I improve upon this Foundation of knowledge that I've helped build?"

I'm pretty good at dealing with people. I don't know well causing me annoyances when it's a friend or someone I'm close to I may be more likely to tell them directly how I feel and say hey, whatever this thing that you're doing is bothering me please. Stop doing it. But generally when it comes to someone who either isn't doing, Intentionally or doing it has no permanent or long-lasting harm to me, you know, if it's just a annoying customer, that's they're annoying because they're upset and they're in my face. But once they leave, I'm never going to see them again. Those situations, I typically just let it wash over me or I will bottle it up and hold on to that feeling for now, I won't Express those emotions of the customer directly and then maybe go back in the break room after and complain to a friend, or a co-worker about how this customer had been annoying me. And now I feel better because I've gotten to vent a little bit. So those are those are kind of the two ways I handle annoyances depending on whether or not I have a relationship with the person who's annoying me. You're bothering me."
56cc78e3ccc0e20006b82a7d_q6_c1_1672087859_f2ee3d0b-c4ce-4376-90c5-1706260acf11,"So I think if you asked me, what you are asking me, I would say, my workplace is very rarely completely disorganized but I think if you asked literally anyone else they would say that my workplace is constantly disorganized and the reason for that is I kind of operate in the state of organized chaos, but the reason for that is in my job, in particular, I'm never on a single project from more than typically, no more than a couple of hours to a day or two, and I can be working on multiple projects at once. So, Oh it breaks up my flow to constantly be resetting things and taking stations back to blank or putting tools away just to pull them back out after I finish one project and put my screwdrivers away and then I move on to my next project which immediately requires me to go, get my screwdrivers back out, something like that. So I typically find that I flow from Project to project and I bring with me what tools are necessary. And if I don't know, you know, if I know I'm not going to need the tool like I work in electronics repair. And so if I'm going from fixing a desktop, Fixing television. I know for a fact, I'm not going to need a keyboard mouse to work on that television. So I'll take my keyboard mouse and I'll put it back away, I will need screwdrivers, I'll bring all my Screwdriver from that I was using on the PC over work on the TV whether or not I need those sizes, you know, if I don't end up meeting them up, put them away later, but that's where I can end up with things that I pulled out for project, a getting mixed, in with things that I pulled out the project. Be some of those, maybe need to get put away some of those shouldn't get put away because I'm going to carry them over to projects. See, which I'm going to start tomorrow morning. And so that's how I kind of end up. You know, I look at those things and I know what I'm working on and where they go, but for someone to just walk in and try to understand where things are and what is going on in my workflow could be considered disorganized."

I want to be active and a part of the work I'm doing. My greatest weakness would probably be that. I'm not the fastest, learner a certain skills. I'm slightly autistic. So I don't have the best people skills. I'm fairly introverted. But if you give me a task, that is so low. It's just me. I tend to do a well. I tend to work well alone, I tend to be slightly creative and pick up certain skills, quickly, more quickly than others. But I do struggle and social situations and Any situation where I have to properly, communicate can be a little tough. Again with strengths, I'm creative. Skilled, graphic designer. I Did front-end web development for a little while. I was very good at website and interface design. and, I generally I'm easy to get along with. I work, well, with most people as long as they Make an effort to get along with me, I should get along with them."

I tend to put others needs first above my own which is sometimes a problem. But generally, I make friends pretty quickly. And I get along with most people fairly well. I'm very loyal to my friends. I would do a lot more for my friends than I would do for myself some days. I care deeply for my friends. Hopefully they would just describe me as trustworthy and honest and someone who cares."

I worked for a couple internet marketing companies and some of the nature of the work I viewed is unethical and I mean I hate to admit it but I did sabotage a couple of my jobs because I just I did not support what was being promoted over the individuals that Wanted to elevate themselves in search results. So, I try to behave ethically. When it comes to children or animals, I really have very, very low tolerance for immoral Behavior. So I will sabotage my own work and risk. My own employment. If I feel like children or animals are put at risk, so that's either a plus or a minus for my employer. I have chosen to. Stray away from web development, which I was pretty good at it. I did that for a number of years website, design spewed into that, but I lost my friend and I started having trouble focusing. So I've gone away from that and that's, that's cost me a lot of money. So I've strayed into random Ventures to make money things like this. Obviously, I've done are a, I'm just trying to find that one career path that works for me, where I have a creative Outlet. and I'm doing something fulfilling, so I will sacrifice money if If there's morals or if it's something that I don't enjoy doing which is what happened with web development."

I just want to know the people I'm working with. I want to know if we're on the same page, and if we share the same goals, and if we get along, well, I think I just more than anything when I understand that you've been working with and understand who I can confide in and who I can rely on, And if they're going to be judgmental or they're going to be harsh or they're going to be overbearing or things like that, things that make them difficult to work with, in general. I also want to know if they sort of share my general philosophy and ideas on life and if I can open up to those people and potentially be friends with those people, as well as coworkers. So I want to know, there are General strength and how we complement each other and what we do. How we can balance ideas off of each other and Implement various things to get the job done. Whatever. That is generally, I work pretty well in teams. Despite being awkward, I think I'm a little stronger when I communicate the through people will attacks because I do struggle with verbal communication and like I am but yeah I think I think I do. All right, in teams. I definitely prefer a Cooperative environment where I can ask questions and help people with what I know and they can help me with what they know. See ya. I'm all right, with teams and general."

But I said, if people are harsh or critical to people who don't deserve that criticism or people are generally being jerks to those who don't deserve it, I become a little protective of others, but as far as work goes, there was a situation where I was very annoyed. We had a client when we were doing website, you grabs Graphics design, and this guy tried to Infinitely exploit Us for free work. We probably put like two weeks of work just re designing logos over and over for this guy and and then he didn't even pay us. So that was an instance where I was extremely annoying. It was, it was one of maybe a half a dozen instances like that, that year. And we had another client again, who was operating a charity website. But it became clear that we were just given him a tool to exploit people for money at some point. And I eventually like just Showcase the website to him broken. Basically, basically purposely broke it so I wouldn't end up giving him anything for you or anything that he could use to sucker people out of their money. Basically. And again, this is a client where he just kept trying to talk me down to free and eventually, like I gave him absolutely nothing but we put about 80 hours of work into that and got absolutely nothing in turn. So that's an instance where I was very annoyed, so, Having to work and not get paid. That's probably a big annoyance for me."

So for my workspace to be unorganized would be very very atypical like a very rarely happens but every once in a while I just I get overwhelmed with mail or other things in my life that are going on, you know, you end up with soda can on the desk or stack of mail somewhere, it shouldn't be and things. Get a little Oil. A little hectic. Certainly there in like, events where I had tragedies or something. Like, I might slack in terms of being organized, but it is not typical of me at all. I like to keep my workspace, very clean. I keep everything in order and I like to know where everything is like, easy access to things. I like comfortable workspace because otherwise, it's just a productivity. See, I find butt. Yeah, there's been instances where few soda cans by load up or you know a few too many letters or bank statements or something was riddled across my desk. But that's very very rare and I definitely like a clean workspace."

So we really during working hours, don't have much time. God only during breaks and afterwards. Do we actually get to the top? And then just grit my teeth and listen to me. Me, I have to listen to him regardless of how his voice dams, because I have to be in tone with my group. My group, I have to know what they're thinking and what they're feeling.

There's really no, no way that we could slow things down and get organized repeatedly after each case. But the best we can do is just stay straight down.

Note my note, the phone I get my to do list. I always have a plan. But sometimes like one of the owners we have to ask him five times, be able to actually get them to do anything.

I also paid very close. And I also pay attention to detail when giving task when given task. As for one of my greatest weaknesses, even though I do tend to pay attention to task, I can get quite hyper-focus. Actually, sometimes because of my autism, if I'm not focused on the task, I am somewhat easily distracted at that point. So sometimes I have to remind myself when I'm doing what I need to do. If I'm not currently in the process of doing a test, I tend to spend a lot of time at work thinking about other things. So sometimes if I'm not currently in the middle of starting to test her doing a test, I have to stop and remind myself what I need to do next. Yes."

So my best friend would probably describe me as a nerd, somebody who just loves Tech and works with likes, working with computers. Probably may be described as a little quirky since I have autism. Sometimes I do a little weird, something weird things in conversation. Sometimes, I have to remind myself not to talk over people and let them finish their sentence. It sometimes I talk a little too fast as I get very excited to say what I currently have on my mind and sometimes I spend the time listening in a conversation instead of just thinking about what I want to say thank. So there's a little bit of conversational issues I would guess. But overall, I think my friends would describe me As Dependable, somebody, they can depend on and somebody that like I said, just loves playing video games."

I always try to take my time and make a decision slowly. I also tend to do a lot of research when it comes to things like this. As one of my teachers taught me, I can't remember which one. I think it was at high school, maybe, or maybe College. Google is your friend, though. Actually Mai learn beds. What could we miss Moore's? But you must forgive me for getting off topic. But yet, I always take the time to do online research when it comes to important topics because I feel there's plenty enough time to research what you need and there's definitely information online. So I always spend time doing research. I'm one of those people that always try to make the best decision or at least a good, some, a better decision. So yet when it comes to make any important decisions related to my money or my life, I always spend extra time doing it but I also try to spend a lot of time researching about it.

I normally just listen to what other people have to say. And I mostly just focus on whatever we're collaborating on. I'm going to serve him to talk too much. But then again, recently, I actually have been a little more. he than I have in the past, so, I guess what I should say accurate is I like to talk to people often but when I'm done talking to people then I really am done. So overall, when I first joined a workgroup, I introduced myself maybe talk a little bit about my hobbies and then I immediately start focusing on the world as I tend to hyper, focus, on whatever task I'm currently doing,"

But, yeah, I hate when people are walking in. In front of me and they're going slow or I'm are even if I, yeah, just people just don't move out of the way, basically, how to react in that situation. Well, I react different ways depending on where I'm at. Sometimes I'll just walk faster and just overtake the person in his keep on going, on my way, when I know people tend not to light, not like that or annoys them a little bit. One of the things I often do is, I'll actually batter just stand there and just let them get so far ahead of me that they're just not in my way anymore. You know, that sounds kind of silly and I guess I realized it is. That's usually what I'll do or a possible. I'll just take a different route because I do get that Noida.

I'm not quite sure. I personally always clean my station before I leave so it's not like you don't have the time to do it. I guess some people just don't particularly care.

I'm going to admit, I'm not as organized as a lot of people, I tend to take paperwork, and just throw it into a drawer and it piles up. And then I have to figure out. Where did this, where was this supposed to go in time? I'm so I think that part of it is Over cannibal. If that's a word I can overcome that by enlisting other people's help to try to help me to organize. I have worked as a manager before and I used to actually use one of the other employees to help me out with my organization system and then try to keep it up. So I'm not going to say I'm perfect as far as trying Try to overcome that but I do. I do try to find ways to do that once again because I do want to excel.

I try to conscientiously do the right thing and I try to benefit others. Not just myself. I don't think I'm bragging when I say that I believe that's really true. My stepfather. Italy was in the hospital and he put all of his finances in my care because he knew he could trust me to do the right thing and not to take any of his money. So I think that speaks to probably the type of person that my friends see me as my friends. Also know if if they ever need anything, they can come to me. And when I give somebody something, you know, they'll say well, can you loan me some money? I'll tell them if I didn't have it together. Of to you. I wouldn't give it to you. So basically it's up to them whether they pay me back or not. I'm never going to bug anybody. And when you put that kind of trust in people, they tend to respond positively and they try their hardest to do right by you just as you have done for them. So my friends would also describe me as being a fun person. I don't go out on the The town a lot, but when I do, I I'm I like to joke around.

It was just that the company decided to close the office where I was and I had an opportunity to go to another location and another state and make more money. however, with that decision, I decided not to take it and I decided to stay in the area where I live. Now, the reason why is because I am family-oriented and it's something any job has to understand about me. And, you know, if there's ever a situation where job wouldn't take me because of that, then it would just basically be their loss. I hate to put it that way, but that's the truth. I'm a very loyal employee. I give my 100% Sen tall when I'm there. However, when it comes to sacrificing my family, I'm not willing to do that. And that is the reason why I wasn't willing to move, it was to Las Vegas. I have a teenage son and he has a lot of friends and he enjoys his school and so forth and it just didn't make sense to me to move to make just to make more money. It wasn't really even Enough to justify such a move, but it really had to do with family. I also wanted to be close to my mother, which I'm glad that I did not leave for that. I just lost my mother a couple of months ago, but because I didn't move, I was able to spend many more years with her that I would not have been able to spend so it was the right choice. Money is not everything in the world. And it's nice to have just to be secure, but when it comes to sacrificing your family I feel like money's not worth it. So that's basically my life attitude if you will and I have not regretted that at all that I did not move."

So I will sit down and just start asking questions automatically and trying to understand the type of personalities that I'm sitting with. So I think that's important. You have to, you really have to get a beat on the type of people that you're with so that you will First and their strengths, and their weaknesses and you will be able to assign them the proper tasks. That's another thing. Usually, whenever I'm with a group of people, I just automatically assume I'm going to be the leader and it doesn't, you know, every now and then I'll come across a situation where I go ahead and give it over to somebody else. But I tend to be that kind of person that will Just sit down and take charge. Like what I said about just getting to getting to know everybody and trying to encourage conversation in the beginning. You know, without taking up too much of our work time, I think it is important to get that kind of thing out of the way so that we can focus on our work and not be thinking. Oh, I wonder if I just said something wrong if that might have Not been acceptable to that person or whatever. So, you know, I just think it's important because everybody is different and you have to understand who you are working with."

So my 15 year old son, I gave him a new computer for Christmas. He likes to play games. And so I actually went out and tried to find a really beefy computer for him, but he was working on setting it up and he wanted help. Help with fixing, a an image to be as his Google Chrome passed the background, sorry, but he was having trouble with it and he asked for my help. Well, you know, I think first of all, he did not like to ask for my help him, he likes to think that he can do anything. I can do even though I am very Savvy with computers and he knows that. So the thing that annoyed me Is when he asks me for help and then I come over and try to help him. He's very impatient and he will just click click click while I'm trying to figure out the situation and understand exactly what he's asking for and what to do. And he was just doing that last night. Click click click. That is one of the most annoying things that anybody can do when I'm working with them is to not, listen to me and just click click click and I think that's because Well, I mean obviously it's annoying because they will click away from what you're reading and they will just get ahead of where you want to be. So, the way that I respond to it, is I just take a deep breath and I told him, I said, look, you are going to have to slow down and you're going to have to listen to me because I know how to do this. But if you don't listen to me, we're going to be here all night trying to do this So it turned out what he was trying to do. He was taking an image and saving it as a web page and I showed him ways that he could save it other otherwise, and it did actually work finally, and he thanked me, but I guess other people's impatience is what really gets on my nerves. And that's what annoys me the most. And the way that I handle it, as I will actually stop take a deep breath before I react negatively. Lee and just ask them to please listen to me and let me help them."

And most things I do actually on the computer, I try to have as much of a paperless work environment as possible, but I'm just speaking to those things that I do have to do with paperwork, and I just have to throw it in a drawer somewhere. Well actually, let me speak to the computer part of it. Sometimes I'll be on organized there to. I'm am way more organized on a computer than I am with just my physical workspace, but you can actually become rather unorganized on a computer as well. So that's not typical of me. The paperwork is, but it's not very typical of me to be an organized on the computer but it has Happened and what I'll usually do is, I'll just take a morning, you know, before everything. Like I might come in a little early to work and I will just sit down and create a bunch of folders on my desktop and go ahead and try to take that junk folder on my computer and, and organize it in a better fashion. Why am I unorganized? I don't know, maybe it was the way I was raised. My mother was not very much a very good housekeeper and she didn't expect us to to be very, very organized either. So that's probably the reason why I'm that way but I do try to do things to help myself. You know as I said I will every now and then take a moment to go through everything I need to go through and if it's a high priority item I mean that's a no-brainer. I just automatically handled. A business and get that out of the way, so there's no chance to be disorganized with it."

I would say my greatest strength as an employee is I always take on a lot so when it comes to my previous position, I am moved on to training all the new employees. I was helping with onboarding, all the new employees. So I guess really training and just like showcasing the knowledge, I have and an easily digestible way, is my biggest strength and a couple of my other strengths would be just on very dependable. So I am never one to be late or really call off unnecessarily. As for weaknesses. I do have a few I would say that sometimes I can be a little too accepting of the status quo and I don't challenge it as often as I should and that's something I'm working on. Also another weakness I would say would be that I can be a little it'll to understanding with people and I need to be more firm. So those are two of the weaknesses but I do believe my strengths are very strong especially in the realm of training and just development of employees. So yeah."
58509fbda6946500016117ed_q2_c1_1672162890_19ae78db-d402-45af-bff9-98e745f2d774,"Great question. I think my best friend would describe me as someone that is, is very kind in giving with their time and this translates to the workplace, and also just my personal friendships. But when I have the opportunity to just be there for someone or show value, and whatever way I can, that is something that I always strive to do. So when it comes to me with friendship, these are people that I care deeply about. Out. And these are people that I would freely give my time in order to make them happy. So, that's one thing that I think I'd be proud of when it comes to any of my relationships is that they know that they can depend on me if they ever have any issues. Or if there's anything uncomfortable that they want to talk about, I am one that's not going to judge. I'm a person who I strive and try very hard every day to be understanding and to not judge because I've obviously been Rue some situations as well that are rough and their heart and life is hard. So yeah. And I think that again would transition and US transition to any job because if you don't care about your fellow co-worker or your fellow flight manager, anybody in general in the workplace it's just not going to be an ideal place to work. So if you have people that go to bat for each other every day or are willing to take on more just to make the other person more Floor. Help them through some time that they're going through. That, is that something that I always try to do."

So another great question when it comes to making professional decisions and kind of like finding my own way in a job or an assignment or whatever. Basically, the way that I look at it as I'm very risk-averse. So that is a plus and a minus depending on the situation. But I'm one that would rather look at all sides of the situation. Figure out what the pros and cons. Tsar and then figure out if the pros outweigh the cons and whatever given situation. So with me, I'm never one to make a rash decision and again, that can I wouldn't say hurt my professional chances or anything like that. But it, it some people just automatically are like yeah, by the way, I think I'm going to roll with that and they just go full force into it. And I wouldn't say that I would never act that way if I was absolutely sure of the situation. But I'm just again one that would rather carefully plan and then execute on things. So I think that's just because of my nature. I'm not one that jumps into things, I'm not one that is that likes disorder. I like just having order and understanding of processes and then making a value-based judgment on those on those processes. So, yeah, I just tend to be that type of person and it's never steered me wrong yet. And I have seen other people jump into things and sometimes it goes well and sometimes it backfires. So I'd rather just take the tried-and-true method that I've already learned and always been and just take a little extra time to fully understand what's going on. Before I jump in,"
58509fbda6946500016117ed_q4_c1_1672163180_19ae78db-d402-45af-bff9-98e745f2d774,"So yeah, that's a great question. When it comes to new teams I know a lot of people are like nervous out of the block and everything like that. I am I wouldn't even say nervous. I'm a little may be tentative on how I come off because I always, you know, want to come off in a good way and I'm an introvert by nature but that by no means is an indication of being being shy. It's just a lot of the time, I like to fully process what's going on before I just jump in. So for me, if I was in a new team today, I would, I would obviously be friendly and open to meeting new people and talking to new people. And I would probably not speak a whole lot for the first little bit, just to kind of fill things out. I'm not going to tell anybody my life story. The first day they meet me and this is kind of how I am. And I know that's because and I think this way Because again I just take a very measured approach to life. I would much rather like observe for a little bit kind of get a feel for the team. Get a feel for the personalities on the team and then figure out where I can add value, figure out, where, you know, I can I can make an end with some people on the team and, you know, maybe become friends or whatever. But again, it's always going to be a measured response. When Charmaine. So I always kind of think it through and and look at various outcomes before I just immediately jump in and tell someone my life story. Try to meet that other people, that kind of mesh well with that. And, and the one from there."

No matter if you're at work, maybe you're just at the store. Maybe it's someone that your family with, or even friends with, there's always going to be situations and times where my personality may not mesh well with another personality and vice versa, someone's personality May rub me the wrong way. The way I look at it is a part of life. It is what it is not, everyone is going to get along, not everyone is going to be best friends and that's how it is and if it happens in the workplace you have to work together. There's not a situation where you can just not work together because you don't get along. So, the way I look at it and this has been very rare, but there have been personality clashes In the past it's more of just a yeah. Maybe we're not going to be best friends but we can how can we work effectively as a unit or as a team together and I just kind of try not to bend over backwards for for what they're needing. But just try to give them a little extra Grace. When I'm, maybe they're having a bad day or maybe they just don't want to talk. And I just have to figure out how to best work with their personality without Making them miserable without making them upset or angry all the time, just figure out a way for our personalities to best mesh, so that we can somehow effectively become a team. And that is very common in the workplace."
58509fbda6946500016117ed_q6_c1_1672163438_19ae78db-d402-45af-bff9-98e745f2d774,"See ya. This is very rare. I am one of the more organized people that I know. I always structure my my work in a way that I fully understand it, and that I can easily jump back in. If I'm ever extracted, there have been times generally, say I'm on call for like the holiday week or something. There are times when that's not always the case where I can't always fully be prepared. But if I'm at my desk either, Working from home, or in the office I would say that I would be one of the if not the most organized people there. But again, that's just a typical process of mine is just trying to become as organized as possible just to make my mind more at ease because the more the more things become on organized or the more things become chaotic or whatever however you want to look at it is is My mind has trouble just kind of struggling, trying to figure out the purpose. And that's a big thing in my mind is, as I have to understand the purpose of why this is here, why, this is there, why do we do things certain ways? So, the more organized I can make my life, the better it is for my work life and my personal life. So I will always strive to be someone that is, that is organized and that that if you look at my workplace, my my sea or wherever, It's always going to be something has a place, and that place has values. I think that's important."

When I was a correctional officer. I made a lot of decisions that eventually led to my promotion to Correctional Sergeant because I like to, I like to fix problems when I see them. So I would see problems in the system or in the process or in the application of work and I would bring up a plausible solution or multiple solutions to my supervisors, enable in order to help push things through and that ended up having them see me as leadership material and push me towards standing a Sergeant's interview and eventually running facility.

I like to watch the situation, watch the people, and see how everybody interacts and see what my place will be in that set up. I A lot of times I end up being somehow in charge of things, but I'm reluctant to do that. So it's not something that I jump into. I very much prefer to see how Everybody is behaving so that I can work alongside them. Well I think that's because I have had people jump into existing groups and just try to run things and man it's terrible. It's one of the most frustrating things when someone steps in and upsets the group dynamic, just because they can and I don't ever want to be part of that situation."

Roll off your back, there are always going to be people who are saying, You're doing something that I don't love and it just doesn't really matter unless they are signing my paycheck and even if that's the case, most of the time we can have a civil discussion and come to a good arrangement and things will get settled without everybody leaving upset."

Considering that. They were part of the job requirements upon being hired. I'm a very patient person. So I don't let them or anyone else. See my frustration or annoyance? But a gentle nudge in the right direction. May be needed at times. Times. Usually, I can tolerate a lot specially being in healthcare, but I think it's really important to focus on the more important things and kind of brush those things off. Unless if you expect, they're going to be a continuous problem. Then you might want to address it with that person and if necessary address it with the person above them,"

And what kind of Mills do they want for that date? Now they figured out, we could have menus and pass them out, but they did not assign who would be doing this. So there was debate among the RAS and the dining stuff about who should do this. You know, the RAS like myself thought that dining stuff shouldn't do it since it was their idea and it falls under dining responsibilities. But then the Dining set for like, oh well, you know, you guys go to all the room so you can just pass them out while you're here. But then they didn't consider that, we have short time. So their residents and some of them will have multiple questions and we can't really afford to spend an extra 10 minutes, helping a resident, decide what they mean, want for lunch. Luckily, we were able to hold a meeting and get all of that dress. And now we have Night Shift, pass out. The Mills because generally night shift is not busy at all, especially after six pm, and we can get all of the menus back, and all of the residents concerns address without applying any additional stress on Ras or dining staff."

I love working with others. I love really putting ideas together and figuring out a solution that's going to fit a lot of different parties. One of the things that are really focused on in a workplaces, but understanding that you don't want to solve just for a bubble or for one single person, you really want to do things that are going to work for a system as best as as possible. I think I've got a great sense of positivity and humor that I can bring two situations. No matter how stressful or complicated that they are. I want to keep things light and I've found that that also helps work with other people as well. And you know one of the things that I that I think of a lot I like to come up with Creative Solutions or things that are outside the box. I like to approach things from a little bit of a Different angle whenever it makes sense. Just to, you know, try to Spur ideas that are going to work for everybody. One of my one of my weaknesses is probably just Time management in the, in the sense that I tend to get looped into a lot of different things. So, one of the things that I really try to work on is being mindful of what projects I say. Yes to, and making sure that I'm managing my workload on the way that I can be very effective in everything that I'm involved in."

I think they describe me as somebody who gets Hobbies or things that they're interested in and becomes very moved and them throughout the year. And and seasonally when baseball season comes. I'm all in on baseball when it's live music season. Also, I want to see as many concerts as I can. Once the weather gets nice. It is somebody who goes who goes all-in and is very passionate about the things that they're interested in. And that also describe me as somebody who loves food and cooking and eating all sorts of things and really exploring all the different food that is, Available in my neighborhood."

And you know for me I try to look at all of those sorts of things as a balance and I my wife has a career as well too and we also have a child. So, the way that I'm looking things that now, so differently than when I looked at it, when I was first, Fresh out of school and extremely ambitious, and always trying to rise and rise and rise and take on more and more and more, no matter what. I'm a little more sensitive and valuing of my personal time, as well as my work life balance. There are things outside of work and I want to be around for and want to make sure that I'm able to to obtain. So, you know, those are things that are seriously consider probably to a higher degree than I that I previously would have. But also when there are projects that I can get involved on that, I think can raise my general status within the organization that I'm at. I certainly don't run away from them. I think I've been pretty generally known as somebody who's not afraid to roll up their sleeves and work really hard to get things done. When when that's the the time or place to do it, why I always run towards those things? Instead of a way I like to think of Of my background. I worked a lot of restaurant jobs, everything from washing dishes, to bussing tables, to waiting tables to being behind a bar. And I just think of like the customer service element of all of that. And, you know, I think of my co-workers, as my customers, I want to help them and assist any way possible that I can."

I always want to assist and help out right away any way that I can presumably, I'm being brought to a team for a reason, but I want to be mindful of existing Dynamics and not be seen as somebody who is walking. In and taking over a trying to impose their own will or expectations on others. I don't think that necessarily comes off. Well it kind of I don't want to be someone who's shooting first and asking questions later, I would prefer to observe the Dynamics, how things get done. What's working and what's not working from that, or from that unit as it is and try to make that. A determination of how I can assist or help. Similarly, like personally if I join a friend group, I tend to be I want to be outgoing and friendly and talk to them. What I'm talking to those people newly in a new situation but I also don't tend to be the dominant person right at the gate trying to take over or adjust or set plans for everybody else. Just want to be Part of the team."

Pretty, if I had my way, I can think of lots of things, I would like, done in certain forms or formats and that tends to be for a reason in a lot of cases. But then other guys, as it's just because I tend to stick to certain ways of doing things, and anytime there's a deviation, I'm going to notice them. It doesn't mean I'm not okay with it, but it can mean that it can be slightly annoying or getting slightly under my skin. As I've got a little older a little Wiser. I've learned to just kind of acknowledge it. Internally, but be okay with it. Like you not everything has to be done. Exactly in the way that I would prefer to have it done. And that I just kind of need to let go of some of those expectations or need for control in every situation."
5977e3867412f8000194e1fe_q6_c1_1672177514_23ee3917-133a-4ab3-a7f7-33faf055d7a1,"So, I wouldn't necessarily say it's typical that my actual work product is not organized, but there can be times where internally I'm holding myself to a standard that is higher than I'm going to be able to turn out in a, in an initial amount of time. I would prefer to have all my eyes dotted and T's crossed when I submit something that I can answer, all the questions that I know that I would have inside my own mind, if I was on the receiving end of a presentation and sometimes Demands. Don't allow me to be in a place where I'm able to present that right out the gate. So I do sometimes get very critical of my own work product before presented but I find that that can be an internal driver to get me to it. Better end result of her end product. Now I want to call him a workspace, sometimes my workspace can be a little untidy. It never gets to like total disaster area of levels but It certainly, it's not uncommon for me to have papers or other knickknacks or things that just kind of gathered us cuz I don't put them away or put them directly in that, right space. I think it's because those things there and it's not immediately on my focus. My focus is getting back to my laptop and getting back to work."

Think of situations when you made a professional decision, that would affect my status. Why do you think that is a situation? You made a decision that could affect your status or how much money you make situations? Like when I was a office manager at a newspaper I had to make decisions on. What, you know, a lot of things. How That's you know, if, if somebody got taken to court for collections, you know, you had to know you work with people first, before you took him to court. You know, you did, that's definitely going to lose, probably a customer but, you know, I had to try all things. I could possibly think of to try to get them to pay their bill and if they did, and then I had to take a quart and I could affect future sales and profits. and so if I didn't do that, my job, well then I wouldn't get a raise probably and not getting a raise would means that you people know, If they knew then they would know that you didn't, you weren't doing a good job. And so you were on the down on the couch or whatever with the management so How do I behave? I tried to do as good a job as possible because I want to keep my job to pay my bills."

I'm usually quiet and try and you're trying to be funny and friendly. That's usually about it. You know, you don't want to, you know, if I will speak up if nobody speaking that maybe, you know, so that You know, the boss is wanting us to somebody to say something or express yourself. Stop felt comfortable, I would say it, you know, but usually I'm pretty quiet at first. I get to know everyone, so you don't want to be too aggressive or whatever, aggressive to sort of to bring, you know, bring it up, ideas to change things, you know, it might be a trick question, who knows? So you want to be careful at first. I mean I would be and just to you got, you know, you got settled in there, it's a new job in a lot of new people and new personalities, and they made worked together for years. And so there could be there's long-term relationships there and you don't want to miss them up or miss yourself up by doing something. They might not like,"

People usually aren't trying to annoy you. That's not their fault that your reaction. So I usually keep my reaction to myself. So that You know, I don't want to say be so arrogant, you know, I stopped doing that so I would just, you know, if I didn't know that person. Well, depends on what you knew. I would get away from him, if it was that annoying, I would remove myself from the situation and not say anything, you know, unless it was in a very, very bad if it was very, very bad, I would leave. So I probably went to say much because I don't want to start a fight with somebody just because they're doing something I don't like."

How how typical is out of, you know, I'm usually very organized, and I like chaos chaotix, and situations where there's a lot of stuff that around. So you don't know what's there because you're so much stuff. So I like minimalist, plain areas that are organized, so that can find things. And so it looks neat and clean and not dirty or mess, you know, messy and confusing and chaotic. Why don't what? I don't like, what I like. Clean. Organized things they're easier to find. They look better. And they're not nasty."

I take a long time and make sure that I pay attention to close detail. And that way I try to get the job done as thoroughly as possible. At the same time, that could be considered my greatest weakness as I fear that sometimes in going for the detail, you actually go over the amount of time that you have to do a task. And I tend to end up taking the full amount of time possible to complete each task. And in some cases that might not be the main goal. But I always try to do my best in either case."

I would not be the life of the party per se, but I will be someone who would always say something that hits home. That makes them think and also their, if a loyal person, someone who they can count on when they need help and someone who will just laugh at their jokes and just hang out without having to do too much, I'm not the friend who would get them into trouble or anything. Like that. I will be the level-headed one of the group. I think all of those adjectives would describe me, or at least the way I think my best friend would describe me."

So in situations where I need to make a professional decision that could affect my status and how much money I make. I typically try to think of two things and now first, I don't particularly feel that I'm money minded. So I'm not simply worried about the maximum amount of money I can make. I do have career goals and that those are what usually described in control, my behavior know situations and along with those career goals. I do have a family so my family also comes in there. R & between those two. Bits of information between those two competing, you know, ideas that work in my mind, I feel that that's what really controls my behavior, no situations. I feel that way because the most important thing to me, like I said, is not money, it is my family. And also, what I feel like I want to do with my career with my life, what I want to enjoy doing for the next 10, 20, 30 years. Those are the most important things to me."

But I also at the same time, understand that people are different. And for me to get the best amount of enjoyment out of working with a team and for the, from the myself, to be able to actually work with the team effectively. I really need to know who I'm working with. So in that manner, I will stay quiet and just listen as much as possible. I will just follow the prompts from the beginning. Yes. Initially like a new employee. And just let whatever, you know it's going on, the team, just happened and try to get an understanding of it. And then, once I do that, then I'm able to open up more and speak my mind. I do want to be a part of the team and not take over the team. So, in that case, that's what that's why I would 10 act like that."

If I do get upset when annoyed, which most people do, I try to not react immediately and instead, I try to stay quiet and the Sure I stay away the longer I will B have time to calm down and once I calm down then I'm able to think I tend to think better when my feelings are at an even Keel neither High nor low and so, in that case, I would do that so that I can think and why do I want to thank? That's basically, because I would much rather like to understand the, why I don't like people being upset at me and the same. I don't like, you know, being annoyed by people. I feel that when you're annoyed by someone that happens because they're doing it usually on purpose, you know, in that case, maybe you've done something. So, I want to try to figure that out in another case, it could be, that that's just the way they are or if they're in the middle of something. So, I always want to give that benefit and just make sure that nothing is going on. That, you know, could warrants. Each behavior and maybe adjust myself in that situation."

That's not very typical of me. I do like to end the day. The way I started more or less through my school career and through my previous career at other jobs, I like to keep the place as minimalistic is possible, and that's one way to keep clutter. and and, you know, the situation not being organized at Bay, but when that does happen, You know, there's it's just problems I can't work and so I try my best not to allow my workspace to get unorganized because I do need to be able to focus on to work. And like I said, that's just not a typical thing that happens to me."

I tend to look at all of the work and all the projects that I have going on a weekly basis and consistently check in with my stakeholders to make sure that we are focusing on the right things. So I'm really good at At being able to keep people organized and in line and really balance those priorities. I would say, one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get a little bit bored. I really like the incubation phase, the get up and do phase. And then when something is off and running, I find myself getting a little bored because I do like to be in more of an Innovative type of role we're constantly where I'm constantly Only creating. So I would say that is a weakness that when things were moving the way that they should, I tend to get a little bored and want to move onto to the next thing."

I think that he would say that I tend to be very silly. So I like to joke around a lot. I like to just make sure that everyone is having fun around me. Even if that means that I'm coming across a little bit silly. I think that they would say that I'm intelligent. I really do thrive on learning new things. On my free time, I typically in a online course where I'm learning anything from how to create a robot to, you know, doing a book review on a classic English, literature piece. And then the last thing I would say is that they would say that I'm just a little strange. I always see things from a different perspective or am always able to find some interesting way of looking at At something that kind of makes them pause and go, huh? I didn't really think about it that way. So I would say my best friend, my husband would describe me as someone who is silly, as someone who is intelligent and thrives on learning new things. And I would say that they would say that I'm a little bit on the strange side which in a very good way."

One time I did change my status as an employee, I was responsible for launching a very large customer service center and I once it was up and running, I had managed it for about About a year and then I really like reflected on my skill set. I reflected on dings. I get me excited and managing a team of, you know, 40 data entry people while they were very talented and did a wonderful job was just something I couldn't get excited about. I was really struggling in that decision because, you know, managing a very large Department comes with a certain level of cachet and excitement around the Asian. But I knew that I could probably use my skills in a way that would better serve the organization and better serve myself. So I took some real time to think about what my next move could look like and worked with my manager to find a role that while not as glamorous as managing a large team. Really serve the organization and and serve myself better. And so that was to move into more of a business. Strategy roll instead, it didn't affect my money, but, you know, I became more of an individual contributor versus a manager at that time."

And the reason why I approached joining a new team this way, is because I never want to go into a situation or give off the impression that I think, I know best. Best when people have long-standing relationships and long-standing ways of doing things. So I think for me, it's best to obviously be very approachable and really focus on getting to know people, but to also just take a step back and observe what the Dynamics are. What's going really well? For the team were some opportunities that I can help the team succeed in ways that maybe they're not currently doing so. So, typically, tan tend to just sort of stand back. Back. Watch the dynamic and then we'll start engaging. Once I get a little bit more comfortable and understand sort of the politics and the Dynamics around the group."
599e1bb6c6dab70001403c52_q5_c1_1671662923_4690d3e1-3475-4de1-8c65-274ef47e1db7,"So when I'm working, I try really hard not to get overly emotional or overly in my feelings when something is happening. So at work, when someone frustrates me or annoys me, I typically will try to maybe exit the conversation and take a step back and reflect on what's causing me annoyance. Is it something I'm doing? Is it something? The person is doing? Is it a misunderstanding? Now and then pick it back up and talk through it again. I tend to just really try to not let it build and, you know, try to reflect and figure out what ways that I could come have contributed to that. And I'm also very outspoken when it comes to these things. I actually had a situation like this. The other day when I was working in a team, a work team project. And one of the hope people that I typically work, Who's usually very jovial and in a good mood just wasn't and was providing a lot of negative energy to the team. I didn't really outwardly address it while we were on the call because I didn't want to make it awkward for everyone. But today after I had some time to reflect I did call them one-on-one and express my frustration and how they were coming across and just made sure I wasn't doing anything to hurt the situation further. And she kind of explained to me what was causing her to do that. And now that She's been made aware of how she comes across in the energy. She brings into the group, she was apologetic and has agreed that she'll work on, you know, kind of keeping the emotions away when she gets frustrated."

I would say that's probably very much me right now even though the lockdowns are over, I do have a job where I work remote full time, I live in a major city in a very small apartment and so things just tend to get messy. And, you know, the good thing about working remote is that people only see me from the neck up most times. With a blurred background. So I don't really have to worry about people judging me. But I think for me, anyway, the workspace around me being organized is not, has not been a hindrance to me, being able to be successful. I tend to be very organized when it comes to my desktop and my email and my projects and things like that. So that I know exactly where I'm at. Where I'm at. What the priorities are. Erhu, I need to get back to, but when it comes to, my overall Works Space, sometimes it's just messy and and I it's typical and I don't really think that it's a problem that impacts my ability to do my job effectively."

I am very easy to get along with and I really let things kind of roll off my shoulders and I always have time to listen to someone else. I think it's important for everyone to have someone that they can talk through throughout talk with throughout the day sometimes things bother us that start to feel like they're very big deal when they're really not and it's just nice to have someone to talk to you. So what I think I add to a workplace as an employee is that strength of being approachable to other people. I'm also very loyal and very dependable. So I will be there when things need to get done and I will be there for other people. Should anybody else need anything? And so, I believe in being on time I believe in being responsible to others just that that that group Unity is very important to me and I like to bring everyone together."

I'm upbeat and I like to be energetic when I'm with other people and when I'm out and about and doing things, I like to try new things, typically I pay attention to local events and things that are happening. I hate to hear that something. Fun came through town and I missed your chance to be a part of it due to being Risk of burst. I don't really like to do things that are dangerous. I also try to be Thrifty, I'm very responsible money. So my friends would also say that I'm creative about finding when things to do. So I'm outgoing. I'm resourceful, I'm energetic.

I tend to be very careful with my spending and I pay attention to what I have in the bank. So when it comes to decisions that affect how much money I make, I really do look at the bottom line. It's important to me to do the most, I can with the least that I have. To put forward to, you know, in my personal life, as far as savings go. So when I make professional decisions much like a business makes decisions they make decisions for their bottom line. So I do think about the bottom line and it makes in my life as far as how a decision will affect my status and how much money I make. Of course, I need to think about myself. So, you know, I'm a little business and that way too. Running to look out for my own best interest. I guess, you know, like a shareholder would with the company. So I make decisions based on what is going to benefit me. However, it is important to me to be ethical to be professional in my actions. My professional reputation is important to me. So while I do value, Things that bring value to my life.

I enjoy You working with teams where you work with the same people over years and you build relationships and you build loyalty, I find the value in that.

I get pretty carried away with work projects and throwing my attention into them. So an annoyance to the extent that it's something like an interruption. I can be very impatient with that. So I try to Always kind of stopped take a breather when I'm feeling annoyance. I don't want any response to annoyance to come across as anger when it's just a normal brush tration. I think that it can be damaging to work relationships. So when I'm annoyed again, I just try to take meat if it is something that is passing that is annoying. Me, you know, if someone's doing something That I find annoying and I know, but it's temporary situation or try to be patient with it. If it is something that is a more permanent nature than that would be something that I would want to address early on in a proactive way, especially if it's in a team environment. And it's something with another team member. I would certainly want others to approach me quickly and proactively rather than waiting. And becoming increasingly annoyed. So you know you have to judge if it should be dealt with without with patients or with a quick response, so that things don't grow and become bigger problems."

Then in that situation, my workspace with kind of reflect what was going on. So in times when my work space was not organized, that would be simply because of kind of you know literally taking something apart putting it back together. I like to see documents. I like to see things on paper. So when I need to take that information in, I will often have all of those things in a paper form kind of around me so that I can visualize the information. So, when my workspace is unorganized due to having a lot of things out or a lot of things around, that usually correlates directly to something that I Working on or it could also be a situation of facing a deadline and becoming focused on that and other things kind of build up. Or, you know, you really are just kind of moving things from place to place and organization, it's just from putting things away. So sometimes it is deadline based and you just don't have the time to keep up with the file name.

I think that's my strongest strength or one of my strongest strength as far as weaknesses. It is always a hard question because you don't want to say, well I don't do this well or I don't do that well. But personally, I think one of the weaknesses that I have is I am much more effective. If I am busy than if I am not if I have a lot of tasks on my plate, I'm more likely to kind of get in the zone. And you know, get to work where if I just have one or you know a few then it's it's harder for me to grab it and embrace it because I know that I'll be done and left with nothing to do.

I have seen people through my career struggle with just saying hey look that you know that one was on me. That was my fault. I think it makes you so much more of A stronger person. If you can just go ahead and say that and I think often times people are afraid that, that, that might have monetary ramifications or status ramifications. I Good, bad or other have always just own up to my mistakes. I think that there is the opportunity when you do that for you to end up being the scapegoat and perhaps not getting an increase that you deserve or Not getting a promotion that you deserve, but I don't know. Is that everything? I think? I think being true to yourself is the the real reward, very money driven. So it's hard for me to say that, but, yeah, the real reward is being true to yourself."

If you will and you know, it requires a different wardrobe, I different attitude, a different Behavior. It was, it was a big deal and and although I had the skills, it was, it was just strange, it wasn't even like a smooth transition. It was bam.

I guess what comes directly to mind with this question. So I guess it's probably the most relevant as I worked with a co-worker that's at right across from me. For years and I was very, very tolerant of her needs. She She was very needy person. And it got to the point where she was controlling the temperature in the office. The smells in the office, the Sounds in the office, the lighting in the office. And I think the straw that broke the camel's back as she started. Controlling my workflow, even though she was, you know, she was a contemporary. She was the same level as I was, but You know, she would get my business and say what are you doing? And I tell her and she's she would say, oh, I would do it like this. And I am always always up for hearing another way to do something, especially if it's better. Correct. So, you know she would show me and she wasn't always right in my opinion but a couple of time she did that and I would just try to be Be as, you know, easygoing as I possibly could, but a couple of times she did it, she did whatever task it was wrong and not only did she do it wrong, but she, there was irreparable. I mean, it. What I had to start from scratch instead of, you know, Being able to use the wisdom that she gave me to make my project better. And so I finally did have to go to my manager. I didn't put anything in writing, but I did go make black a little time with him and say, you know, it's gotten a little ridiculous in my neck of the woods so that worked out well and he was able to counsel her and it looks like I'm running out of time but after after him counseling, her things were a lot smoother."

Well, physically, well, physically and electronically, I'm both very organized. I like things to make sense. I like things to be easily retrieved. That's a big deal with the me. People come to me and say, you know, do you remember that such and such from six years ago and I'm like, yep. Got it guys. Yeah. I like to have my stuff in order. I like to be able to find it but I do recall. Call or as soon as I read this question, I had a flashback where were we were working on a project and it required actually printing the stuff out and editing it on paper. And it wasn't just you know a paper that came to it was a stack like this and it was coming like three times a day and You know, I would write my stuff on it and you know, say what needed to be changed. What was correct, what you know what my thoughts were, but it was getting backed up, but I was having Stacks upon Stacks, upon stacks and sometimes the edits on the first stack you know, were opposite from the edits on the third stack. And I knew that there was going to be a problem there and it was just it was it just was really awful for me so we ended It up half and to say, okay, stop dead stop. Let's get this done and then we can go on and start making new Stacks. But yeah, there had to be a time where we stopped the craziness got organized and started again. And yeah, it happened. Several times before the project was over, but, you know, at some point you're doing more harm than good. So, That's what just came to my mind. All those stacks on my desk."

I'm also a completely Relentless person when you give me a task or an assignment or Duty, I carried out like Like my life depends on it as far as weaknesses. I don't have many being a creative type, I get distracted, a little bit easy, but I also am able to focus and overcome that. My other strengths are that I work well with other people or I work well by myself, I'm happy doing either. And I enjoy the collaborator of things that come with being on a team. But I also enjoy working by myself. My other weaknesses. I wouldn't say that I have many besides like I said, kind of having difficulty Focus sometimes but other than that, I think you'll find me to be a determined Relentless person who takes great, great pride in his work.

I don't make professional decisions. Based on status status is never meant a lot to me job titles, don't necessarily mean a lot to me. I want to be able to do a job that I enjoy in the contributes in the adds value to a company, as opposed to just enriching myself or making having a fancy title. As far as decisions that affect, how much money I make again? You know, I take a job because I enjoy the challenge, money is important. But money is not the driving factor in the kind of work I do or the kind of job decisions. I've made over the years. I am careful with my money and I do and I'm careful with a company's money. So I'm Frugal at home and at work and I think that's a good way to be when especially being a steward of a His money. As for why I think that is, I've just always been that way. I started out not making much money.

I'm honest direct, I'm empathetic but I don't try to be someone. I'm not I don't try to fit into the team, just for the sake of fitting in. I like to show what I can contribute in the thought the value added that I can bring to the father and the creative and the technical process. But I don't subvert my Personality to that of the team. And I think most people tend to appreciate that over the long run. When I join a new team of people, I also like to listen as much as I talk, I like to kind of hear what kind of other ideas and approaches people bring to the table and make up my mind about them and their role on the team before I before I make any snap judgments about them and how they work. So when I join a new team, I tend to sit back a little bit. I can contribute my thoughts so that people can get to better understand, my thinking, and my thought process. But at the same time, I also kind of lead. By example, I'm quiet when I'm need to be, I'm forceful, when I need to be and I always, always, always emphasized the importance of communication and deadlines because nothing's better than knowing if there's a problem with the team deadline that you have the communications in place to overcome that,"

I tend to kind of step back and try to understand. Okay, why is this person knowing me? What am I, what can I do to help? Get them out of their annoying mode. What have I done? That might have put them in that annoying mode. So rather than react externally in a way that they can understand kind of tend to step back and assess the situation, and try to decide how I can approach things better, that can keep them from being annoying. Some people just don't understand their annoying and there's not a whole lot, you can do with them, but when there are chances to step back and kind of modify their behavior by working on things that prevent them from being, Annoying. That's usually what I try to do and I found over the years, that that's a great approach. Now there's some people who are just so obnoxious and annoying. If there's nothing you can do about it, then you have to push back on them a little bit harder. But for the most part, I think it's better to step back, and observe human nature and see how you can adjust their attitudes through your own attitudes. It's not something that a lot of people do but I found it works very well over time."

My workspace isn't the most physically organized in the workplace but you know what? I always know where every document is. I always know where things are that I need. And My workspace organization makes me feel comfortable and when I feel comfortable, I do my best work. So the person passing by looking at my desk, might think hmmm that's a little bit unusual or that's different, but I think there's a certain amount of mindset that comes with having a perfectly neat workspace. I think it's a waste of time and I think it says something about you in terms of productivity, if your workspace is completely uncluttered, it just shows that you're spending all your time on organizing your workplace and not on actually doing the work that comes with your job. Why do I think that is? Again I'm comfortable in my work environment even though to the outside or it might look a little bit disorganized or unusual but I always meet deadlines. I always have everything I need all the project, my materials I need, and I know where to find them, and they're organized in such a way that I can find them quickly.

It was really hard to take them. My kids were Are spaced out, so they'd have to be at, like all different places and it was a hard decision to make to pull back. But that's exactly what I did for those years. And then when I decided, when my youngest was in school, that it was time to go back. I had developed, like, nervousness because it had been so long But I threw myself in. I looked myself in the mirror and said, you've got to do this, your kids need the money, and I've been working ever since now, it's been like 17 years.

So in spite of the annoyance, I kind of bottle it up and try not to say anything because I'm appreciative of the other perks that I do have, but it is annoying because it's not, right, it is not right, that he is not doing his part and it is upsetting but I try not. Not to dwell on that. I try to just put my best foot forward in work, and be the best person that I can be. And I think that's basically from my independent upbringing that I learned, you know, basically, your happiness is what you make it to be.

I am a person who typically has to have order to function. I cannot work with a big mess, I just can't do it. I'm super productive, but I have to have kind of a clean slate to mentally process, all the data necessary to do my job. So during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, everything was just a wreck. We I work in the hospitality business and we didn't have any workers for a lot of it. People were very afraid to be on the front lines. No one was compensated any extra. And besides that, there were lots of, like Tech issues that just weren't being resolved because no one was available in the tech department and I myself was allowed to work from home and was trying so hard not to catch the virus that I wasn't going in. Either to try to help up there and because it was such a mess, it really impacted my ability to do my job and it just was so stressful. Finally, I decided I've just got to go up there. I Or the in 95 and of course, immediately was exposed to covid-19. As I knew, I would be by my boss and a closed-door meeting where he was not masked, but I had the mask on and didn't get it at that time. So I just had to clean up and organized to function."

I've worked in a lot of jobs that don't have a lot of guidance. I've worked in a lot of ambiguous environments and I think that's really taught me to be able to analyze a situation. Determine what the problem is and be able to know what to do, without someone telling me what to do, you know, I'll ask for advice, I'll ask for input, and I'm Always happy when I have guidance. But when I put in those ambiguous situations where I have to make decisions quickly, I have to make decisions on my own. I'm really able to do that. I would say my greatest weakness is there's a certain level of impatience that I always like to be doing something I don't like to feel like I'm sitting and doing nothing. And sometimes in a job, you really have to be able to sit back and wait because Times it's better not to act until you have all the relevant information. I am aware of that in myself and because I'm aware of it, I'll often force myself to sit down and often just write myself a note to say this. Needs to get done but it shouldn't be done now because we're waiting on this certain piece of information. So again, I'd say my greatest strength is my ability to take initiative and my greatest weakness is a certain sense of Patients, which I am able to control when needed."

My best friend was always, bringing me homework questions and essays to edit. And I would always help her out with her academic work without asking for anything in return. So I think she would say that I am very compassionate and very generous with my time and always willing to help other people. She would probably describe me as a little bit quiet. I tend to listen more than I speak. I tend to think a lot about what I want to say and I think on top of being quiet, she would describe me as thoughtful. And those two things kind of go together because when I'm being quiet, it's because I'm thinking, I think she would say, I'm very loyal as a friend, when she needs something or she needs me to be there for her. I am there for her, but she would probably also say I'm an introvert. So I'm there for her when needed, but I also spend a lot of time on my own because I am introverted. And I need that time to myself. Otherwise she would probably say also that I'm a very intellectual person. I like to read, I like to play word games, always used to play Scrabble with my best friend, and I always like to analyze things in detail and really understand the root cause of things. And since my friend, and I went to school together, I think she would definitely say that. I'm an intellectual. Person."

So for example, I don't like to have status for the sake of having status if it means I have to do something that's against my own beliefs or that feels like dishonest or wrong to me. So in order to avoid quickly, making a decision that I'll regret I like to sit by myself and write out some bullet points that I want to discuss. It does make me nervous talking about money and negotiating with people about money, I'm able to do it and I'm able to to be assertive when I need to but it helps me a lot to know what is my upper and lower limit. What am I willing to accept and not and having that in my mind before hand makes me I would say calmer in the situation and able to communicate more clearly. As for why, I think I behave this way. I think it's because I'm sort of a very thoughtful and introverted person. And I always like to understand myself and my own reasons for doing things. And when I understand that, I'm always able to negotiate and communicate with others better."

I'm a team and build relationships with them. So in the beginning I'm less concerned about the specifics of my work and about what others think of me. Then about just really relaxing with them and talking and getting to know them. What do they think their strengths are and what do they think their weaknesses are? What is their place on the team? So when I first joined a team. I really try to attend all the team events I tried to participate a lot in any social events but when it comes to meetings, I would say I'm actually very quiet when I'm new on a team because I like to one find my place first and to kind of know the places of the other people on the team. What are they responsible for kind of understand the general expectation. Tations about how to behave in meetings before I really step forward and speak a lot. So, I would say, when I first enter a new team, people tend to think I'm very quiet, and maybe a little shy and then they're honestly surprised when weeks, or months later, I start being very assertive. And it's really because I've spent that initial time building relationships, and getting to know, what is the place where I can be most productive on the team?"

Maybe I have a lot of work to do that day and the person is making some noise or taking up my time when I feel like I don't have a lot of time. So I try to First think what is it about my own life? That may be making me particularly stressed today. And then I also try to think about why is the person acting this way? Is there a reason that they're annoying me that it's you know, they they don't think it's annoying. They're not trying to annoy me. So I really try to see the situation from the other person's Viewpoint as well. What do I usually do in order to solve? The problem is really think of a way. I can communicate to the person that their behavior is annoying me. Maybe, but it's not personal and there's a way that we can solve it, that's going to be positive for both of us. So I would say maybe because I'm an introverted person because I'm an analytic person. And because I tend to be very empathetic, I always tend to step back and sort of look for the root cause of the annoyance rather than immediately blaming the person who is annoying me."

I actually like my workplace to be very organized because I find basically that I can think more clearly when there's not so much clutter around me. It's kind of like, physical clutter ends up, leading, to mental clutter. So, I really try to keep my work place as organized as possible that said, when I've been very, very busy and had tasks that need to be done quickly, And sometimes I haven't been able to put the time into organizing my workspace that I wanted, and I'm actually really able to work in chaos. I have had office mates and housemates who are not organized at all. And I'm able to find my way around a whole lot of clutter, and still get my work done. And I think that's because I am a very focused person, but I really try to avoid that sort of disorganized situation because I find it is really kind of a waste of time. Time and mental energy. I would say that especially I try to keep my desk, clear? So and kind of keep my chaos in a certain place, so if I have something I haven't tried to organize, maybe I'll have a box that has all my disorganized papers, but that box can be shoved under my desk and kind of in that way, shoved out of my brain. So I can continue to think clearly. So that's kind of how I can have a little bit of disorganization in my office while still having an organized in my workspace."

It's just having some without getting into personal information, medication side effects, so it's just temporary. Okay, so what would you consider among your greatest strengths and weaknesses as an employee, my greatest strength overall that I get Complimented on the most frequently or commented on just in general, is that I'm very detail-oriented very attentive towards just details in general. I tend to catch things that most others or all others in a lot of cases would miss or overlooked but it can also be my greatest weakness as well because sometimes I can get hung up on the details. I can get to detail focused. So sometimes I have to overcome that but in general I can pick up on things and transform things from I mean I can turn anything into anything depending on what it is I can like if you give me a task and asked me to be able to turn it into something else, I will strongly be able to do that because I Something else. That is very great strength of Mind, as I'm able to think creatively very well. And I'm also very good at working independently, but also being a leader when it comes to working with a group of others, as well. Very naturally. I just fall into that position. People end up, just looking to me, pretty automatically for the lead on things. And then I also can be very emotionally intelligent, which can be very helpful when working with others through any kind of job whatsoever. So, I guess the flip side of all of those would be possible weakness for me. Sometimes working independently works the best for me and when it comes to working with others working freely with them and working, Like enthusiastically with others in a group setting, it doesn't come as naturally to me as working independently."

And I've always been like that where I don't feel restricted to just people who are in my same age group. I can kind of naturally get along with people of any age and I tend to be just very I think they would describe me as being very creative, very detailed. Very interesting and interested in them like I I think they would say that I'm a very good listener that I'm very compassionate and kind and generous and I think they would just say that in general, they I've always found that my friends find my company to be just different from because I tend to be always different. I'm sure. I also look very different right now. So I tend to be just I stand out and especially when Spending time with friends and they will seek out my company for stuff that. They just wouldn't do more average activities with other people. And with me they would do stuff that they probably wouldn't do with anybody else."

Why do you think that is how I behave in such situations? Is, I tried to just react to the most appropriately and ethically, and with the most Integrity that I can, I just tend to be very true to myself and try to fairly recognize the needs of everybody involved. Evolved and so I will try to be fair to everybody but I will also be very professional above everything else. So if something if a task requires more time than maybe they had anticipated and said that it would if I feel that that is what is required or if it's just an excuse me it had required what they thought would be less time but I thought that it would be helped by spending more time. I'm very willing to do that because I put the needs of what needs to get done above what, people might have normally expected because I can be very detail-oriented and it matters very much to me, to always do a very good job to be very thorough and I just can't walk away from anything that needs to get done, especially in a professional context, where I feel like I didn't do my best or at least very close to it. It sometimes there has to be Mises sometimes, things need to be quicker rather than the best possible way you could have done it. So I find that that can affect how much money I can make. Because the more work I'm generally able to do at a time, the more money I can make from it. But I'm not going to rush or do a bad job, just for the sake of getting closer to making more money because I think that would negatively affect my status over time because if I am rated for, what that job was, I think I would get a lower rating for not doing as well and I will A little bit of what my rating could be as far as status goes. If I feel that the needs of the work have to come first over, always, making sure that I chased the best possible rating each time because there's definitely been lots of times where I feel that a lot of things are where I give my feedback, and a lot of times, I feel that they could use a lot more thorough feedback than maybe they had originally asked for and then ends up being very Very positive towards what I think I can find for them but I do worry sometimes that that might mean they don't expect as much feedback and with, as much detail. So I put the work first"

Why do you think that is? So when I enter a new team, usually, I'm hesitant at first because I want to get the lay of the land. I want to know what the personalities are like with everybody. And how willing everybody is to do the work, especially in the fashion that I feel is at the very least acceptable, but I do prefer people to try to go above and beyond because that's what I do. So how I usually behave is to be more quiet, but by the end, I pretty much always end up leading everybody because people end up looking to me or because I just by default, give my all and try to do my best. I don't know how to step it down. Either the way I feel like other people do. So naturally, I'm very shocked. A lot of times when working with others where I just don't understand why there. Putting in such little effort, I don't feel. It's necessarily a reflection of what they're capable of. It just might be, they have a lack of enthusiasm or they just want to skate by doing the minimum bear effort and I don't function like that. I Just automatically want to do my best because I am so detail-oriented I will notice when things just don't seem to be lining up or working very well. And so it bothers me and I want things to be the best reflection of what I'm capable of and then as part of a team, what we're all capable of together. So, Why I think it is that people end up, looking to me for leadership, why it just ends up happening, naturally, pretty much all the time when being part of a group is because I can just generate a lot of enthusiasm. Because I tend to notice things that other people Overlook, because I just very naturally fall into wanting to do my best and looking at things very thoroughly and I can the catch things that other people miss so that we make sure everything is going to get done the best it can. Okay, so yeah, I think I just end up naturally being in a leadership position, others looking to me for that because it's just naturally how I am."

Why do you think that is in situations when someone annoys me actually, the previous question really comes to mind when I'm working with a team of people and I don't feel they're doing their best, I can get very strongly worded and very strong in my attitude. And because I tend to Sound and look very friendly. I guess people don't necessarily always expect it so I can get some bad reactions, but I don't mind being tough for the sake of making sure everybody excels. And especially if my work is dependent upon their work as well, I'm just not going to accept people giving excuses or just not doing especially an equal or fair amount of work. Compared to what I've done, what others have done. So when somebody annoys me in that context, I will just tell them exactly how I feel about it. I won't accept them trying to insist on having their way when they haven't even been contributing much and people usually putting things off until the last minute. I will do that myself on my own, but I won't do that as part of a group and I don't find it acceptable because you should need to always be aware of. Where everybody's at what? Everybody is contributing. With everybody's capable of. And if that means I have to push other people, then I will absolutely do that because I don't mind providing guidance, even in a more forward way to make sure that we all XL together. And the reason why I think that is why I will try to compensate for things that annoy me and others, is because I don't want my Downfall to be the incompetence of somebody else and because I can just get very defensive about being able to do my best especially if I'm hooked on to having that be weighed down by somebody else, having to do their best in. They're not. So it just really annoys me when people don't give their best and don't Or at least try really hard. And I can't even figure out why whether it's laziness or they just don't take it seriously enough or they just want to get by with a bare minimum. I just don't function like that. I Would have to make a very great effort to do my bare minimum, which I guess is a contradiction, but that's how I am."

Why do you think that is? I tend to pretty much all the time. Not be very organized from an outside perspective. I'm very much one of those people where other people would look at it might work space and think, how do you find anything? But I know where everything is, and I find, it works better for me than having everything be neat and clean and straight lines. All the the time because it doesn't feel as active. It feels more stiff and stale. And I just, I mean, to think of an example, if I'm working on something where I'm writing, everything will just be a disorganized mess until I narrow it down and it gets more and more organized as I go. And then everything gets very neatly put together by the end but with anything where I started project, Or work of any kind, it usually begins as taking everything out. Figuring out how to sort everything and end. I usually make a mess before I need it up and then the end product, you can't even really look back and figure out how that all of it, get down to that. So II tend to not be very organized in my workspace and sometimes not in my work because to me the final product is what really matters and I find it stimulating to know that I don't need to be very careful about where everything is and make sure it's workable for somebody else. As long as it's workable, for me, that means the most important thing to me is being able to do the best work that I can. And however, the means are that I need to get there. I feel the end result is what matters, most and not the way that you get there."

Um, I don't think I've ever really been in a situation like this, but I think that's how I would behave based on have behaved in similar situations and other aspects of life.

It's kind of typical to me to be kind of messy and disorganized but if I'm in like a work situation, I do try to keep everything organized.

I would have to say going along with that, one of my greatest weaknesses would be sometimes. I tend to get a little bit too involved with my projects and I feel as though I need to work on. On them even though when I'm old even though I'm off the clock and I guess you can call that OU campus in a way but um yeah. And I would have to say, I'm also on, you know, very considerate and kind of others, I'm always talking to and then the young a helping hand to others, other coworkers. I'm always on time, I'm always prepared to help others and as I've already mentioned, I mentioned it again because it's something that I really care about is making sure that you know, you work as a team when I'm working with other people and I would have to say another thing that I'm really good at it's just making sure that I get down and prioritize tasks. In order of importance, which I've seen a lot of other fellow employees struggle with the tend to get overwhelmed with how many tests that need to get done. Usually I try to make sure that we're all on the same page if I'm working with the team."

See you thinking about situations where I made a professional decisions that could affect my status or how much money I made. I would have to say there's been situations where I had to either a compromise, my Integrity as a business entity and, you know, just go against the Green of what my company stands for. Or I can continue to prioritize my customers their Dance. And make sure that I follow the principles that were set in stone. When I first found the my company. And the way that I behaved in situations, I always make sure that I stopped to my core beliefs that I always stood behind in regards to a my company stands for and what I stand for, as the, the owner of the company that runs everything. I've always made sure that I prioritize my companies and the reason why I did that was because I feel as though it's really important to stay true to who you say you are. And I think your business really should represent your core values and when you stand behind I think that your business and the work that you do should be very solid and he's a solid foundation and I would have to say that's the main reason why I've always stood behind.

So you're thinking about a situation in which I joined a new team of people and how I reacted I would have to say the main thing was more. The main thing is, is that when I joined a new team, I always make sure that everybody felt You know, felt as though I was a team player because that's really what I am. And I always made sure that I told everybody, you know, who I am, what I stand for, but I always made sure that I'm, you know, I was always very accommodating so that I fit in, I think it's really important to be a team player, so I always stress that, you know, I'm there for them. And you know, hopefully they are there for me as well. So that's the main thing. In regards to, you know, me joining a new group or team of people. So I always try to fit in I think it's a bad idea to be too individualistic when working with the team because usually when you're working with a team it's the bigger picture that's always a priority. It's you know, what is the big picture? What is the goal with? Everybody's trying to accomplish. So for me, always try to blend in with the group rather and you know, be more individualistic. And um yeah and the reason for that again is because I think it's really important to be a team player, it's essential. If you want your company and any projects you're involved in to be successful,"

So thinking about situations in which somebody annoyed me and you know, how I reacted in such situations, I would have to say just in situations in which we are working on a group project and somebody wanted to go off and do their own thing. And you really wanted to change your direction in a project when we were looking to close up and I'll, you know, wrap up the project that we were working on and on. Usually when a situation like that arises, I just try to convince them to, you know, focus on the big picture which is finalizing and yeah, pretty much completing your project. So you know, I talked him down from you know, whatever ideas that they have that I know and everybody else knows won't work and the reason why I do that is because it's more important. To complete a project and make sure that everything is done as you leave it out originally before you even started the project because a lot of times projects tend to get, you know, off track and not complete it because people attend to while we lose track of the big picture. So yeah for me it's just all about getting the project done and making sure that everything is success. And staying true to the plan that we laid out prior to starting the project."

So thinking about situations in which my work or workplace was not very organized, I would have to say there were situations in which I would go on vacation or you know I was sick and out of work for some time and I would come back and D moved. My my regular I guess you can call it like a room, but it's not really like a room sick. I am more or less like a desk area or my computer is, and the table is next to the conference area and usually, they would put me at a spot where everything was really messy because it was a spot where nobody was really sitting. It was occupied by anyone at the company. People would just put all their papers, their, you know, whatever else that you may be working on with end up there. So usually what would happen in the situations when the work, my work area because it still is my work area is pretty messy. I would usually just try to get everything cleaned up and organized again. And I would set aside some time if it was really messy, I would just set aside like an hour every day that I was there to really clean up and make sure everything is taken care of that way. Everything is organized and it's not very typical of me with some not so many. That usually takes a lot of brakes don't work and regards to my own work table that I usually work at. If it gets messy. It's usually because I'm really working hard at a project and I still set aside at least an hour to clean, you know, one some Thunder project but it's not very typical of me at all."

I can also take on solo projects, just fine. I don't, I am very accommodating. I am optimistic. Very truthful, very friendly, very helpful. I put the needs of others before myself. I am very skilled at many different forms of technology. Be it Microsoft Office program to our programs web design UI design. Ux If I have any weakness, it would be that, I tend to take charge more than I should. I don't give people much of a chance.Doing things, if somebody messes something up, instead of having them fix it, I usually just take it into my own hands to make it better, but I'm working on, improving, on that. And because because I realized that if I solve people's problems, they're not going to learn Whereas, if they learned sell their own problem, it won't happen again."

My best friend would describe me as cheerful optimistic easygoing, very relaxed, hard-working diligent Determined very determined stubborn at times. Very friendly, very helpful, but not a pushover. She would say that I always there, if she says that she needs help, I'm there at the drop of a hat. Oh I if if she needs a ride to the airport, I will be late to work to get her to the airport type thing. She would probably say that I kind of go to my way too much to help others. But overall. I'm just a very friendly person."

Basically, I was given a lot of problems to solve. And I don't, I never really considered that this would affect my my wages or my how people viewed me. Because honestly, I don't really care how people view me. I just if there's a problem that needs to be solved, I solve it and, I think that's because I really I really don't. Mind what people think of me. I try to be a good person and it's all I can really expect from now if I'm a good person, people might think think that of me and that's all I can really ask. I don't need the whole world to like me so I don't focus on On how this way, you know, could go wrong. I just, I tried to find the solution and work on that because that's what matters, more than popularity."

I just kind of like blend into the background and just observe, you know, who these people are how they're interacting with each other, get a feel for this for whatever is going on. And it takes a little bit of time. Not too tired too long, but I'll warm up to people. But, um, At first, I am very, very shy and quiet and it does take me a bit of time because I don't want to make things awkward. It's awkward enough because there's, you know, they're new to me. So I'm new to them now and I feel like they should Feel comfortable around each other and then let me blunt start to blend into their group."

It kind of numb me to anybody who's really annoying. I'd have to say if there was somebody annoying. It's usually not to me and but if I'm in the general area of a not knowing person, like if I'm in the supermarket and there's a screaming kid, I will try to stay on the other side store. I don't. I don't like being around annoying people and I also don't want to confront them and I'm very confrontational person so it's my best tactic is to avoid them. If somebody was annoying to me, I would probably like to my face, I would probably just Excuse myself and wander away. Because again, I try to avoid confrontation."

My room my house. It's, it's not perfect perfect. It's not extremely highly organized, but there's a place for things and things in their rough proper places. It's not typical for me to have a lot of just clutter everywhere, it might look it, if you can look in the background, but everything has its own place. and if anything is not organized, it means that I obviously haven't been around to organize it,"

It. Also, I'm just a really good mediator overall, so I'm just very helpful in those ways and I just think that that's a great strength of mine or weakness is sometimes, you know, I find it hard to ask for help myself. And so, a lot of times I just end up wasting more time trying to find my own Solutions or like researching it myself or Googling. It and so I end up spending a lot of time that way. So I've tried to like, you know, work on that by you know, if I'm new to the job or new out of place or something like that, I try to You know. Get to know like at least one person or trainer or something like that so that I can get comfortable. Like asking so comfortable asking them a question? if I get confused or anything like that, or if I need help,"

Like, I would say that about myself but I think they would also say that as well. That my personality is really surprisingly funny and interesting that I do care. A lot about people. I just have a strange way of showing it. that I think they would also say in general that I tend to be Too invested in things sometimes or over critical as well, that I can be negative but I can also be positive. So it's a lot of contradicting as well. I think they would also say that typically, I'm pretty quiet like, overall, I'm pretty quiet."

Usually I do have the tendency to start something and not finish it or quickly get bored and stuff like that. In general, it's just because I haven't found something that I'm interested in this program that I have joined. Like, I really do feel invested interested, I feel like it's going somewhere so now I feel like a shift has happened and all of that. So It's not the typical reaction that I usually have to stuff like this. So to me I'm like I'm ready to, you know, make the change and make this difference."

So the last time I joined a new team of people was when I started a new job and a new training class. I usually Behave quiet. I kind of observe I'm really observant. So I kind of have the tendency to just kind of see who is also quiet. Kind of notice the different personalities and stuff like that. To know who would be okay to talk to who would not be okay for me to talk to just, you know, I know that my personality is more Melo overall and so someone else that's really like dominant. Like my personality will not mesh well because I feel like they're going to control me until I don't want to be controlled or told what to do. So it's just kind of like you do your thing. I'm going to do my thing, but why do I think I could do that? It's just, I think it's just based off of that. Like I just feel like everyone should Free to make their own decisions and someone shouldn't be, you know, just because they're louder than someone else. They're forced clicking for someone else to make decisions that they don't want to make, or they force them to do things. They don't want to do just because you have more of a outgoing personality or more forceful personality. So it's just I guess maybe it's to protect myself."

I just, I don't understand why people are so selfish on the road. Why we can't just share the road, like, you know, if you needed to get to work early, why didn't you leave the house early? Like I just have these questions that now I have to pay for the fact that you decided to wake up late, leave late and now I have to be behind you or slow down so you can get in front of me when it's like, if you just left on time, we all could just drive normal now, we're all driving crazy or everyone's driving crazy. And it doesn't have to be that way. How do you usually react in such situations? I have the tendency to get I guess, angry annoyed, frustrated, sad, and that just ends me at said, like, after I feel all those emotions, I just get sad because now, I'm like, how did this happen? Like, why are we here? Like, why, how did we get here? Because you woke up late, that's how we got here. And to me, I'm like, this is a silly reason that we got here. Now, I'm sad because you woke up late. That's wild to me. Why do I think that is? I just think that, you know, I think that we do. Think about how our decisions affect others. I think we just think about ourselves and we just say, oh, if I'm late and I just cut someone off, it doesn't make a difference and it makes a huge difference because I left on time and I was going to be on time. But now all these people, 10 people, 20 people, 30 people who are late that are now jumping in front of me. Now, I'm late. So, it's just kind of like to me is a trickle-down effect that people don't think about each. Other if we thought about each other more, I would be sad less. So, you know, I would appreciate that."

I usually do have time and so I had just started this program. I just started the training class and so I didn't really have a lot of time. And so, a lot of things were not organized and I just, I'm pretty, that's not typical of me. I'm pretty decently neat and decently organized. But why do you think that is? Why do I think that is? I'm just also, I'm decently organized, but I don't have the best time management. So even though I was just reacted in tired from the course, and from the training, I still didn't manage enough time to just just, you know, keep myself organized and find a way to stay organized on top of that. So that caused my work area to be not very organized."

I am very good about working with a variety of different people and I really enjoy it. I believe in the concept of synergy that we all work together to make better, something better than were capable of making on our own. And I'm very good about Being accepting and tolerant of different personality types and working with people who maybe don't think exactly how I do or come from a different background, able to meet people where they are. And I'd say that tends to be my biggest strength on the flip side of that. I think my biggest weakness would be that I can be a little bit of a people pleaser. That's something I've always struggled with, I'm a very laid-back and Cooperative person. But the - to that, Isn't times. I do fall into that people-pleasing mode and I've got to work on that over the years and I've gotten a lot better at it. And now if confrontation is necessary, I can do it and I will address any issues that need to be addressed, but that is something that I always have to push myself to do. So, that's probably my biggest weakness, but I have definitely worked on that. So overall, they consider my basic personality type, I think is a strength for the workplace."

I think that I'm usually that kind of person for most of my friends, they can come and talk to me about anything and I know that I won't judge them and I'll do whatever I can to help them out. So I think that would be probably the number one thing I think. Most friends would also say I'm kind of introverted but a lot of fun. I do very social but I also do like my alone time so I do I'm the kind of person you can call go out and have a very relaxed night and you know, have a good time but also keep it kind of chill. I think that's how they would describe me."

And one example would be, I used to work as a personal trainer where you're pretty much always selling yourself and so on your services, but I didn't really think of it that way. If I had an orientation with a potential new client, I didn't think how can I make the most money off of this person? It was more, how can I help this person and how can I My show them what my training services can do for them. So I think if you focus on doing a good job and doing right by the people around you eventually the money will end up following. So I just try to focus on doing the best that I can."

So I really like to get to know everybody and in terms of job performance, I think it's good to get to know people and figure out what everybody's strengths and weaknesses are and then how I fit into that. So joining a new team, especially professionally, my first goal, I think, would be to figure out what my expectations are and what my job performance is expected to be, and then look at the team around me and see how I feel. Fit in with that. And I think I'm like that because I mentioned earlier, I'm pretty Cooperative person. I'm a team player, so I feel like it's about the team, getting the job done. It's not just me and what I'm there to do, it's what we're all there to do."

It takes a lot to really irritate me, guess anytime. I know in the workplace anytime I have been annoyed it's when I felt like somebody was interfering with me doing my job, right? Or the way that I wanted to do it. That's the kind of thing that frustrates me. I think when when there's a lot of red tape, I'm not a big fan if I'm with going through the process and You know, working respecting the rules of the organization, but I really get irritated when there's unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy that just hinders us from getting our job done. That's the kind of thing that irritates me. So in situations like that, I've just talked to my boss about it, or co-workers and said noose, why? I think we should do it this way. And this is how the way we do things now is holding me back and usually people are pretty receptive to that if you just talked about it. So that's usually how it would respond to that."

And so I just kind of have to figure out how I fit into all that and how I could not only learn my new job but also help keep things as organized as possible. So, yeah, I would definitely say. I'm one of the people who wants to get things back on track, if things are disorganized."

I usually excuse me, I usually behave in a very cautious but attentive manner. So I'm going to want to go ahead and gather as much research as possible to help me make the best informed decision that could lead to the better status outcome or improving my pay grade, so to speak. So I think that is just a typical human evolutionary trait, everybody. I think wants to see some sort of progress in their life, whether that progress be at your job or anything else like that for me, personally, it certainly is my job and how much money I make. So, you know, I take those things, very seriously. So I would definitely put a lot of thought that tension and hard work into making sure that I make the best professional decisions possible to affect that."

Some groups are a little more lively than others. Some people tend to have like a one leader aspect. The rules, the group others tend to share it, more of like a democracy. So, you know, I kind of me trying to feel out the group dynamics as well as the members on it before I start really adding my two cents into it. So much so to speak. And I think that's just, you know, an air of caution on my side because I don't want anything to be abrasive or, you know, difficult for anybody to get along. I'm trying to find out the way to make the smoothest and best atmosphere for everybody around and what's the most efficient way that we can all work together. So I think it stems from a place subjective preferences as well as objective in this. Sense of efficiency."

So in a professional setting, if someone is annoying me, nine times out of 10, at the very least, I would say I'm going to ignore that person. I'm going to try and rectify the situation of course, but if that situation cannot be rectified in this person is still continuing to annoy me. I would just simply again, attempt to ignore them and move on with my day and hopes that they would eventually get tired of lugging me and move on with theirs as well. I think that I I take that approach because I don't really care to get into any kind of arguments or anything at a professional level. It just doesn't look good for you or the company and there's really no positive outcome that can come from that. So the best thing to do is just move on with your day, you know, there's no reason to engage that sort of behavior with anyone else and and stoop yourself to that level. So I think that's why I behaved that way."
5a9416ba6475f900019fa690_q6_c1_1672249321_9397128d-c872-4f79-b0ed-043001ac6139,"I guess I'm a little bit confused about this question because it says, think of situations when your work or work space. We're not very organized. How typical is that of you? I don't know if they're trying to insinuate here, that it's me. That's not keeping the works, Place. Workplace, that excuse me, workspace, clean, or if it's someone else that's left at that way for me. But for me, personally, that's not typical. I like to keep my workspace area as clean as possible. I've got my Necessities nearby of course, but I don't want to have a bunch of clutter in the way. And that's just purely for efficiency sake. If I have a bunch of excuse me, a bunch of things in the way I'm going to have to keep clearing everything out and try and find whatever it is, I'm looking for. Whereas if it's already clean organized, I'm not going to have to spend so much time, looking for whatever it is that I need because it's going to be pretty apparent, it'll be right there. So it is an efficiency thing and I just seem to have you know, a personal preference and makes me feel better to be efficient. So those two work in tandem Adam. And I think that's why I behaved that way and why it is that way."

So I think that would be one of my weaknesses strengths. I could be a good leader when I need to be and I think that I can help run a team smoothly as I have been somewhat of a lead. Lead at one of my old jobs. I was kind of like right under management. So I think moving up to the next step would be a very good idea. Are step up and a career for me.
5a95fee189de8200013eddd4_q2_c1_1672764646_8bc859f9-5035-4398-a862-2e64b5dda4a4,"I think my friends would typically describe me as an honest, hard-working easy to get along with lawyer loyal, trustworthy person. If I say I'm going to be somewhere to help you. I'm there if you need me and I'm not in the middle of something important. I will drop what I'm doing to come help you. I'm always there to listen. Didn't I? My friends would think of me as what you wanted, a friend, everything you need. So which you would need to turn that over to a management position because you need a lot of those same things as a manager."

Is I was slowly like under management and my, I just had a baby and he was growing up and I really wanted to be there. So I decided because they didn't understand that, I need it to be a mom. They wanted me to be just a manager, and not just Mom, I stepped down so that I could be what I needed to be. So that was a lack of money because we're not really, cuz I got to keep my pay, but that could have cost me. To change my pay. I think another situation would probably be. when I was asked to move up to that position, I guess would be a better situation and then I did get a raise with it and keys and you know, coach the store"

I know that's not really my team, but it is because they're the ones I have to. Work with are even, I guess the people that actually work at the school of himself. No, get to know the manager thought managers principles, Vice principals and they know who you are and you do you work with them to be able to do a good job as a sub?

But I was working as a cashier and we customer wanted to know, She's not as cashier at the copy center and the customer wanted to know how much it was to ship for UPS, which is what we offered. So I let her know when she didn't like the price. And so, then she said, well, what do you think would be at the post office? And that was like, ma'am. I don't know, I don't work at the post office. Won't you can't even give me a rough estimate? No, ma'am, I don't work. At the post office, I don't know, their prices. And she got really upset with me because I wouldn't answer her question. But I have no way of knowing if it would be cheaper at the post office, I didn't work at the post office. She wasn't. She wanted to speak to a manager."

So I'm usually why I'm working pretty organized and try to keep my desk at least organized. Even if the rest of my house, this is always nice. There's something you'd like to add. Not really. I mean, excuse me, it's not typical for me to be unorganized when I'm working. So, I tend to keep it as organized as possible."

I feel that it's a responsibility to being dedicated. I got the job for a reason and I need to do my job because typically, if, if you don't do your job then it looks It looks bad on you and I don't want anybody to think that I'm doing a bad job or that I'm not a good employee. I feel that some of my greatest strengths are also. Some of my weaknesses tend to be too focused on detail. I want everything to look to look the right way to look the way it's supposed to. I don't want to steer clear from what policy states. I don't want to. I don't want to go to off track from that but then that tends to also be a weakness because sometimes you're not going to be able to get it the way that that you want it to be and you might Focus too much on it and then you are going to be lacking in another area where you could have spent more time, you could have spent the right amount of time doing the one thing and then you would have time left over to do the next project. But if you spend too much time, focusing on the little fine details of their first project then, You're going to have less time to work on your second project. And due to that I also feel like like I do tend to be a perfectionist. So but that follows a line of what I would just explaining that that's a strength and a weakness but another strength that I would have is my communication skills. I feel that. I'm that I do a great job communicating but I feel like those are some of my strengths and my weaknesses."

If it's something to do with their job, if it's something to do with school, if it's something to do with just life, in general, typically I'm there for him and and given situation, I would say that they would describe me. As being honest, I try to be honest with Them. I never want to keep anything from them. I want them to know how I feel. I never want them to think that I'm like trying to stab them in the back or trying to get one up on them. I never want them to feel that way. I tend to be very open and I feel that because I am that. My best friend is very open with me so that helps us to have a very good relationship. I feel like they would describe me as Having Integrity because I do try to and I feel like that shows through my actions and I feel like that they would describe me that way.

I work there for about two months as part time and because of my background and and what I did in school and and from what I worked while I was in school, I was able to I applied to be a manager and, and because of all the almighty what I've done in the past, I was able to become a manager there at the place that I'm working on now, and I feel like this is Justin as helped me greatly especially with with how much money I'm making.

It was it felt awkward at first because I was coming in and I was basically on a new boss and I've never met these people before. They didn't know anything about them, they didn't know anything about me. So it was just weird coming in as being their boss. Boss. And and then now I'm having to tell them what to do and they have no idea who I am and it was just It felt weird but after after a little while, it does take getting to know people and asking questions just getting along with them and definitely, this was a situation that I had. Whenever I took the job I never really thought about it. So and then after getting in this and my position, It's just shown me of what I can do and how others view me and treat me. It's the seems like they treat me very highly and they and they respect me. So I definitely I definitely find that on very Very rewarding."

When someone is annoying me again, is that work there is this one customer who comes in almost every day and And it's not so much that they complain, they really don't. It's just that they want to come in and they just want to talk. All like, basically they want to talk for hours. And typically that that would be fine if I wasn't at work. But I am a I'm at work, I'm trying to get things done and it's just, I just find it annoying that that people just want to talk about it. So, in these, this type of situation I usually try to find a point where I can tell them like like that. That's great. But I've got to get back to what I'm doing. And I just, I guess the reason why I think it it's annoying is that is that they know that I'm at work. And then I'm trying to do things. I'm trying to get stuff done and they just want to talk, I guess that's why I find it annoying."

I like to keep things clean and but at work my my desk is not just my desk. It's um it's a my whole departments desk and it's during the day it gets very busy and stuff just gets thrown on the desk. Like I said, I work at Menards and it's like things front of the Departments will get thrown on the desk that we have to put back later. Just paperwork in general I try to keep things organized but My my manager and our assistant manager, they tend to not keep things organized. As I would like, I'm, I know, I guess your day, the desk was very messy in it and I spent probably 20 minutes of my day just organizing getting things in the right spot and I am And because if it's in the right spot and everybody knows where it is, it's a very accessible.

So when I'm the new person, I feel a certain pressure to do things. Almost perfectly to do the right thing at all times. And I typically do get the job done and I typically don't have any problems. And I feel like it's normal for people to notice that because they're used to things happening a certain way.

I am honest even when it involves admitting my fault and my mistakes and I will never compromise that at the expense of another person. One of my weaknesses.

Once was out at a brewery with a friend and purchased some beer to go, they had a bunch of overstocked beer in built up into a pyramid by the door. Told the server that I was interested in purchasing a case to take home on my way out. I grabbed my to what I thought were half cases and got home. By the time I got one. I got home to put the beer in the fridge. I realized that each box was actually a case in itself and not a half case. So I'd accidentally taken an extra case. My friends were shocked and surprised when I called the brewery and ask them to charge my credit card for an additional case of beer. Even the hostess that answered, the phone was a little surprised that I had called and been asked asked to be charged for an extra case of beer. It was an honest mistake. I wanted to make it right and didn't want the thought and the guilt of taking an extra case, hanging on my conscience."

People in my industry, people in my family people who would also be affected by my decision, my wife, and I took all of the all of the evidence, all the information that I was given and I put it into positive and negative, just a simple T chart with positives on one side and negatives on the other. I looked at what I stood to gain, what I stood to lose. And I made my decision from there. I like to make my decisions based on facts based on that evidence and logic. And I think that that is the best way to drive a decision. I think a lot of times people get bogged down with their emotions and with their thoughts and their feelings. And I think that that can Cloud your judgment when making important decisions based on your future. That's who I am as a person.

So I like to learn more about people's interest, what they do outside of work for fun, their hobbies and I shared that same information with others. I like to try and build connections, relate to people and find common interests.

This question and my answer to this has changed throughout the years. I think the younger more immature me would have handled things a little differently. Probably not as productively or as positively as the more wise, current me would younger me. I think would have kind of pushed back a little Lil Bit and tried to be annoying myself, equally annoying or treated them differently. To let them know that I was perturbed or angered with them. I think I'm at a point now in my career and in my life where stuff like that isn't really important to me, I think I've learned that you can deal with anything. Things are usually just on a temporary basis. Even if it's, you know, a one year project that I'm working on with something that I find annoying or don't really click with my current way of dealing with that is to find the best in the person.

I've got my second tier problem pile, and then I've got my stuff that can be put off and I'm constantly working off. Those piles to me. It makes sense. I know where everything is. In is I know what needs to be done. First, and know what can wait. I know what something that I can get to in the future. And so, while it might look disorganized on the surface to me, it actually looks and feels very organized because it's what I've worked under for the last 10 years.

I make professional decisions that affect my personal status and how much money I make generally. I am going to focus on the good of the team that more so than the good of myself. So if I'm making a professional decision that involves say throwing my team members under the bus, in order to get a greater benefit for myself, that really doesn't interest me. I really I can't live with the guilt of knowing that I've been only out for myself. I'm not a selfish person so I will make decisions on a professional level that are the greatest benefit to everybody. For example if my team could get if we could all get a 5% raise or I personally could just get a 20% raise, I'm going to err on the side which running over 5% raise and the reason of that is because I feel that everyone deserves to be acknowledged for their hard work."

Feel for how a team that's been assembled and working together, how well they've gel, how they gelled, how they have found teamwork to be most beneficial to them before.

This kind of ties back to my answer to the earlier question about my weakness and that's that I don't deal. Well with interruptions. So I've had co-workers in the past who just stand in my office and talk when I'm clearly trying to get work done. And I try to be polite and it's important to me to show respect to that person because I don't think on a professional level, they're doing anything intentionally to be annoying.

It's not really typical. Of me to have a disorganized workspace. I don't think. Well, when there's a lot of clutter around me, I like things to be organized. I like things to be in their place and I like to be able to know exactly where to find a pen, or a highlighter or that report I was working on. So, it's even important for me to have my computer desktop organized. And that's because that keeps me more focused. That keeps me calmer and it helps alleviate any anxiety that I might have.

I would say, one of my weaknesses is wanting to Be overly independent. I really like to work by myself if I have the choice and I think I could probably improve a bit by making sure that I interact with others and really let them be a part of my decision and planning processes so that together we can move our company or team forward.

Why do I think that is? I think in situations such as this. I'm the type of person that will take probably a little longer than others, to make a decision. I like to make sure I have all the facts Acts that I could possibly gather whether that's from my own independent research or if that's from talking and discussing things with others. And I think that's because I want to avoid disappointment. I want to avoid failure. I'm okay with taking risks but kind of the type of person who wants to err on the side of caution.

Even if that involves you know hanging out with them outside of work getting to see kind of not just what type of person they are in a working environment but also what type of person they are day-to-day and When they're away from work, I can be a little bit shy and timid but it depends on the situation if I'm put in charge of people as a manager and put in front of a group of new people, then I'm going to be the one kind of leading the discussion and letting everyone get to know each other. If I'm one of the people that is kind of down low, I might you know kind of observe things first before, you know, raising my voice. Really reaching out to others. And I think that's just because of, you know, expectations and my comfort levels if I'm managing people, then it's my job to kind of coordinate and be outgoing and outspoken.

Sometimes they'll be people driving in a way that I don't think is safe or I think is causing issues one. Such example would be when merging onto the highway when there's traffic people should alternate and take turns turns like a zipper and that makes it better for everyone. However, there's always that person who isn't going to let somebody in or who's going to cut in at the very last minute and is just overall, you know, being very selfish. And I think it annoys me because it's not just affecting me, it's affecting everyone, and I just think they're being ignorant and rude in a situation where we're a society or community. We're all trying to get someplace, no one is more important than anyone else. So if everyone just pays attention in uses courtesy as needed, then everyone could be happy. It only takes, you know, one or two people to really spoil it for everybody else."

Some might even describe me as a bit OCD, where everything has its place, and I think the organization helps me, be a more effective leader because I know where everything is and having a clean death. Ask means I have a clean mind. I can think more clearly. Sometimes the work itself could be not very organized and that's just how it is. So I don't let it stress me out too much, please things outside of my control. So again in order to probably gain some control over things, I can't control, I can focus on things like keeping my desk organized in my space, clean and orderly."

Where that's an option, entry-level rarely has any leverage to argue for higher amounts. I think that is due to personality characteristics that go for higher roles for compensation can be Adjusted."

How do you usually react in such situations? if someone were to annoy me, I would pause and Hope that that moment passed because ultimately due to being a observant person, I would expect that others behavior is outside of my control. So typically if someone were annoying me I would pause and wait for that moment to pass. Another person is only capable of being annoying for a definite amount of time before they start enjoying themselves. So I would therefore wait for that moment to pass before moving on. In general, I'm of the opinion that if you react too strongly to a situation like that it reflects poorly on you. So the correct approach is to wait for that to pass. And then proceed with what you were already trying to do."

More space, got got what was important identified and what wasn't important Aunt was removed. I really personally don't like a lot of clutter and disorganization. That's not needed. There is some need sometimes for Flutter, if you're in a technical field and you got leftover equipment, you know, you can have it organized and it's excess that you may need. But you got to make the decision periodically to remove it. I You know, if I'm in a disorganized area, I'm going to try to organize to the best of my ability."

I learn best by being shown how to do it and then doing it with like supervision and didn't doing it for myself. Now, I can learn things quickly outweigh my weakness. I'm not too sure about my weakness. Probably. Sometimes I do my work too quickly, even though I know how to like do it like quickly, I do it sometimes. I can do it too quickly where it adds more work for myself afterwards because I get added other people's stuff. Yeah."

Other times I just annoyed and go about my day. It depends on like how annoying it is and if they're how close they are to me. Why do I think that is?

For me, I tend to keep my workspaces organized with places I have on my desk. One side will be for like, usually, a lot of side will be like, where I keep my backpack, or my extra work laptop, because sometimes we have to, like, computers for work, and I'll keep the laptop on the other side. So it's not in the way. And then usual on the right side, I have like my little office organizer. What? The little drawers where I keep my pencil cup. My sticky note. Pad my calculator if I need one, my notebook and my pencils.

Basically running a small tap room because the owners didn't know how it was. No. So I jumped in and started doing it, I loved it.

Do my own thing do as much as I could and just know like as soon as the ships over this isn't going to affect my life at all. So you know not take it too seriously basically as long as I'm doing my job in both the people are, then it's fine and it's not my responsibility to be annoyed and tell them what to do.

Especially if I come into a new place and it's just a shared mess, I will just slowly start doing my own thing and organizing it how I want as long as everyone's okay with it.

Well with a group I can also work well by myself and just depends on what kind of job it is or what kind of project needs to be done but I can do both very easily and without any issue and also well then looking at one of my weaknesses is sometimes I find it hard to say no especially to, you know, co-workers who have helped me out in the past. I don't like to let them down. So if the, if I am asked for help, I want to tell them. Yes, I'll help them. But sometimes that comes to my own detriment where, you know, I have too many things on my own, but I'm dealing with and I'm juggling.

For the first time, I really liked it to try to get a bonding with my team as soon as possible. This could be me being humorous, or me connecting on different levels. I think like to find common ground with them. And once you find common ground, we can pretty much do everything anything that together. I know that it's Unique.

So, if you're learning about that, you learn how to work with them and how to be attentive to their needs. And I think that's important too. To be an environment where you're definitely going to have to collaborate with a variety of people, a weakness. That I would say that I continuously try to work on a weakness, maybe just not being so overly Perfection oriented because I think if you do that, or if I do that, you know, I might miss the big picture on something. So, it's, it's always great to, you know, worry about the details. But if I'm overly focused on being a perfectionist, you know, I might miss something. That, you know, really takes away from the big picture. If you're trying to solve a problem or bring something out into into the world, a big project that, you know, that's time-sensitive.

So I think I bring that out. To, I would say long-term people, I would consider very close friends. Yeah. That that would be typically how they would describe me, definitely as somebody that they can, they again? Like I said, they don't have to put on a performance, they can definitely be themselves. They can confide, they don't have to worry about, you know, They tell something that maybe I'm a costume, going to cost up to somebody else. That's not who I see myself as and I definitely believe my longest closest friends would say the same thing. So I think that makes me also trustworthy and their eyes as well."

Well, I would say I've definitely have a career history where professional decisions that affect how much money I've made. They've they've tended or geared towards a more humbling attribute of myself because the decisions I've made an in that respect may have reduced the Income significantly and in some instances that is a good thing because it the decision was made to to perhaps what I would say to build experience in a skill or ability that I didn't have or that, you know, I would get a lot of experience in such as say, a Public Presentation. That's something that is not necessarily. Naturally to me. So if I have an opportunity or in this sense, I did have an opportunity to do it on a regular basis which I think helped me improve when I'm face-to-face making a presentation to a group of people about a product or service. So initially doing something like that or something that that I what I did in the past, making that decision to take that opportunity which Initially lowered, my income. Again, that was a very humbling experience but at the same time, it gave me an opportunity to build on skills that I that I believed long term would be beneficial. So that's that, that is an example of how a professional decision in that scenario. Help me make a little less money. But build a different skill set for myself."

So I think it just lends to me being very, very friendly and kind and just willingness to know as much about others as they're willing to tell again. I think doing that just makes the environment. Isn't it kind of breaks the ice automatically and makes the environment more comfortable and you know everybody then tends to be more willing to take on challenges and feel good about themselves. And one thing's for sure, if most people are all people in the new team, really feel good about themselves. And just, you know, like the camaraderie of meeting new people, it's also have me helps to, you know, stir up ideas and feedback. Feel good about what you can bring to the table. So, yeah, it's definitely being really, really friendly kind and just attentive to like, learning about other people, and how you're going to work well together."

I don't really think a lot of people annoy me because, again, I try to be attentive to her personality traits and, you know, see how, how if people are maybe more aggressive or more passive and try my best. To work around that because it's important to collaborate with others, you know, to solve problems. So, and I generally like Pleasant situations, but if that doesn't happen, generally, I'm more of a quiet person. And I look for cues in their language on maybe what's really wrong, and maybe just inquire a little bit more about what the issue is. And I think the Never voice used helps in that manner because they kind of realized that nothing about me is like an opposition to them. Because again I I always want to be in a situation where there's camaraderie and collaboration so that way you can solve problems and you need more creative that way. So definitely I think I always look for D escalation and Check my tone. So that way, they know, I'm really actually a safe person.

In person, I find that most organization takes place virtual digitally, I should say on the computer. And that's why it's important to be organized via your email because so much takes place in terms of communication. Ian and certain projects attachments, PDFs. So, yes, it's very important and I find that I attend to know at least how to organize folders that way. But in your physical space, in terms of documentation, I don't like clutter in the office in my space. I like to have a reason for having things in a certain way and generally, you know, if I need to leave things out, you know, sir. And documents that are okay, that there's nothing security wise that they should be hidden. They generally are there for a reason, for a particular amount of time. So I don't keep things lingering if I'm not there or if I'm actually finished with what I do. So generally again the majority of work is more digital so it's mostly emails or documentation via PDFs for example but if If it's a paper then it the one it's just not just sort of all over the place. It's in a particular place and it's there for a reason and particularly for maybe a short period of time."

So Normally, I tend to be punctual I love showing up on time, tenacious. I see what the goal is and execute steps in order to meet the goal. I'm focused and driven on the go. And diligent my weaknesses are that, sometimes I care too much. Sometimes I dive too deep into whatever project come on and it is all consuming. And I have a strong desire for everything to be Right, when I submit work, I don't like making mistakes. And, and, and work that I submit to the company that I'm working for ya. I think that answers the question."

Okay, so I think that my best friend would describe me as loyal. Funny. Patient. Forgiving. Focused and empathetic. Loyal. Because I'd like to stick it out through the tough times and the good times, the bad times, whatever. The times, I like having a few relationships, but very strong relationships. And then the next one, funny because I had to crack jokes. I don't like an environment. That's to stiffness to like her. And then patient. Because sometimes, you know, sometimes I have to give myself patience and learning a new thing, a new task. And sometime I have to give the people around me patients, when they're learning something as well. And they pretty much the same for forgiveness and focused. Meaning that if I have a task, if I ever have a goal, I'm very driven and focused on meeting that goal. And also empathetic was the last one. I'm just able to put myself in another person's shoes, to see how they feel and see how they would perceive life."

How do you usually behave in such a certain situations? And why do you think that is? Okay. so I'm thinking of the time when when I was at one particular company and I was there several months and I decided to ask for a raise so I came in I before then I had prepared like a list, it was a sales position and I came in with a list of the silver they were making before I got there and the seals that I was making whilst being employed there and it was a detailed list of different metrics that I meant and how several weeks in a row, I was in the top five and also mention that That the the overall morale of the company was boosted because I would be like everybody's personal, Sheila cheerleader, keeping every yeah keeping everybody going okay. And Why do you think that is? Yeah, cuz I'm I've Seen in the past that in other other positions, I shied away from talking about money, or asking for raises. So I sought out courses and trainings to assist me and being more confident in speaking about money. So it was a lot of personal development. A lot of reading integration things like that in order for me to show freely Make decisions about the money that I make."

Why do you think that is? So normally when I enter a new team of people normally introduce myself, okay? And I like to get to know all the people on my team if possible if it's a smaller team and I like to see if there are any commonalities or differences and I like to talk about those commonalities and differences very briefly during the introduction just to build camaraderie and normally From there as the day progresses, I'll be invited to like lunch and that would be the time for us to get to know each other a little bit better. In the past I've tried hiding. I've tried avoiding the fact that I'm new or anything like that, but I think that in the past that has been my downfall, because I want to be standoffish and I can keep to myself. So I really examine that and I retrain my brain for a confidence. To know that. Okay, I'm meeting new people and it's fun to do new things. And I realize that it doesn't help me to help help. The company doesn't help the team that I'm working with. So, I think that opening up a bit, really has helped. And I've done that by self examining and always improving."

Okay. Normally, I tend to ignore annoying things that happen at work because I know I have control over myself. I don't have control over other people, so normally I just ignore it, but sometimes it is like, sometimes it's not necessary to address the situation because it just works itself out. But if I do choose to respond, I look at it from empathetic standpoint and I try to see where the person is coming from. And why do you think that is? Because I think that it's, because of my laid-back personality. And as long as the person isn't slowing, the team down obstructing us from our goals obstructing us from doing our work, slowing down, progress, messing themselves up. Then I think that it's okay.

How typical is that of you? Why do you think that is? Okay. Okay, I can think of a time when I was shooting a workspace with some co-workers and every day, I would just do my best and keep his little things as possible on my desk and in my workspace and I've always throw the trash in the trash bin immediately because so many people using the same workspace and it can get cluttered very easily but typically if I have my own workspace where it's just me organize pretty much just a necessity so that the cleanup and organization can be easy and It's not much stuff to move around and Shuffle here and Shuffle there. And why do I think that is? I think it's trial and error because before I would have a lot of stuff on my desk and then I would have to figure out like puzzle pieces, together, trying to figure out where to put this, where to put this way to put this but I'm like, okay. Do I really need most of this stuff that's in my workspace? The answer was no. So clamp down on it and I organized my area and it's been that way since"

But as part of a team, as part of a company, I think for me weaknesses would be. I think listening is a big one. I think attend to hear things, but not fully, listen to them, because I'm constantly on the go. I think that it's important to have that kind of a Understanding of the difference between hearing and listening. I've taken it upon myself to look into better ways of communicating, including reading books, that have that as the main focus in the communication part of it, being listening, and being able to use that to your benefit."

I think I've been tasked with making professional decisions more. So, by personal things have happened, I'm trying to think of anything. I mean, I think probably the only time I've ever met be seen something like that is when I wanted to go from more of of a regular position which at the time was customer service. Representative towards perhaps doing something more managerial, which was at what's considered team lead for me. It was a huge decision because I'm tend to be a type of person that likes to feel like I understand my position fully before I jump into anything managerial, I think I started to look more into. What that would mean, what kind of responsibilities I To take asking questions for for having that information from people who were already there at the level where I wanted to be. And I think the reason for me is because I need to have all the details in order to make what I would feel would be an informed decision. I think I've learned over the years that making a decision based on limited information because sometimes cause you to make a mistake, it's better just to have all the information up front rather than be surprised.

I think this was real, that's always been my the type of Personality that I have. I've always been very quiet, very reserved, very serious, very young age. So I've always been that way, I've always been more of an absorber rather than Super Active participant. I think, for the most part that tends to kind of stick with you, even as you grow older. I think once I see that there is people who I feel like I have things more in common with, I tend to be more open. With them, but I'm usually pretty slow to open up.

I think typically my default for in a situation where I'm uncomfortable with its annoyed or upset or anything like that, my default setting is just to walk away from the situation. I think that the best way because allowing yourself to put yourself in a more negative headspace. It's really not only bad for you, but for the other person it's easier to just Go ahead and walk away from the situation and allow yourself a breather and then go back to the situation. If the person has continued to be annoying at that point, then you definitely want to address the issue and definitely in a non-threatening waves, so that they understand like a, you know, I understand you think this is funny but honestly, it's annoying to me, you know, if you can not do this behavior in front of me or around me, I would really appreciate it.

I start to bother me and to me a chaotic environment, tends to make me feel chaotic, not a control, and anxious. So it's not something that I look forward to. Why do I think that is? I'm not really sure. I think that, I think maybe because of the way that I grew up, my mom was a very firm believer of everything in this place and a place for everything. So, it always me. Made me feel better to have everything organized in a way that I can find things quickly that I don't have to continuously look for things or that will cause me any additional stress that is completely unnecessary.

A, she would ask so many questions. It does. Get annoying a little while.

But if it's something that they're intentionally doing or they're aware, you know, it's annoying me or others and they somehow find enjoyment out of that. I will either call them out on it. Or. I will. Somehow try to find a way to show them that what they are doing is really annoying. And how would they like it? but for the most part, if I'm comfortable enough with that person and I've known them long enough or work with them long enough, then I will just politely explain that what they're doing is annoying and again, mostly if it's A more intentional thing. Even intentional possibly depending and if that doesn't work, then I might have to go to my Superior and discuss it with them.

I have worked. on a range of levels from working as a janitor and working as taking care of the grounds. Cleaning hotel, rooms, cleaning dorm rooms, everything up to teaching on the undergraduate level. So, I think that I have been In a number of different work situations and I have been able to work successfully at least for a certain amount of time in a variety of work situations. I'm just to quickly give you an overview. Perhaps I should have done this at the beginning. But anyway, I've worked as a janitor cleaning dorm rooms. Port. Weeding the grass and flower beds cutting grass. I've cleaned hotel rooms. I wash dishes, then I've worked in a scholarly setting. As a teacher's assistant on the undergraduate and on the graduate levels. I've taught English as a foreign language in several different countries. I've also taught essay writing and then I've also taught on online courses. In fact, I'm currently doing that. I've also lately been getting into writing and editing. So I really feel like I've worked on a number of different jobs in a number of different settings, commercial and academic, and for a wide range of employers, everything from professors to the head of housekeeping. So I think those are my strengths just being able to successfully work in a wide variety of work environments. Um, I see. I have 10 seconds left. So I'm just going to quickly say that my weaknesses are with time. I kind of tend to get bored with some of my work."

But also someone who is easygoing And yet, at the same time, I guess I do have pretty strong personal opinions on things like politics. So, maybe the best word would be complicated. I'm a strange mix in certain settings on pretty good drawing and quiet and other settings. I'm pretty noisy and vocal. Sometimes I'm pretty chilling easygoing other times. I can be pretty intense and active soul. I guess they would say, I change a lot depending on the setting, depending on the environment."

Professional decisions that could affect my status or how much money I make. I think what's more important to me is the purpose of what I'm doing and how it makes me feel. And if I can contribute to the well-being of my colleagues and co-workers more than status or money, I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I don't value do. Those things they are both important, especially money, I don't know so much about status. But at the end of the day, what are you going to do with all that money? You, you can't sleep within, you can't eat it. The most important things are getting along with others and finding satisfaction in what you do. So I I try to take those things into consideration and not sacrifice them, simply for the sake of Of padding, my bank account or something like that."

I don't really have so much self-confidence especially in the beginning in a new environment and with new people. So I kind of tend to take a backseat and be quiet and observe until I know what's going on until I figure out. The group dynamics, what the different personalities are on, how they deal with each other. And then I try to be more vocal and to make more contributions and to speak my mind more clearly, I think it's important to kind of get a good idea of what's going on before you kind of enter into The Fray otherwise you might make some pretty big mistakes that could easily. Ali be avoided. If you had only, you know, taking some time to observe before engaging."

Unfortunately, I tend to keep quiet which may seem wise at the beginning, but over the long term, when you keep quiet, things tend to build up. And I tend to kind of shy away from from confrontation and dealing with things until it accumulates and then you know it gets to a point where I break down and bad things happen. So I think that's something I need to work on to kind of calmly, but openly discuss a problem that I'm having a somebody's annoying me or bothering me so that this can be dealt with before it comes to a Breaking Point. And also that person might not even be aware that they are annoying me until it's too late for something to be worked out. So yeah, that's definitely something that I need to work on. Why do I think that is? I think that is because I have a somewhat non-confrontational personality it's in my nature to let things slide, it's much easier just to ignore stuff and to say oh it's not a big deal whatever and then it builds up so it's certainly something that I need to work on personally character-wise."

It was part of the overall structure, our whole team wasn't organized. Well, and we didn't really have clear guidelines, and it just we have just a lot more work because we had an organized things. The workroom wasn't organized our little workstations, weren't organized, the procedures weren't clear. Everybody was kind of doing their own thing. It isn't typical of me. I'm not the most organized, but I still like to have structure. I still like to, To know I'm doing this. This is the way I do it. I am flexible within it but still this is the overall structure. So I think in that situation I kind of adopted. The way that it was done in the workplace which is okay, to a certain degree, you have to do that to fit in with the organization. But on the other hand, I think I could have worked harder to influence things to move in a more organized Manner. And also within my own workstation, as much as possible have my own little system, things would have gone much smoother. Jobs would have been done, much quicker and better if I had had more organization."

There's been times when I've done trade jobs, where we'd be in the middle of nowhere. Three hours from home, the boss is on vacation and all of a sudden the company credit card doesn't want to work. So in that case I would literally have paid out of pocket to get the supplies at the at Home Depot and have my boss reimburse and we got very highly Complicated by this by this client.

There was a little bit of an adjustment period, but eventually, you know, no things. Things worked out in a more positive direction.

I had a former coworker who just would Just go out of his way, just to be annoying, and he thought he was really funny, but he clearly wasn't, you know, he would just tell the same jokes over and over and over that. You know, we're basically dad jokes, but not even, you know, at least dad jokes or sometimes funny. I mean, you know, I can't tell you how many times this guy would say, that's what she said, or anything, like really kind of cliche like that or just make perverted comments or not. You know, just just kind of inappropriate stuff for work. So I mean, basically I just went out of my way to try to avoid him unless I had to work with him, and if I had to work with him that day, I would make sure that was the day. I wore my headphones to work but yeah, I would just nod and smile, you know? Cuz Me doing my job properly has nothing to do with him being kind of a jerk. So yeah, that's how I dealt with it."

A pigsty, we had like a supplier, kind of office, like, avoidance in the Supply Closet, but it was like a full room for, you know, all the tools and equipment that we needed and like, keep in mind, this is very expensive stuff that we had to install and Yeah it was never organized. So I would make sure you know if we had a big job I'd come in early that day and with one of the better senior employees and we would make sure we had to had to go even if we had to go dig through stuff for it, you know, we make sure we had all our supplies ready for when we went to the job because, you know, people Paid a lot of money for us to install these, these products.

I really like to be able to think about a problem and come up with multiple Solutions. I don't think you should just always do things the exact same way. If there's something, or a better way of being able to get better results or more timely results, I like to pursue those. What I do think is one of my weaknesses is that sometimes your strengths can be over-represented or you can over Flex those strengths. And so, they can turn into a weakness. So I think, you know, one of the things that I have to make sure I do as an employee is to not just spend all of this time being hyper analytical really deep dive analyzing something. And they're not take action. So I try to really time box X. All of that kind of process to be able to look at issues or look for Solutions, or do research because you want to be able to, at some point. Say, all right, I've done enough research. It's now time to make a decision."

I am also a hard worker and I am caring, but my type of caring isn't to just help it is to do more than that. It is to try to teach someone to fish rather than just hand over a bunch of fish, you know. I think some of the other aspects that my best friend would describe grab me as is that I'm willing to learn. I'm curious, I'm also a risk averse. I'm not going to go down a black diamond ski slope. If I don't feel 100% comfortable and that may mean I won't even go down and blue. But I'm also thoughtful, I tend to be very decisive and that I give good advice even sometimes if that advice is, is is a little blunt, but I do it in a very caring way. And so I have a lot of friends that will come to me when they need to hear the truth of something. Even if it may be something that is difficult to hear, Typically to, I think they would also say is that I am not someone that is hard pressed for time. In other words, you know, I'm not, I'm not that type of person that oh, my gosh, if you're not sitting at your desk for eight hours and that doesn't mean that you worked. So I like to look at results versus you know, did you just sit and do something for a sustained amount of time? I think also, my friends would say that I have a quirky sense of humor. Sometimes, I find things very funny that that others don't and you know I think my best friend would also say that sometimes I can be a little bit odd but that makes me more different or a little bit more interesting than say someone else in our friends group."

How do I usually behave in those situations? And why do you think that is? So I do like money. I'm not going to lie, I like being successful, but I also don't believe in compromising my values, or my beliefs or my work ethic. So in other words, a good example would be, I used to work at a very large corporation, they were private, but I just lost all kinds of zest and and feel for what I was doing at that organization. It was very steady Eddie, like I could have done my job in my sleep. I would have still probably received. Fantastic bonuses, shares profit-sharing, like benefits. That were the catalog version of what most people would get an organization. But I just felt like that staying there and just taking money without having the passion for what I was doing. Isn't really, it's not a good thing. And so, Decided to go to a much smaller firm. A very small. So we're talking about 55,000 people to 10 so huge change and to really do something that gave me passion. But also where I felt like I could make immediate impacts and where the velocity and pace of change could be different. And so for me I gave up money. I gave a healthy, fantastic 401K match. I gave up things that yeah, it probably will. Impacting long-term, especially for retirement. But I also believe that those aren't the most important things and so if you are able to do something that gives you passion, if you're able to do something that really is Meaningful for me, that's one of my key values is to not just kind of have Culloden and have to do something just the very basic I wanted to do something that was A little bit more fulfilling and I wanted to be able to do work that was meaningful, but also that you would get the absolute best out of me. So why do I think that? Things are that way, you know, I do believe I have a very strong moral compass and I think sometimes it's unpleasant to stand up for what she believed. And so that's why I believe, I react that way."

So I try to introduce myself, I try to find areas of, where do we have commonalities? And how do you really form a team and how do you start to build that that process? And so I try to get to know my co-workers on a more personal level, understand where they came from, what drives them, what would they like to get out of the experience? And then I start trying to find things that we have commonalities with and sometimes there isn't a lot. And then you just have to, you know, you have to try to start forging kind of a team from scratch or from, you know, you're very alien to each other but I think it's really important when yes, you have the work that has to be done. That's what I normally joined teams, right? It's a project team. It's something like you've been tasked to do something. So you got to do that whether you like each other or not, and I don't think you have to like everyone, but you have to respect people and work together and sometimes As if you can build a personal relationship, then that helps to kind of form that team. So you can storm together for common goals in the times, where maybe we were just, we're not at all alike. It's still just then start looking at like, wow, you're an expert at say? Change management. I want to learn from you. I want to get to know you and a different level. And so that's how I personally act, and then I try to really listen more than talk so that we can get to know. To know each other and and then be able to kind of build that trust and respect so that as you continue to work together as a team that Things become easier because you have mutual respect and kind of respect and not only work ethic together but you really kind of build something together where you have that trust that hey if they say they're going to do something, they're going to do it and if I say I'm going to do something, they're going to trust that. I'm going to do it too, and that we have kind of our common goal. Well, as our shared objective."

So I think, yes, I have situations where people annoy me, but most of the time I take, I take a step back and think, To myself. I mean, I'm sure I annoy them is that really detrimental to working together? No, you know, if it's something in terms of annoying because maybe you're continuously not delivering something or you're not coming to meetings on time and it's disruptive to the team, then I'll take that person aside or I'll ask to speak to them where it's private one-on-one and say, Hey, you know, and I had to do that before. I had a co-worker, she was at the same level as me, we're both in leadership and Now, I explained to her that, you know, I like sarcasm personally. However, I could tell that when people don't know, you sarcasm comes off very differently, it comes off, can kind of be as mean and so that it has a place, but be judicious about how to leverage it and then I could tell she was a little bit defensive at first but, you know, then the night I said, I just noticed how some people reacted in the room and, you know, maybe this group they're just not, they're just not seeing it, they're not, they're not enjoying. Ourselves with it. That doesn't this mean to say that we can't you can't do that in a different environment or different group. But the only time I really said something to her was when I could tell, when I could read the room that some people, it was really having a very adverse effect on. So, you know, I think the reason why I like that was I know that I know that I'm annoying to people. You may be annoyed listening to me on this interview. So we all do that. That's not, that's the nature of Being Human. But if it is becoming destructive to an environment, then you have to take a person aside and actually have a conversation about it."

Like I like organized space, organized work. So it's pretty atypical for me to be disorganized and work workplace. Yeah, this kind of was also my staging ground for some other things like for my personal life because I work from home predominantly and so I know instead of doing a different type of lunch break today, I'm playing to get myself organized because I need that especially moving into the new year. That makes me be able to think, freely and focus on work and not be distracted by. Oh, gosh, where those papers over there for, what are those files for? So that's really important to me and why do I think it's that important? I think you know, organized work is number one, it helps you to be able to when you don't have to think about what's next. I didn't think about that. What's the timeline then? You can't really focus on the tasks have to be completed and to me, a disorganized workspaces the same way. You know, you start feeling like well, I can't find something that I, my notepad because everything is disorganized. So for me, it's important to get that resolved when it starts to slip, especially the workplace so that I can focus freely on work."

I remember I was looking for an invoice for a client and took me an hour and a half to find what I needed to find. It was very stressful because it was something I needed right away for my client and I even had one of my co-workers, the secretary help me look for it because I was getting so frustrated. So it is very typical for me to be very disorganized. I think the reason for that is first of all, I'm eighty HD and second of all. It's just my personality and how I've always been. I've always had to try really, really hard to stay organized. It doesn't come naturally to me. So I kind of have to force myself to be that way to put it. The effort to, you know, have everything together and put everything in their proper place. Otherwise I'll just have a big mess of papers and other random things things that don't go together. So I try to take 15 minutes in each of my work days to actually organize the papers that I have for that day or other things I have"

I can relate to people and they can relate to me right off. I'm really good at reading people. I'm really intuitive. So that's helped me in pretty much every job that I've had because I'm able to help people and build trust with them right off. So I feel that that's one of my main strengths, one of my weaknesses, I guess you could say is I'm very detail-oriented. So sometimes I spend too much time on little details instead of just wrapping up something I try to work on that and make sure I'm not spending too much time on little things that don't matter. So that would be probably one of my biggest weaknesses is being a perfectionist."

They would really probably describe me as one of the greatest people ever, because I'm really easy to get along with and I don't have a lot of flaws or bad habits, I guess you could say, I'm really funny. Also, I crack everyone up that I know. So they always say that I'm super funny. So that's probably one of Things, my best friend would use to describe me."

Here is some things that I've seen in the workplace when it comes to sexual harassment bullying racism. Things like that that I've spoken up about because I'm not just going to look the other way. Nobody's going to get away with acting that way in life, not in the workplace, not outside in public. Not in private you just can't act like that and get away with it. So I make sure to tell people when they're acting like that that it's inappropriate and that it's not going to be tolerated and I tell my bosses that and I don't care if If I get fired, I don't care if they demote me, I don't care what happens, but I'm not going to put up with things like that, and I think that they know that."

Because I think that's really important to know everybody's personality and work Styles before you start jumping into things. I really just observe for a little bit and try to find my place and help everyone and see what works because I'm just going by my past experiences. That's that's why I behave that way. Because trial and error If I did not behave in that way, I feel that there would be problems. You know, people being misunderstood or misunderstanding me.

When someone annoyed me, the only thing that bothers me and my work life and personal life is people being rude, people being careless and people bullying and hurting others. I don't put up with things like that. I'm really positive person and you know I feed off of other people's pain. Positive energy. So when there's a negative vibe or energy and the bunch, it's just like a dark cloud. I just, I want to cut it out immediately out of my life at a from work everything. So if there's a problem, you know, like there there has been several cases where I've had to tell on people for making degrading comments to women and It's just annoying is, there's no place for that at work and, you know, you want to pick up a woman and talk to her that way, do it somewhere else, but it's not going to happen at work.

I just kind of Overlook it and sweep it to the side whatever I need to do. I am always very organized. So I know eventually I'm going to get to it. So if it is messy or whatever, I just don't want to bother me. I just acknowledge that I need to fix it and go from there. Happens about twice a week. Probably for me. So it's nothing.

So, sometimes I have to take a little bit of effort in order to keep myself on track and focused. I'm very good at multitasking but sometimes that's not I find this not the correct in a way to go about things so I'm a little bit more effective if I'm focused on one thing at a time.

So, sometimes you do get a little bit nervous when I know. there's, a decent amount of weight on that situation because, you know, internally, I can see the importance of the entire situation and how that can affect you know, my career or just the amount of money that I'm making, so I think.

So Making a good first impression, I think is important to me and I want to be seen as somebody that is a benefit and you know, adding to the productivity of the team instead of somebody that is just sliding along or somebody, that's maybe a detriment to the team and dragon team down."

So I'm the reason why I react like that. I think I'm very even-keeled not to reactionary on certain things. So so unless they really gone above and beyond annoying me for the most part, I don't react too much, I stay pretty even Keel and actually think about the situation and what I can do too. To rectify it or why it annoyed me try to internalize, you know, the whole situation there."

Writing a little notes down that used to be. You know, if it was writing something down, quick something I had referred to All the Right Stuff on Post-it notes. Something that was important like passwords or people's phone numbers or something had to, you know. Refer to, but as Technologies gotten, you know more advanced. I've become a lot better. So my work stations pretty organized. I don't have Post-its of you where I typically write everything down my notes and in my phone or on my computer in a note program. And that's the helps to keep me organized and declutter everything. So Just for me, if I have to, if I can write stuff down and not have to ask people again, and again, for certain bits of information, and also not have to, you know, Scramble for the stuff that I need, it helps that I can focus on actually using my brain power for the important tasks, and not just remembering or struggling to pull those information bit.

I'm trying to step back and listen more. Ask them to come back at a different time just so that you can process their viewpoints in that long like an extra time to process their viewpoints. Because sometimes it really is just a misunderstanding at that moment which in my quickly escalate into something you don't want to happen."

Also my best friend would describe me as someone who is punctual and on time and someone who doesn't like to be late to things. Another thing they would describe me as is kind of uptight because I like my area and my surroundings to be almost kind of permanent into is where I don't have to expect anything unexpected."

There's going to be a positive and successful outcome. Although, as far as money goes, Although I am happy as long as I'm happy, I'm okay. Making a little bit less money.

I wanted to be a manager at the store that I had currently worked at because I was familiar with the customers and the, my co-workers and the manager at that store at the time as well. Although the regional manager had something else in mind and he ended up transferring me to a new location where I didn't know anyone. At first, it was a little intimidating because I didn't know if the other employees there would take me serious because of me being a new person coming in and them, not really knowing me or my work ethic at all. So, it was a little bit I guess, anxiety-inducing at first, Although when I showed up and people saw my work ethic and the kind of mood, I stay in when I'm working and try to keep everything, upbeat, and positive and stuff, everything went really well. The people I started working with started to actually enjoy working with me and honestly their work performance turned around a little bit because they didn't have someone constantly yelling at them."

And so I was busy and had no other option other than to stay busy, did be able to get everything done. Although it seemed that one day everyone from my customers to my other employees seemed to just lack Any kind of quickness about them. And this was annoying me because I knew of all the stuff I had to get it done but it seemed like everything else. Everyone else was just slowing me down and not allowing me to be able to do what I needed to do. This caused me issues and cause me get stressed out. And honestly I didn't compose myself the best. I ended up telling my employee just to do their job at the moment and to let me be And I think that is because I just wanted to be able to have a successful walk through when the owner came.

I worked at and so that involved me having to run and operate two different stores at the same time. And when I was working at the other person store I was having to deal with their organizational skills and stuff and their workspace and it just seemed like nothing was organized. I couldn't find anything that was frustrating. It just seemed to slow everything down and is just wasn't optimal. I think that is They're the workspace was cluttered because the other manager either didn't care or just it's just what they were used to and it's what makes them feel comfortable. Generally. That is not very typical of me. I like to keep my own workspace pretty organized because when I need something, I want to know where it is, whether it's supplies, files on a computer. Anything I want to know where it is so it doesn't slow me down and so that I can just Keep On Truckin along with work without having to look for stuff. Also, it makes me feel more confident in myself and makes me a little bit more relaxed because it's just the general cleanliness."

There are not many things like it. Stopped me from working. Once I get started, I do very much believe in doing something right. Very detail-oriented in that way. I do pay attention to the little things. I think it helps to complete kind of a bigger picture when you're more detailed oriented. So hard-working detail-oriented For weaknesses. I think I can tend to get this organized especially when I'm focusing on a larger project or when there's many aspects, your project or many teams or people involved, I do combat that by just having files organizing taking time to organize my laptop in the morning or my emails."

Once I get started, I do have a lot of kind of energy reserves, especially for things like that. Definitely communicative. My best friend personally is had a lot of trouble with kind of sorting through her emotions and I've helped her a lot with that. Being a more communicative person, myself and loyal. I've been friends with my best friend for just about 15 years now. And they were just here for a week after I moved. So definitely loyal as well. Yeah."

How do I behave in such situations? And what I think that is personally, I don't tend to be too worried about status or making a whole lot of money. I mean, everybody needs to make money. Obviously, that's not what I mean. But more, what I mean is that status or more money or status, that comes with more money is never been a priority for me. How do I behave in those situations? If I were to make those decisions, I guess I would. Cover all of my bases. Try to play Devil's Advocate a little bit and think of it from, as many different angles I can possibly think of why do I think that is? Because that's generally important to me to think of everything from every side before I make a decision."

Yeah, I've been in quite a bit of teams at least in my professional career. I do work in Tech so that does kind of move quickly and you do change teams a lot or even just team processes, right? People come in and out. But how do I behave when I enter a new team? I definitely try to get to know everybody in a new team at least on a certain level 2. Because I think it's important especially if you were on the same project together. Why do I think that is? I think that generally it's important for me to have a good feel of who I'm working with and what role it is that they have as well when we're working together. Especially in case I need help or maybe a full work on some project together as well. It's it's usually important to me that I have a good grasp on who they are, how they work, things like that."

And if you haven't been annoying, up until this point, you probably will be the annoying person at some point, even if you are unknowingly being annoying, how do I react in those situations? I try to keep that in mind. That even if you feel as though you haven't been the annoying person, you maybe not on purpose. So I try to keep that in mind that maybe they don't know, right? If they're clearing the throat too much and it's annoying me or something, you know, not a big deal like that. Why do I think that is? Because I typically don't like to make a big deal of things. I think that there are a lot more important things to focus on than if someone is being annoying and because we've all been there, it's not a big deal to me and I don't like to make a big deal over it."

I think, I mean, life moves fast, especially in the field that I'm in. It's always always moving and that isn't a bad thing. It is a good thing for me personally, but, yeah, it's easy for my worker workspace, to not get very organized, especially in the middle of an important project or some kind of team collaboration. How typical is that of you? It's pretty typical. I do. I try to take time out of my week to organize. At least something once a day, but I used, I like to do one big one, maybe once or twice a week. Why do I think that is? I think that I can get caught up in action without taking the time to kind of Tidy Up or maybe polish the edges of my workspace while I'm working."

I like collecting foreign coins and that gives me the opportunity to learn about other places and then when you go and have them all on a page I like to do a sheet in front of it that kind of explains like the culture of the place and the things you'll find whether it be like the The different terrains there. The different things to do, what the people are, like, what they eat. And you know what their traditions and Customs are. That's something I really enjoy and I think my best friend would definitely say that. I'm a good person and we have a lot of history together.

I didn't really want to be in charge of people. I was kind of happy where I was at.

I didn't really do it for a personal issue. Love, like making them more money because I was content with where I was at, but I wanted to I kind of did it for everybody and it turned out, okay? I think the relationships are forged before becoming a manager really paid off and then my the way I run things has has panned out in that sense, they all know what to expect. And we all look out for each other. I'm no different than them and I work the same. I will do the same exact stuff that they are doing and I think they respect that the previous manager was not like that. They were a little bit more.

I think I can earn the respect of people more like that and that's just based off of people have come into my work and you get somebody who comes in and just, you know, thinks a know-it-all and I run things in there really does, it Clash well with the rest of the crew, they cardamom need to earn the respect of the people.

He says I'm having a great day today. I was like that's great like they keep this guy's going to be easy today. And he says, aren't you going to ask me why? I'm having a great day. I'm like, oh no, here it comes. He's I said, why are you having a great day? He says, cuz Bosch has gave me something for free today. He said, Safeway gave me something for free today, he said, what are you going to give me for free today? Like sir, we don't have anything that is free on the menu today. Like I said, I can't give you anything for free, but I'd love to help you find something. And I'm sure we could find something at a sale price.

Like I don't understand why people have to come in and be so nasty, especially to like the workers and we're all there to do our jobs and we are all there to you know, everybody just wants to have. An okay. Time will do it.

Especially when I don't leave things like that. I am very organized person. I know where everything's at. I know what I have and I know what needs to be done. So, I need to have patience with people who do not have the same mindset. I've worked in it and I worked under people are very disorganized and the ship can't run like that. I get irritated with the people come in and if I if it's not left, how I would leave it if it was left, very nicely for them and they were had everything in a row, and then I expect them to leave it for the next person like that, it makes all of us easier it makes the schedule around easier, it makes a whole day. Just all the gears move easier when we are organized. When everybody knows what's going on, when everybody knows what needs to do.

So, I actually do tend to do a lot of research on my own and for some reason that really gets me a lot of results like I would be researching over and over again and then I would just have all of that compiled into like a document and great and just like a big thing and then I just try and kind of compiled my greatest solution into that. As far as like my greatest weakness, I would say it would be have to do with a lot of social stuff. Like presenting a lot of that is very weird and can lead to a lot of problems. And as a direct result. I tend to have create like this weird haphazard response that just makes me seem a lot less smart and I ordinarily would be if you had just like given me more time, letting me compile like this because result, essentially, I am also very prone to getting over what as well.

A sort of less severe situation. I would actually be more anxious about it. which is weird, but I think that does present a very good shrinks, so a less severe situation. I would just be like, I would think about like how it could affect me a whole lot more, but in a more severe situation, it would be like, I don't even give it a second thought, my focus is entirely on the situation.and the way, the reason why I think that is the case, honestly. I don't know, it's just like some weird sense of calmness that makes me behave in that way. it's just my natural tendency to just behave a lot better in like, A harsher situation, but not so much in a calmer one. And I don't really understand fully why? That is the case."

I think it's just like, the new Typically I think it's just like anxiety due to a new situation in a new team and stuff like that, essentially. After that, I tend to be very calm. And then I I've always been told I like meshed, well, with the group surprisingly. and as a result, generally have just been pretty focused on my work and how it goes and I generally get along with people very well. And most people tended to like me. So, Yeah, I think it's just like an adjustment period more than anything else."

So, a situation where someone annoyed me, I would say it's more like us It's not common for people to annoy me first of all. But generally, I tend to be very patient and I generally just keep it calm in to myself and try to address the issue. And I'm more personal and Conger, way, I guess, is the way to describe it. And generally, I just try to resolve the situation before it kind of explodes and And then I would just hope for the best. Really and, So I don't really react much at all. The reason why I think that is, I think I'm just the reason why I think that is is pretty much I think it's just typing always been a patient person. Like I would just sit there. and I generally just, Kind of learned draw my life to be to sit there and listen to people because I know what it's like to feel like you're not listening to you. So when someone's being annoying, I know that they're not trying to essentially."

It's been like, very unorganized and it usually gives me anxiety, like it makes me very anxious when I get into a situation like that. and of course, it generally just gets resolved or really quickly if I'm able to and it's very rare me and I think it's I'm just naturally organized like I've always been like very anxious when things aren't organized. And I think it's just because if things are organized, and it just looks like a very big messy, chaos of nightmares to me and that does not look or feel good. So I've always tended to stay in the organized space if that if you will"

So I would say, one of my greatest strengths is that I am very self-motivated, I like things to be done the very best they can. I spare no time or effort, or I guess thought, when it comes to getting things done, right? Whether it be for the company, I work for, or any of our clients or potential clients, I am the kind of person that will put two hundred percent effort in to make things just perfect every time. I'm also very thorough and have a lot of attention to detail and that goes into wanting things to be just, right? Let's see, what else? I I'm an enthusiastic learner. I like to learn new things. I like to feel productive, like I'm being a part of something, while I'm learning new things, big asset of mine is I'm a creative Problem, Solver. So somebody puts a problem in front of me, I am immediately motivated to try and come up with Solutions. And a lot of times, they will be solutions that perhaps haven't been thought of before at that company. So I like to bring new ideas to the table. I think one of my greatest strengths that I mentioned before, it's also one of my greatest weaknesses which is that I want everything done, perfect all the time while that a lot of times results in happy clients and happy employers. Sometimes I think I just have to learn to leave well enough alone. You know, I lot of times things will be just fine the way they are good enough. And if I've got an extra you know, our so to spend on it, I will do that. I will beat a dead horse until I think everything is perfect and I have high expectations. So I think that that's an example of how one of my weaknesses and strengths is kind of the same thing."

She has always told me that this is something that she was attracted to in me as a friend for since the beginning that I don't associate my value as a woman with devaluing other women that I believe that there is enough room for all women to succeed. Equally and that if we're going to do so we need to support each other. She would also say that I am kind of a goofball. I like to have fun. I like to make other people smile and there are a lot of things that, you know, I will do to do that. Whether it be thinking of someone sending them a note or picture bringing them a gift. She would also say I'm quirky, but there are a lot of Is that I do or say that are a little out of the ordinary or different, just that an effort to be original again to make people laugh? She would probably say I am the life of the party that again, I like, you know, people to be entertained I like people to be having a good time and most of the time I use self-deprecating humor for that What else would my best friend say about me? She would say that I love animals. She often teases me about how I like animals More Than People which isn't true, but she does tell me that I like animals a lot ones that aren't even mine. She would say that she thinks that I'm a creative person I think. She used to serve me in one of my creative Endeavors and so she often complimented me on my creativity and coming up with new ideas."

Those are not the primary to motivators. For me, opportunity is the largest motivator. The most of my career. I've been on kind of an upward trajectory so a lot of times opportunity also equals Status and more money for instance. You know, I started at an entry-level and I've been kind of climbing up the ladder to now you know, more of a management level and that comes with higher status and it comes with higher money. But that's not what I was seeking. I was seeking opportunity and a lot of times it was the opportunity to implement change. So I saw things, you know, that other people and management had done throughout my career that I didn't think were Working or particularly motivated by the right things. And so my motivation to take a management position was to try something different to see if I could affect lives, positively of the people that worked underneath me. So, I guess I would maybe say that that's status. But I really only take them because I want to effect positive change. Now, again A lot of times that includes more money because it includes more responsibility, but that's not the primary reason for me, taking wanting, seeking out those jobs. I think that's because I want everybody to enjoy what they do. I think it's because I see opportunity to improve things and I feel like, if I can see it, then it's my responsibility. Responsibility to try and take it to try and make it happen. So I would say in terms of how do I behave in the situations? I seek out status and them in a way to effect change. I don't necessarily seek out money. I don't really like money and I think that I do that because I want to improve the quality of life."
5cc8cab1f67ce800171cc5b2_q4_c1_1671735412_70817ab2-019d-4fcf-a4e7-1cc5f7fcff32,"Okay, I've actually been in a lot of situations where I enter a new team of people both at work and in life in general. And I tend to, I guess you could say tiptoe in I want to try to make my transition into those as seamless and effortless for the other people as possible. I don't want to rock the boat too much. At first, I don't want to have people have a bad. Bad first impression of me or have them, you know, feel like dealing with me is going to be, you know, more work for them. So I like to be pleasant. I like to bring extra things to the table. You know, to essentially prove my worth just say, hey, having me around is going to be a benefit to you guys. I'm here to work with you. I think I do that because I want people to look forward to being associated with me to being Teams with me. I want them to know I come in peace and I want to work with them. And I want this to be a, you know, collaborative copacetic kind of thing. Now, I will say I, you know, after I observe people and I kind of get the lay of the land and the dynamic, and I understand what, you know, what's motivating to the different people on that team, I will start to make more waves. I'm Unapologetic of that. I don't like to enter situations coming. And assuming I know everything and it doesn't do any good for me to try to accomplish anything. If I don't know, enough about the people on the team to understand what motivates them to understand, what's going to get them, you know, to hear what I'm trying to say. So definitely tiptoe in get a lay of the land and then from there, once I feel like I have that, I tend to be a little bit more aggressive. And some of the things that I think that the team Should be addressing."

I am not good at reacting to people when I'm annoyed, when I'm annoyed with somebody, I tend to stay annoyed with somebody once. I've crossed that threshold, it's not good. I will say it takes a lot for me to be annoyed, but once I am is just sort of a permanent status but, I guess I'm not really confident ational about it. My first step really is to just kind of distance myself from the person and try to step away from the annoying Behavior. So, you know, not be around them as much. Try to shorten the conversation or make sure there's other people involved in the conversation. So I don't have to just strictly deal with the annoying Behavior. And I think I do that because I don't want to have to tell somebody that they're annoying. What's annoying to me is not necessarily annoying to other people when everyone else might think they're delightful. And unless they're doing something that I think is you know, like morally or ethically wrong. It's not really my place to tell them that their behavior is making, you know, It's unpleasant to me that's kind of to each their own, you know. So my first course of action when I find somebody to be annoying is to distance myself from them, if they confront me about it and they want to know why I will, you know, try to find a very politically correct way to just tell them that, you know, some of the things they do or say are not in my preference and it's, you know, no harm, no worries. It's just That kind of a thing. So and I think I do that because I don't want to, I don't really want to hurt anybody's feelings. I also just really don't want to be annoyed. So yeah. So my first step in being annoyed is to avoid them and that usually does the trick less face-to-face contact."

I'm not proud of it. I have a creative explosion, kind of mind and sometimes I take off on an idea and I'm so focused on it that I don't realize. I've left a trail of disaster behind me and then I tend to get excited about the next thing I'm focusing on and not go back and clean up the first disaster and over and over and over again, till I can't function anymore. Any more till it's a big enough disaster. This is my physical workspace. I'm talking about. It's a big enough disaster that I can actually, you know, mentally function. And I have to go back and clean it all up. So it's very typical of me for my physical workplace to be messy. And I think it is because I am a person that is chasing the creative answers. I'm chasing the ideas and I forget to go back and clean up the mess. That is left in its place. I'm excited by the idea. Of new things. I am not excited by the idea of old things and that previous mess is an old thing. So not going to do it, my work like the actual work that I do, you know, generating ideas coming up with things to deliver to clients, I like to be very organized in that I have work plans, I have Excel spreadsheets. I have you know, check-in points and delivery dates and I'm very scheduled when it comes to my Actual work. I have to be kind of deadline driven, or I won't stop chasing the idea. I won't think that well enough is or won't leave well enough alone. So I am actually very organized in my work and that is I think a product of me learning to tame a, my crazy creative personality and make it marketable for the real world. That is very organized. That's what helps me kind of move forward. The physical work space, not at all. Guys."

I do a lot of independent Contracting work. So I'm always making decisions about which orders I'm taking and if they're worth my time and worth like the mileage that it takes to get to the customer and everything. I also do some work for Amazon and that can be a lot of decisions. As far as like, where to leave the package to be out of sight because like if someone were to take the package, like a thief or, you know, something like that, if something were to happen with the package, then it come all comes back to me and I'm blamed for it. So I have to make sure that nothing like that's affecting my status and then another side I trade stocks and I have to To take a lot of different things into consideration for what could affect the run and how much money can be put into it."

I came in just to like a team of drivers and different like restaurant staff. How I usually behave when entering a new team, you know, I try to just like introduce myself and you know, get to know the people around me a little bit better, but it's also a lot of anxiety to be around new people and to learn, you know, my new place and new group."

One time a bunch of friends were camping and one of my friends just like we were all nice and quiet. Just like, sitting around the campfire. One of my friends was just like blasting music of an artist that I like truly hated. And I remember it really bothering me almost to the point where I had to walk away, but they were having fun.

And if that very seldom has happened, the way that I would usually react in such a situation is pretty much just to try and hop over in their shoes and determine how they feel because that makes a huge difference with a lot of different things. Things with my personality being as outgoing as it is, it takes a lot to annoy me because I've been around the block a lot and I understand that things don't always go the way you want them to, and you just can't really get all aggravated and things. Because if you do, then you're not going to figure out anything and arrive at any type of solution. So yeah, I really haven't been annoyed that much in workplaces.

You generally just ignored especially again and he's work past it or whatever because people like that just are not worth your time as far as personally. Wow. Well, I'm Discord. I had some there was some people who joined our server who were shy to say this. They were troublemakers just through and through and their biggest thing was they had some kind of their people with a cause basically who are so deep into their thinking or whatever that they're just there to argue literally and they argue in bad faith. Of course, and that's extremely annoying because their whole deal is to just push you to react to something and As much as I didn't like it, it did teach me a valuable lesson, how to deal with people like that, you know? And when you experience the extreme extreme end of something like that. Oh boy, do you develop some thick skin after that? You are a lot.

Like I just observed my situation so that I know who's around or what's going on and I just keep to myself and I think my friends my best friends, they were all probably say the same things and they were all probably say maybe. Be different things to because of my experience with them or whenever I hung out with them and school or person, I guess it just depends on the individual."

That could basically like submit my future was whether or not to go to college or go to Community College. And I made the decision to go to Community College and the major that I chose was business administration and the reason why I chose that major Because I just thought that it was interesting, I just like the business aspect when it comes to businesses the marketing, the promotion. Like I really do like marketing when it comes to different things and when it comes to other situations like this I usually just try to just stay tone. I'd usually just try to stay cool. Not let the stress get to me and just calm down and just always just remain optimistic because I know that I would figure out A solution. I will figure out a decision because this is a very critical situation. And when it came to choosing rubber, to go to college Community College, it was a stressful situation, but I I made the right choice. And the reason why I made that choice was because I just had a lot of just different imaginations and fears going to my mind. Like what if I were to go to college? And I graduate with a degree and And I'm not able to get a job with this degree. That is something that I did not want to deal with, and I never thing that I did not want to deal with it all. And I'm super grateful for was student debt, like, taking out loans and stuff like that, because I told myself that I would never do that. And when I was in Community College, I never did that once. Yes, I may have to pay some stuff, but I never had to take out a loan and when I graduated, I was completely free of any issues. But yes, that's what I would probably say. And yeah,"

That is just going to keep to myself, not cause any issues or problems and just just hopefully just hope that my teammates will be the same as me just getting the job done. I'm not causing any issues figuring out what we are supposed to do. As in who works on Dish, who works on that. And I just usually just keep like a cool mind and just and ready to get the job done. And the reason why I am like that is because I never want to do with any issues when it comes to working with teams, always just want to get along with my team and always just want to just like get the job done. When it comes to whatever we're doing. When it comes to projects College work, anything that's all that matters. And I would say, for the most part, whenever I had to work with teams, mostly they've all been positive. We've all gotten a job done. We've all knew what we had to do, and we never had any issues, like, they're probably been, maybe very, very rare occasions where I did not get along with my team or it was just something else, something Petty, but I'm a good team player. I'm always willing to get the job done as long as my team is willing to have the same attitude as me. But that is the reason why I think like that, whenever I am a part of a new team that I'm joining."

When someone usually annoyed me for different reasons when it comes to school college or just talking to people online, there have been many times where I've been annoyed in different situations and how I react in a situation is that I always keep it cool. Like, I never lash out or be extremely rude, or disrespectful to the individual because I I think that is not their intentions, like they just, they do not know that they're being kind of annoying, and I've just always just stay cool. I've always just not stressed out. I don't show it to with my face. I just keep a neutral look whenever they're talking because I know that I want the conversation to end or whatever months I'm doing with this individual and I would say something else that a noise me is whenever someone just has Weird Trace that they do weird habits, like, it's just it's annoying to deal with, and it's just, it's just annoying to see. And the reason why I think that it is is because I just don't want to be like the typical stereotype, that certain people have a black people and I just don't want anyone to see me. Last shout, I don't want to lash out myself. I don't want to get stressed on. Just start brain individual because I know that it's not, right? And if I were to say, Something that would offend the person then that person would probably get mad at me, and it may turn into an argument. And then it may soon to something, I don't want to experience, I don't want to deal with, but I just usually try to just stay, calm neutral, not stress out. And just hope that this conversation or whatever I'm doing with the annoying individual just ends soon."

I would say that, that is probably a rare occurrence with me whenever it was work that I have to do with in school, or just over things in my personal life. Like, that is very rare of me for my work or my work space to not be organized, as I'm usually someone that just wants to get to work. Done immediately. Lee. I was always like that when they came to assignments book report team projects. I always just try to just get my part of the work done so that I didn't have to do with anything. I just I was so that I would just be able to just relax calm down and just enjoy the stress-free situations. And the reason why that I do that, the reason why I try to just get the work done as soon as I can, is because I'm getting your work done, whenever there's like, a deadline and I turned in within like five minutes before it's due dates. It will just cause me too much stress. I would just be extremely stressed and probably have a panic attack. Like I don't like to stress. I don't like dealing with stress and I just don't like it. Whenever my organization or my environment, it's just clustered with different things. From my work, not being professionally. Well done from my organization, Ization.

Here's this option, which is a high-end option and then here's the economical version. So I try to do that as much as possible. Full and why do, I think that is we've been homeless multiple times?

I have a hard time feeling like I fit in anywhere so I kind of assess how things are going, how I can fit. Why do I think that is? Well, Growing up I struggled with that as really badly I was in special education from pretty much the beginning till senior year I'm autistic so I really struggled new people and but again eventually I get to the point where I get to know them they get to know me. I know how to behave, how to act and it works."

It depends what they're doing to annoy me. Annoy me! It was accidental. Then that's, you know, I can brush it off, I can deal with it. But it's consistent and they intentionally keep doing it, it gets more and more under my skin. Again, that is partially due to being autistic and I have a hard time with those things. I'll get annoyed. All may be shut down. I don't really go more than that. It takes a lot for me to snap or get upset with people.

Any problem that leads me into my next strength, which is determination. I am always determined to see through everything from the beginning, to the end. I I just will see it through, no matter how difficult it is, how many hiccups are all along the road. I just keep going and I'm very agreeable and easy to get along with, with my teammates. I listened typically I listen to people. I acknowledge what they have to say, I'm open-minded and I am, I have a great work ethic. I really do some weaknesses. Our us sometimes. I tend to be a little too, a little too forgiving and maybe a little too trusting of others. I like to think that I like to take people for their word but sometimes that doesn't always worked at work out when I, you know, I think people are going to do what they say they're going to do and sometimes they don't.

Make sure I'm friendly. I like to get the first names of all the people in the new team. I think it just makes it a lot more personal and they think that you actually care about meeting them if you can use their first names and Remember, their names. I think this build a rapport with people, I really think that if you can go into a new situation and develop some sort of relationship and nothing in depth but something that you can work with as a foundation for future relationships that the core of what you're trying to achieve really is achieved much more easily than just sitting there and thinking of people as strangers. I mean, if you're forming a new team, You're obviously going to work together toward a goal and I just think, by being open-minded and listening to them, and, and voicing your opinion, and not a pressurized way.

That's easy to do because people can be annoying and the ones who annoy me the most are rude people. These are people that will not listen to. You will shut you down will think very highly of themselves and I don't like anybody who comes off being very ostentatious. I usually react in a way that I, if I'm annoyed, I don't like to engage them. I don't like to build a rapport with them. I simply just let them be who they are and knowing that they think there's somebody there really not. And I'm never rude back, but I just take kind of a backseat approach and I think I do this because I can see how they're trying to portray themselves and that's how I don't want to portray myself. So I kind of take the high road and be the better. A person in any situations where somebody annoys me. If it's some person that I need to work with well then we're going to have to have a conversation about that situation and I'm going to have to voice my opinion. Let them know why they annoyed me and how I felt, and how we can go on and and get over that."

And then after I receive or excuse me, earn my degree, I was able to have a job at a local hospital. And that paid well at the time.

So that laptop kind of got set up on a shelf and there were, you know, screws but again, you know, at least the screws were, you know, contained in a container. Over there have been other times. For example, when I worked, you know, customer service, I would have a lot of notes saved in notepad. Just for my, for my reference from my, you know, personal information. So, I think there's a balance there 50/50, and I think the reason for the information Technology like a laptop. As I mentioned was probably because I just did not have enough time. I was not given enough time to work on it to fix it but on the other hand for example the customer service side I think it was important to record important information so I didn't have to refer back to the information databases that that a lot of companies use these days,"

I just kind of like walk away or just get get some distance from them. Thanks I'm not very comforting tional person so I'm not one. That's like Going to go up to them and be like, hey, your mind me. I'll just like, just go away. I like ignore them. Yeah. Like I've had annoying co-workers before and I generally just like keep distance from them. I feel like that's the most like much her. And like best thing to do is like not like tell them off. I feel like they'll make the work environment kind of hostile. So I feel like just avoiding the them kind of in, like, Getting some space between you and them is really the best solution. That's what I typically do."

That's very like not something that really happens for me. I'm very organized person. I like stuff in its place. I'm like typically a very organized person. I label my things. Everything has the correct place like there are rare occasions when like I'm in a hurry and you know I can't put stuff. Actly where it belongs. But that's generally very rare for me. I think I'm just like a very organized clean person in general and I, like order. I like things where they belong. So, yeah, I just don't really let my workspace, really get that bad. Like it's not disorganized at all. Everything's where it needs to be."

One of my weaknesses is an employee is that I do take a little bit more time to learn how to do something but that's why because I want to learn to do it the best liability. Once I do have that Taskmaster down, I am very proficient at it, so I would say that is my greatest strength and weakness. I think that I'm really good at working as a team member and as an individual, a very versatile in all jobs. I've worked, I've been able to be cross-trained throughout different positions and I'm often look to ask questions by people who are just starting out and beginning. I do have teaching experience so I think that my teaching experience helps with my ability to make others comfortable and learn what they need to be able to learn. So for example if someone is has a learning style, what they need to be walked through then I can screen share with them and walk them through on video and have them go through the motions to learn if someone's more of a writing type of person, I can always send them just what I've created."

I'm somebody who has a sense of humor, I'm very dependent. They'd also say that I'm very empathetic sometimes, too full. I always give great advice and I'm really good at listening to what my friends are going through. Sometimes there's difference between when someone needs to vent and with some would genuinely need advice and I think that's applicable to the workplace as well as sometimes you just have a colleague needs to bank. So they can get over their frustration and go about their day and sometimes you need a colleague who genuinely keeps running into the same type of situation and needs some assistance getting through that. So advice is more. So what is suited for them, you know, think it's a bad idea to like straight or ask somebody if they need advisor. They need to be listened to"

I tend to be quite withdrawn and quiet more. So observing the situation and people like reactions in their faces or take notes on what they're saying. I'm definitely step back from a leadership position of being. So, outward, an extroverted into being more. So introverted because I don't want to like, think before I say jeopardize my Honey, I think it's better to appear intelligent and quiet than ignorant and blurting things out. So that's that's why I behaved that mostly just to protect myself and my reputation and a lot of the times it's because I really don't mess around with my money. So I don't want to blow any type of chance that I might have."

I just kind of observe how people function and interact with one. Another usually I'll end up joining a workplace where someone who's a really good friend of mine works there. That way they could kind of give me the ins and outs of its be careful of because I can be very naive and deceive pretty easily by people. So yeah, very mallinson the hard way quite a few times. Once I get more comfortable with people, I think sometimes my personality can be like two dominant like if somebody needs help or people need help, like, I'm going to go out of my way and help them sometimes people might be in these being like a know-it-all or show off, but that's really, not my intention. My intention is to just make sure people get the correct answers that help them succeed in their position."

Anyways, we're not all webcams where I currently work at sometimes. I'm just very like to the point when I say something to them, but everything is done through chat message. I think that's kind of the beauty of working from home is that even though, you know, you're annoyed and you know how you act when you're annoyed, they don't know. So my shortness comes off more like politeness and kind of being absurd. And or or harsh or anything like that. So, that's that's typically how actual somebody annoys me in a work setting. I don't thinks that there's anything else I want to add but I think the timer's making me continue. Sometimes I feel bad about being annoying as somebody especially when they end up being like nice.

They've tried restructuring methods and nothing has worked, everything's failed. I think the reason is because we used to have a person named Mary who worked in our department and Mary was not the manager but she was under the manager and she organized everything at work. So everything is very consistent, she's very helpful. Kind like if you asked a question Mary was To answer it, when Mary move to different apartment, like she's worked there for five years. Everything just collapsed. They had to take why I am sorry. They had to have two people replace her instead of just her doing the job. The two people had different answers for things, different opinions, different personalities. And honestly, the whole place just collapsed because they didn't have the knowledge that she had, and that's what they needed. They were put into soon. and then they're going to recharge her our department again and divide us into teams which is just going to cause more hassle because any of three people fighting instead of two"

Never took him off the team or anything but I typically react with anger, but I also voice my feelings until them and especially this, with this misogynist I told him. Look, you are in a workplace, you were not being professional. You're being disgusting.

My desk was cluttered, but I had just had a week off with my children who were sick. And when I came back, I just had all my work on that. I had done over the week while I was off on my table. And usually, that's not very typical of me. Usually, I am a clean person. I tend to be Erotic, about cleaning. And it was just a very hard situation."

One of my strengths is that I'm a fast learner. I don't have a hard time being thrown into a new situation and having to learn something on the spot, I've always been kind of a fast learner. So that's something that has been to my advantage when I'm new at a company or taking on a new role, or if there's change. Happening within the organization, one of the downsides that is that I tend to get a little impatient. Sometimes I feel like I could work really fast sometimes and it's not that I rushed through my work, sometimes I can just get into the Zone. I don't talk a lot while I'm working. So when I'm really, really focused and I kind of get into the flow of things, I can work pretty swiftly and that's great. If I'm working for myself, If there are other team members or any other issues or unexpected things that happen, I tend to get a little impatient. I try to encourage other people to work at my Pace instead of trying to slow down. So that's something that I've been trying to work on recently. Another strength that I have is I like to teach. So orienting new people and a job is something that I enjoy doing. I like to look out for people that are just starting out and trying to find their way around the organization or around the office. It's just kind of in my own experience working as a new employee ivic, I've been offered a lot of hospitality from some managers and I've never forgotten that so I'm always really considerate and friendly to new people and I'm always willing to help show them around one of the downsides. It's said that is sometimes it cuts into the time that I need to be spending on my own work. It's very easy for me to offer to help somebody or to just say yes to something that's come up unexpectedly and then at the last minute, I might find that the things that I still have to get. Done aren't going to get done in time. So I've had to learn how to say no to saying yes. Our yeah, that's about it."

I don't try to hide it, but I definitely try to use it in a balanced in balance while I'm working but I love to use humor. I love to make people laugh. I'm not silly, but I I just enjoy levity in general. I could I love making people laugh and smile and also when I said that, my friends would say I'm considerate, I am always looking for out for other people. I stick up for other people. I'm willing to lend a hand. If somebody needs help, I'm willing to offer, help even if they don't want to ask her if they can't ask. And yeah they would describe me also as somebody that is independent somebody that can take care of themselves just because I've been that way for a very long time. I like the the idea of coming up with a plan and following through with it on my own I've been in a lot of situations where I have to think on my feet by myself. So I've developed a sense of Independence that I'm really comfortable with. And that's a little hard for me to ask for help. My friends will tell you that too. I could be so independent that I am not accepting of other people's help. I only want to help other people, and when I need help it's not, it's not very easy for me to say. Yes, that's about it."

It usually just comes down to, right? And wrong, I try to live my life Guided by and by a moral compass. I listened to my conscience. So a lot of decisions that I make usually just come down to well, what's right or what's best? And, you know, sometimes the best Thing is not always the cheapest thing or the most time-efficient thing. So, I understand that when I have to make a decision decision, that is the for the best of some sort, there might be a sacrifice made. So in my career early on, I did make some decisions about saying no to certain jobs that I knew would be very lucrative, but would ultimately, I'd end up on a different path than what I knew I was called to be on. And you know that's affected me too because I've had to make a lifestyle out of, you know, managing a budget that is according to what I'm willing to do for money, you won't see me. Just go out there and do anything to make a big paycheck. I really want to make sure that the work that I do is worth it and then I can sleep well at night knowing that I've done the right thing. So I'm never really too concerned about status or money because in my life it's usually just me. Morality is Paramount."

And usually the thing that I tend to do when I'm around a new group, is to observe, I'm usually very quiet when I'm in a new place or a new setting. And it's not because I'm shy, but it's because I want to sit back and just take in what's going on around me before I decide how I'm going to interact. A new team, a new set of people usually means noon, Norm's new likes and dislikes. So before I'm not going to walk in, I'm not going to, I'm not going to walk into a room and then just start telling jokes any kind of jokes that I want to tell. Or any kind of stories that I want to tell or behave. However, I want to, I I read the room, I get a feel for the people that are around, I get a feel for what's, you know, as the group what is expected of us, in terms of behavior. And what the group goal is like, why why are we meeting and And as a team, what are we doing? So my first step is always to I'll introduce myself but then I tend to just sit back and I kind of eyeball the room, I try to get a feel for the people that are in it and then I'll start to open up and interact with people once I kind of know what, I want to, what I want to offer to the group."

I just had a job you know I'm doing administrative work but the work was still kind of new to me. I was still learning and I was still considered to be in training and there was a lot to learn. This was also during the pandemic. So I was on a new team in a new situation during the pandemic and it there was just so much to focus on during that time. So I'm at this new job where I'm trying to learn and like I've mentioned in some earlier segments that I'm I'm a pretty independent worker. I can work by myself pretty comfortably and in this one office I had a co-worker that lived to talk. She if she could talk all day she would. But it was very, very distracting for me. A lot of my work involved transcribing and proofreading which takes a lot of focus and like I said it was a pretty stressful year to begin with and it took a lot of effort on my part to to politely communicate to her that. She talks too much and she's distracting me while I'm working and that I'm never going to engage with her as much as she's wanting. And for the entire time that I was working in the office, she never once toned it down. That was just something about her. It was personal, but then it was also personal about me too. I'm just not a chatty person while I'm talking. So that was a not the most comfortable situation. It was a pretty annoying time."

And one time that stands out to me, particularly was when I worked in an office for a business that was on a farm. So it was on a piece of land where people were actually doing farm work. But I like, I said, I worked in the office. So I worked inside, I worked in the air conditioning. I did a lot of stuff that required high levels of organization because I was doing paperwork for this business, and I was helping to organize and prepare their products that they sell. So my end of the job, not unlike the farmers that were there, required me having to be very consistent every day. But the people that worked on the farm, their work changes every day. It changes with the weather changes with the seasons and that meant the spaces that we shared as co-workers. Could be very unpredictable and very messy. I would often maybe take a break and stop doing something, and then come back to it later. And find that my work has been messed up or moved or I can't even find it at all. Working in that office was hard for me because I never was able to do my best work because there was always something related to the workspace. That was an obstacle for me, in terms of being. Well, organized, it was just, it was a messy place. It was a dirty job but I stuck it out."

I prefer to work with spreadsheets and as a manager, even though I oversee, I still like to be in the details. I need to know exactly what I am overseeing, whether it be payroll purchasing or the grants I'm working on. Another strength is a, my ability to take a look to collaborate with coworkers, I am very easy to work with. I don't have an ego. So, if someone disagrees, especially a direct report I robbed, I'll say, okay, I won't bring it up again. A weakness would be public speaking, a very concise, a little too concise, sometimes looked as terse and public, speaking. I really stick to the facts and I'm not, I don't elaborate very well. Well, as you can probably tell I can probably go on for about 30 seconds more, but definitely if it was a 5 minute or 10 minute presentation I would need Powerpoints and I do that, I try to work on on my on my speaking skills."

When we have deadlines, then I am that, I'm very serious. It also describe me as as trustworthy as well. I already said that. Yes.

I applied for a lower position because I was moving to a new state and I didn't think I was ready to to work as an administrator yet but the person that I applied to urge me to to apply for the administrator position and I did I study a lot more. What was necessary for the school district and I have Applied and I interviewed I got the roll and I'm excelling in it and that was a big difference in compensation and status as well. It's different being a manager as opposed to a staff member. Typically, I like to go, I too like the train first and then advance. For this, I went straight for the the manager role and so far, it's working out very well."

I didn't say anything at meetings, maybe because it was, umm, and not in person that made. That was a difference. But, but I definitely will. I need to need time to do understand the culture typically, I also ask more questions than usual when I want to enter a new team instead of instead of speaking instead of answering questions."

Like what, how can they have a can help themselves? So, I just take a breath. I waited out, I try to get along with them, but I'm nicer to them. When that when that happens."

I'm working on a bigger more important task. So I prefer that point to do anything, piecemeal and multitask, let's say there's a spreadsheet and working on with 300 lives. I'll do 100 add time 100 and then I'll work on something else. Then go back to the first spreadsheet, the next 100 and then go back to the other thing and that usually works very well."

I'm very reliable, I'm very dedicated to the job, and so this leads me to getting everything I need done. I'm very ambitious. I'm very driven at the same time. Some of the weaknesses and they coincide with with some of those is I can be detail oriented to a fault where I get stuck on on the small details. That I may not see the big picture, so I get very bogged down. I'm very hard on myself. And sometimes I won't want to ask questions for fear of, you know, not knowing or feeling dumb. So this leads me to maybe trying to figure out on my own. It may take me a while or too long or ended up doing something wrong. This is a kind of broken that habit though, but I would say that was mainly my main weakness right there and I can also be a perfectionist, so it's something that can easily be done. You know, a couple of things may not be the best, but I can maybe focus on trying to be too perfect and it can bog down stuff or you know, stuff that has a flow to it, where I need my Work done and then I pass it off or it gets stuck with me too much because I'm I'm trying to be too perfect."

I'm not going to put you off in and I typically make time for anybody. D, you know, who needs it? I'm very good at prioritizing, so I will fit you in. You know, when I can, obviously, we're adults were busy. Another thing they would describe me as is, I'm typically very outgoing of a very loving person and sometimes to a fault where I give too much of myself to people. I can be maybe too nice to understanding to giving but, you know, that's just how I am. I would say my His friend would also describe me as very reliable, very dependable.

If I say I'm gonna do something I ended up doing it with without needing to be asked, you know, plenty of times you may have to follow up once with me at may have lost track of it. I didn't forget to do it this. I put it a little on the back burner and I would say another thing that typically, I wear my heart on my sleeve, so to speak, I can be kind of an emotional person and I take a lot of stuff to heart. You know, stuff can, you know, get to me. I can get kind of frustrated if if something's you know, not going right. You know, right away. I ended up getting through it. But, you know, I can get kind of flustered."

And that was a big professional decision for me because while yes, it is more status and more money. It also comes with a lot more responsibility, maybe a bigger failure rate, because you are now managing people, you, you know, you have more on your shoulders and besides just, you know, as an insurance agent just me focusing on my work mine alone. I'm not really worried about the performance of my other teammates as long as I get my stuff done. Now the performance of my team below. Me my subordinates now becomes my responsibility and I'm Dove on the hook for their performance. So that was a saw how it typically behave in, you know, decisions where I decide to go for, you know, the next step. If people think it's easy, just to take that next step into, you know, go into management are going, you know, to get the promotions because with their promotions while yes, you get the more money and more status. Is be, it does come with a lot more responsibility, and it can be added stress, maybe some longer working hours. So I usually handle it by, you know, being as detail-oriented as I can making the decision war with my mind and my heart. But you know, I kind of maybe 70/30 mine versus harp, it still needs to be what my heart wants to do but also need to weigh all my options. Weigh. Exactly. You know the benefits that are going to come versus the the pros and cons of it but that's how always react in these decision-making processes."

I like to, you know, assess where I fit in, maybe who I fit in with the most, and maybe gravitate towards them what my place is going to be in this team. People can see it as being a little timid but I just like to absorb everything first First and and why that is is so I don't overstep my boundaries as one thing because a lot of teams do have a structure to have a hierarchy and I don't want to overstep anything be that new person who comes in and it's maybe too flamboyant, too cocky wants to do things you know their way. They'll yes I am very observant as well. I want to observe and I'm very observant and I can be kind of a little quiet so I'm not going to Come in full force that will come over. Time, I tend to open up as time goes on. But at the beginning, I'm very observant with how everybody interacts with one another, I like to build trust with people. I want to see who I can build trust with because on any team you can't put full trust in everybody. And I think while you can trust everybody to a certain extent I want to learn who's the most Dependable, who's the most reliable. Who do I need to Ally myself? Myself with, if you can Ally yourself with everyone. So in as time goes on then you know I'll become more open more independent but I like to lean on my team when I get there. So I kind of defer to them more often than not in the beginning and typically I will let her think play out organically. I don't want to force the issue of anything. I don't want to try to fit in and try too hard. I still Want to be myself at the end of the day."

I would say just people who can't stay on time, they promise you something, and then it's not delivered on time. So you have to feel like you're pestering them. And going to them, I become very frustrated and I can become very ornery, and just, I won't become mean and, you know, out, right. But, you know, like that but for me I'm punctuality and being on time, staying on track is a is a big thing for me. And that's what I like to do. And this goes in work or personal life. If somebody says they're going to do something and then they don't do it, I can lose trust in this person. I kind of shy away from them. You know, I'm not going to get angry, but I will become very annoyed with you. You'll be able to you'll be able to see it. We would hear it and that's me showing you. My displeasure is, you know, not following through with what you say, you are, it's, you know, everybody's an adult. If you're say, you're going to do something, you know, you should you should do it and in the Work World, especially when deadlines or key, I need you to do, what you say you're going to do and not only that, but when you say you're going to do it. So if I need something by today or, you know, tomorrow and it comes that time and you've made no communication. Yeah, that's what I'm going to become. Kind of, I can become kind of passive aggressive in a way to as I don't want to become outright mean, but I'll start to maybe use some all caps in emails or some passive aggressive language. And that's me showing you much as Pleasures. Hopefully, you can pick up on those cues and try to change that over time."

I take pride in being organized, in my personal and work life, I need to know where everything is. It doesn't matter if it may be and it doesn't even it's not even an organized. Most most stuff is very organized and this goes for my physical workspace as well as my virtual workspace light, how more organized on my computer and where everything is everything He's in folders. Everything is where I know exactly where it is to where if I need an item, I can go find it pretty quickly and I just can't work or be around a messy environment personal or work. This is, we're talking about work-related. Yeah, this is not typical of me at all and it makes me feel more comfortable in my work. Space is organized, virtually and physically. I'm happier. And I get more stuff done and I become very anxious when stuff is out of order when stuff is not organized. So in this helps me in my day-to-day staying organized as long as you as long as I stay organized from the jump and keep up with it. I never have to really clean up. Its when stuff gets out of control and it just be it, just piles up, you know, that's where you can lose control over, you know, hot toddy, your workspace. This but me being organized is a especially in my line of work. It's a need you need to be organized.

But also stay in mind of all of the steps that need to be taken to reach that larger goal. I think having both of those in mind really helps me with any sort of work that I do. Weaknesses, I would say."

I do not let things slip, which most of the time is a really good thing. Although it certainly has its downsides to. They would say that generally, I am very enthusiastic and optimistic. I always go into a situation expecting the best while preparing for the worst. I really keep both of those things in mind in anything that I do. They might also say, let's see, I tend to be very organized. I'm not naturally, I don't naturally have a great memory so to help compensate for that. I take a lot of notes constantly. My friends are very used to me pulling out my phone and taking a note, even if it's something like oh you should watch this TV show or read this book or whatever. I know I'm going to forget. So I always write it down and have a process for making sure that I hold onto all of those things. And remember anything that I might want to know in the future"

So for my entire career, I've worked for nonprofits which are somewhat Infamous for not necessarily paying very much money. But it's really important to me because the work is important, and I can see how valuable it is what I'm doing, and how I'm able to actually affect other people's lives. So, that personal fulfillment factor is really important to me. That said, Said, there has been a bit of a range in my life when I started out, fresh out of college, I was happy to work jobs where I worked? 20 hours a day, every day and got paid pittance as I got a bit older and have a family. Then I care about more about at least making enough money that it can be relatively stable. And I don't burn out that was a lesson that I had to learn fairly early in my career because typically, I will pour my whole self into whatever my role Liz. So it's also important for me that I need to keep the big picture in mind and not burn out on the short-term. But to make sure that I am making a decision that I can handle long-term and that can be stable."

I want to learn who all of those people are what they bring to the table, both personality-wise. Some people just prefer to work certain ways. But then also, in terms of their institutional knowledge, in terms of their background, what they do, for the organization, all of those things I want to learn. I'm there to learn, there's an existing team that's already there. So it's important to me. To understand the current lay of the land. Before I try to jump in and change everything. I want to understand what my role is on its own, but also how it affects other people, how it affects the team and then the company as a whole. So I think it's important to listen a lot and part of that also is speaking up enough that other people get to understand me as well. Just as I'm learning my place in the team. The rest of the team needs to learn my place as well. And to see how I can help them and fit into that bigger picture that we're all working towards."

I understand that everyone has things going on. Everyone has off days. Typically I assume that people have good intentions. I don't think anyone's ever trying to be annoying. So usually, in those situations, if someone annoys me, I just kind of accept it move on, there's no, usually, there's no point in engaging with it. I tend to be fairly. I guess focus on the bigger picture and if someone's being annoying that day it's not really that big, a deal that said it would be different if it's a case where someone is annoying me because they're not following procedures, or they're not listening to what I'm saying or they're affecting customers or something like that. If it's truly affecting the job or the company or what were there to do. And that case, then I would say something, I would try to wait until maybe it's a calmer moment if someone is upset sometimes they don't always receive. That very well unless it's an emergency where I would have to jump in. So typically, I would wait until everyone's in a calmer state of mind and then I would say, hey, this is a problem, we need to do X, so that y happens and try to spell it out as calmly as possible and not make it an emotional thing. There are plenty of personalities that just don't get along very well just rub each other the wrong way. But in a work situation, it's really important that everyone is able to Work together. Those little annoyances are just not that important, and the long term, and we have to find ways to work productively together."

There might be piles of papers or, I don't know pens everywhere as. But I always know what's there, it might be difficult for someone else to be trying to find something. A particular document maybe without asking me in that sense, I can be not very organized but I tend to be extremely organized on my computer when it comes to digital files and any physical. All documents. I almost always scan and put into my computer and I have my own system for what works for me and that is extremely organized. So while generally, I am less organized when it comes to a physical workspace in general overall when it comes to actually doing my work in the important documents or notes or things that I need to keep in mind, typically I am extremely organized when it comes to those things."

Speaking directly from experience I would say my strengths are that I'm very focused on my on the work at hand. So if you give me a task, I will do those tasks and I will just be heavy heavy set on completing those tasks. Some weaknesses. I would say is that I'm very focused on my work so I don't really We focus on a lot of other stuff including my personal life. So it's mainly just work work work. So that is also a strength and a weakness. But I would say in the middle strength is also that I am a very good teammate or a communicator. So if you give me a task, I will do that. I would also, I'm also willing to give criticism and also take criticism. So if I need some help or I need something, That needs to be changed in something that I'm doing. I will definitely do that. So I guess another I guess another weakness I would say is that I feel that if you don't give me a task, I will just not do anything. So you just have to give me a task. That's like my weakness.

My friends would describe me as funny very much. Very much in to make my friends happy. Making my friends laugh even if you know, even if they're down, or if they're like, you know, they don't really want to talk, I'll try to make them up to be more positive about the situation.

I wouldn't like you know to go wild out there, just try to play it safe just so I can, you know, look good on my resume just so people could actually hire me. Why? Do you think that is just so because no one I would think in general, no one would like try to hire someone with a without their kind of experience in life.

Try to See what tasks tried to delegate. What tasks you have to do when within that team in order to get a good grade? So You know, I would usually act nice. If I, you know if we really need to get through this task and you know, I would definitely try to introduce myself. Try to do the best that I can to help each other out.

So I would try to just keep calm carry on try to tell them what they did wrong and you know say like you really can't do that. It's very impolite for me for you to do that.

So I would just try to see What I had to do within within my my, you know, my line of work. Why do I think that is because they were new. They were a new company that was established three years ago and they were still slightly understaffed. So I would say it was because of that I would also say because my My supervisor was still busy doing all the tasks because they were playing, they were put in double duty as my supervisor and also focusing on other departments.

I made that could affect my status or how much money I make would be not professional. I would say but having kids and I chose to Put everything on hold and not have a job right now. This decision definitely came with consequences as the professional aspect of that and I've been thinking of things to do, and Work at home and things like that. It actually the plus side made me very inventive on how to make money and things I could do for my future. So I would say it was definitely, there was definitely a plus side and a negative side to it both professionally and on a personal level."

But I'm not always working with the teacher, I'm more more or less working with a new group of people at my kids school. It's volunteer work. And when, how do I behave? When I join new people is I'm a little standoffish, but when I'm asked a question, I definitely open up when I say standoffish, I mean, I'm getting to know them. By people watching, you could say, filling them out and kind of seeing where I can join in and where I can fit in to. To the new group. So I would say. I behaved, very proper, very quiet, very polite, and a little shy, and it's just all because I want to fill them out first, and then kind of see where my placement can be on, a new team, what my goals will be my job on the new team and any way that I can help."

It would annoy me that when I wanted a break people act like they didn't have the time to come give me 10 minutes or, you know, replace me just for a few minutes. How do I react when someone is annoying me while typically I don't do anything. I don't want to start anything. I don't want to make anything stand out or awkward or any tension. So if somebody is annoying me, I don't do anything. I just kind of remember that as a well a little bit of a losing trust type of filling is only thing I could say but they could easily gain that trust back to me if if anything but Yeah, I just I just brush it off when someone annoys me."

I'm very organized. I wouldn't like my workspace to be dirty or cluttered or anything. I did work at a job before that it was retelling. There was hangers Everywhere and clothes. And just stuff everywhere and I was very young and I will always think that job they taught me that you sometimes have to make a mess before you get organized. What I mean by that is there would be clothes everywhere and hangers and paperwork and you learn that you just can't work like that. So what you do is first of all, pick things up off the ground is a good. Art organized piles of where things belong. I would put all the hangers in the bin or hang them up nicely and sort things out by the department that they belong in. So I do think that job forever because they taught me to be organized and my own system on where to start."

So I had to raise them to wear other similar freelance marketers in my field were, and some people didn't appreciate that as much, and they didn't quite understand. So I have to, you know, which I, I understand that, but I needed to kind of Explain to them, why. And the situation and I lost some business because of it and I feel like that's a bit of, you know, how it can affect my status. But I feel like Overall in the long run, it worked out better for me.

I'm very upfront and open and I'm very social. So I haven't had an issue with having to deal with, you know, negative emotions, I guess I could say. And so I just, I get along with everybody. So it's easy for me to just kind of just fit in and I have to worry about, you know, well what is this person think about me? Because I just my mind doesn't work like that. I just I just get along with people, I can make my small talk and then I do the job. That's it's really what it comes down to is just making sure the job's done.

So I could potentially bring new ideas to the table. but, I'm also very committed when I am able to start working on a task. I know, That I'm usually in it until it's done. As far as my weaknesses go. I would say that I do have some difficulty. Starting on tasks. It's usually just getting started on tasks that I have difficulty with actually completing it is not a problem.Another problem that I have is, you know, sometimes sometimes it's a matter of confidence. I don't exactly have the best confidence sometimes but then also just depends on what the, what the task at hand is generally speaking, I would say that, My weakness is are more like minor nuisances than anything."

That I'm also very, I'm very funny. You know I know how to tell a joke or two or at the very least I know how to make people laugh. But more than anything I would say that. My friends think of me as a reliable person, whether it's, you know, they ask me for a favor or they need, you know, they need some money like you know, like it just a little I guess alone, what you say, or more like they're borrowing at or just having someone to be there to listen to them when they're going through. You know, something bad. I'm, I would consider myself to be a very good listener. And my best friend would probably agree with me.They might also describe me as a social butterfly to some degree.

I would say that most of the time I'm very rational I try to approach the situation calmly and determine what my best course of action would be because While the, I mean, there are things that are at stake in these types of situations. I should take it seriously but usually I try to just go with options that seem the most natural or the most comfortable, to me, I don't want to force myself to do something that would make the aftermath more difficult for me. Or, you know, uncomfortable or anything like that. There are sometimes though where I've been really stressed and I don't handle it so well, but I feel like that's normal because we're all human, but I feel like for the most part of the reason why I try to approach these situations calmly as because I feel as though, There really isn't a better way to handle it. Because panicking isn't really going to make the situation better but, you know, being upset won't improve it. I just need to Stay calm and think rationally. Because in the end, What's best for me?

I guess I would say afraid for lack of better, terms of being, you know, the weakest member of the group or the weakest link as some might say. And I think really that just comes from me, wanting to perform well and wanting to impress the other members of my group, you know, my peers. I don't really think there is much reason behind it. Other than that I mean I just want to do well I want to make sure I'm respected and I don't want anyone to think I'm not pulling my weight or think that I'm pulling unit or that I'm holding them back or anything like that.

I don't really like the stress that comes with confronting people and talking through problems, you know, at least when I'm upset, I would rather have some time to myself, too. Feel the way that I feel about things and maybe sort my thoughts and then see if I can re approach the problem and the person and you know, involved and see if maybe we could come to an understanding about what happened or if that's not possible, the see how I would like to see how we could avoid such a situation happening again in the future.but yeah, I think part of that is because I don't like confrontation, I would rather You know, let the mood settle down first.

And so I would say it's somewhat typical of my workspace to not be. super organized and I think that's really because I feel I don't I don't need a lot of personal organization to perform my duties or, you know, perform my tasks for the day or even just any of my own leisurely activities during my, you know, off time. I'm not someone who feels like they depend on organization and don't get me wrong, organ organization is good. It is very important. I just don't personally feel that. I need it to a great capacity in my own personal workspace and I think that's okay. I mean that's what works for me. Of course, in a more professional environment. I would obviously take organization even more seriously and keep my workspace there. Or as organized as I possibly could at all times. But in my own personal workspace, I would rather go with Comfort because that because that Comfort allows me to work better because I can focus Less on organization and focus more on the work and tasks that I have a hand."

That people I can get this buying these individuals and as far as my weaknesses, I feel like I work a little too hard and I am a little too more accessible to my resources which gives me less time to do the work that I need to do for my job. So I think these weaknesses are areas that I want to learn and improve on so they can eventually become strains throughout my career. Also, I think one of my other weaknesses is, you know, not always completing things on time. I am someone who likes to take time and do my work.

I mean, they didn't really teach me much at the beginning, you know, how to figure out everything myself. So I feel like that was very disorganized as well, but they were new company and they were learning as well. So, but yes, whenever that happens in generally takes more time to figure out what's going on that actually doing the work. I feel like"

I am bubbly, I love to smile. So I'm always optimistic and there's very few days that get me down. One of my weaknesses is that sometimes I like to take on too much stuff, and what I mean by that is that I'm, I Lee want to be friendly. And so, somebody would be like, how could you help me out with this? Yes, I can help you out with that and then another person would come up to me. Hey, could you help me out with the? Yes, I can help you out and I need to learn more boundaries and to not be so readily agreeable to all these different things. I love being a team player, but sometimes I just need to focus upon my own self."

I also really, really love to talk and to have adventures and that's actually kind of how I learned. Most of the things on the job is that I'm willing to learn just about anything. I love looking for opportunities where I can. I can explore new things. I'm also really a positive person and can befriend just about anybody and so, my best friend would would describe me as adventurous helpful honest and really kind of outgoing. And like I said, I'm always willing to learn just about anything. And I actually actively look for learning opportunities just to get to know different processes in the workplace."

I usually have a pro and con list and I go through and analyze every single pro and con. And if the pros outweigh the cons then I'm going to go for it. I'm going to do it. I think that in the majority of my professional career, I always strive to always better myself to learn more. And become readily available for the team. So I'm always wanting to learn more and to actually know just a little bit about everything so that if somebody is to call in sick or something, I would be able to handle it. The other thing too is that I really try to be calm under stress and I I'm always analyzing how I interact with those. Those around me and with the situation at hand. So I always feel like it's a good decision to always think of a pro and con list."

And usually, you know how you get when you are going through the office on the first time, and you're like, oh here's this person in this person, you're just like, you're overwhelmed. But I always try to take a minute to one learn somebody's name and also look around their office to see what kind of pictures they have up. You can tell a lot from Buddy, if they have like a dog picture or a family picture of a vacation and you can kind of make a conversation about that. And so that's what I usually do is I just always get introduced to people and then always try to remember their names and it's always happy. Like the people are always happy that you remember their name and a little bit of something because most people, they're so overwhelmed their first few days. That just the actually remember, somebody's name shows. That you're putting in the effort and the reason why I do that is because I'm going to be working with them for a long time and so I feel like I should get to know them before the real processes of the job actually it kind of starts way and you down so that's why I do it."

However, I have had an occasion when I had a co-worker spy on me through the camera system, and I really did not like that. And I felt that it was like a violation of my privacy. Even though I knew that there was a camera up in the corner, but then to have him, call me. And then was like, oh, what did you say to this customer? I was just like, whoa, that is really Really weird. And like I said, I felt like I couldn't ever relax at that job because he was constantly watching me through the camera and I actually spoke to the owners about it and I said, you know, there's really no reason for him to have access to the camera, is there. Something we could do? And we actually came up with a plan that we would change the passwords and he could not use that the camera outside of work. So you think I said, Usually, I tend not to get too annoyed, but there are certain things that will make me go. Hmm, maybe that's not a right thing to do for another person."

I have a place for everything and everything in its place, I sit there and have files and I also have notes and lists. And so I'm very, very organized to be not organized. Means somebody probably sat at my desk, trying to find something and had messed up my system that I had for organization. Typically, I just kind of Go where I can and what I mean by that is so if somebody hands me something important to do all work on that and set aside something else. But I'll put it to the left and I also organize my emails into categories. And so that's why I just feel that once you're organized, you can better start and see what needs to be. Get done. You can prioritize everything I also. So I'm always kind of, pretty much always organized. I'm rarely if ever not organized,"

I'm trying to do my video. Can you please go in there with that act? Mom."

So I don't know that my best friend would say all that about me but likely likely she would because if That I've worked with for a long time. So she knows. She knows that that's something that I love to do."

Typically the managers and supervisors are looking at how you perform overall. So I don't know that I would change the way I act at all. And I guess that's the reason why because everything you do professionally could affect you in some way negative or positive. So yeah, I mean I always try to behave the same way regardless of the situation regardless of how stressed I am or what's going on in my personal life or work. I try to maintain a calm demeanor and just make the best decisions for myself and the company and my co-workers and everybody around me and I don't Think of it specific decisions affecting how much money I make or not."

I've had a lot of experiences joining meetings, meeting new people working with all different personality types. And so, how behave when I enter new team is pretty much the same way that I behaved or acted on my previous team or with the people that I previously worked with. because again, Why do I think that is? I don't think it really. I don't think it's necessary to change the way that you behave. Now, I will say, I think another one of my strengths is changing the way. The changing my Approach with certain people because there are so many different personality types and especially when you're in a leadership position. It's important to not speak to everyone the same way because for one have had a lot of experience with the new hires and And being a leader. For them and not, everybody's going to learn the same way and some people are fast. Learners, some people are a bit slower. Some people need you to go through everything with them. Some people are visual and it's important to change your behavior and how your approach with them to make sure that you help them the best way you can. And I think that's the same thing. When you join a new team of people, it's just learning all the different personality types that are out there that are on the The team and figuring out the best way to work with them but as far as my behavior who I am and that's not going to change regardless of who I'm working with."
5dc7870428e0d566b626bcb9_q5_c1_1672184695_2a6c0c7b-cc65-47a3-a384-590ab31ccb94,"I think working with so many different people, especially in a leadership shit position. There are certainly going to be tons. Were somewhat annoyed she because as I mentioned in the last question, there's so many different personality types out there in the world and some people just are not going to get along, but the important thing is to behave professionally and get a long enough to get the job done. One, if you've got to work with somebody. So I mean there's been plenty of times especially working with new hires. As I mentioned in the last question people that I don't want to use the word lazy, but didn't really seem to care about learning the job, but they had just That that I just got hired for. A lot of people get angry when there's something that they don't understand in, the job that I was a leader for for the new hires, it was a very difficult job, so I understand that but a lot of times when people get frustrated, they get mad and they kind of get annoyed or like kind of get an attitude with the people that are trying to help them and I just get that that's basic psychology. And so again I react pretty much Same way. I mean, I asked that calm and I changed my Approach with them and I try to reach them in a way that would be helpful to them. And now, I will say, obviously, if someone really annoys me, I'm not going to go out of my way to continue trying to help them. If they made it clear, they don't want the help. There's people that I've stayed in touch with that I trained in, you know, a few years later, I'm still their main source of contact. Even after they've moved out and moved on to other teams. And so I try to be as helpful as possible. But again like I don't necessarily go above and beyond for someone who has been really hateful or Roots me obviously. So I think that's the only thing that would change but otherwise I react pretty much the same way as anything else."
5dc7870428e0d566b626bcb9_q6_c1_1672184795_2a6c0c7b-cc65-47a3-a384-590ab31ccb94,"So, they're certainly been times when I work, I work space was not very organized, it's not typical of me because I enjoy being organized and when everything is chaotic. I just I don't like it. I found it difficult to work in but there has certainly been times where there's just so much going on. That I've just got random papers everywhere. You know, people are coming by handing me stuff, I've got Five or six projects I'm working on. And you know the phone is ringing that you mi are piling up all the things happen. So I mean that's some not typical but it definitely does happen. And why do I think that is? I guess that's why I just because sometimes things are a little bit overwhelming but typically I'm a huge fan of to-do lists and planners and at the end of every day, I look at what I need to do for the next day, I write it all down. And I'll make sure I get it done in between, you know, the runaround and the putting out fires here and there throughout the day. So yeah, and I try to get it back to as organized as possible as soon as I can."

And I'm Cooperative very team-oriented. I like to make sure that others understand that I'm on task and that we're working towards the goal that we're Supposed to be accomplishing for that day. At least, you know, my workplace. That's just how the things are structured. But it is, you know, can varied. So for weakness, I'd say I can be easily overwhelmed at times, that doesn't stop my ability to still work at a steady pace and rate, but you can see, you can visibly see it in my, you know, My parents are just. you know, I don't have a attitude necessarily like I said, you can just tell that I can be kind of a tad bit easily overwhelmed. But that's not really a weakness that stops me from still doing what I need to do. Like I said, so That's what I would say for for that question."
5dcb685070d51c8275d7bd54_q2_c1_1671654331_011bc03e-3d12-4706-89e9-17e8aabe55be,"so I think I don't have many friends just to begin with, but the few that I do have would describe me as nice nice guy, I'm kind of, you know, try to really make sure people are taking care of, especially my family. That's my main priorities. I don't you know, I'm not necessarily a people person but I people that I do know and I am close to I Really show affection towards But overall, I am certainly I'm certainly an introvert. I'm certainly someone that's to myself and don't like, you know, a ton of social interaction, but I'm still able to do so. If needed. So, Yeah, that that would be partially or partly how they describe me and there's a lot of other things and they may say, but overall, I'm a nice guy. So that's kind of how I would describe it. I believe they would describe me at least, so, I hope they would"

You know, making a ton of a ton of money. I just need enough to sustain myself. I barely my expenses are so limited and think and I'm thankful for that. So I'm, you know, I'm glad I haven't had to make such harsh decisions and that I've been able to, you know, such the keep the same job that I began works, you know, as a work-study employee and I just, you know, moved up in my school and just I've been at my school since as it facilities, I'm now manager. So, but how do you usually behave, I guess in, in these kind of situations though that I've had to be in I try to just keep a decent composure, not be so. Just not be so pressed for the money I guess you can say and that's because like I said I'm just a very content person. I don't, I mean obviously I am working towards wealth, I get you can say but that will be in my own time and I'll figure that out. Hopefully with, you know, the business ventures that I explore. So, what else? I was also raised, well, really well. I'm on my parents. My dad was a great father. My mom, we're still really, you know, very close. So that's kind of why my attitude is the way that it is. I guess, you can say."
5dcb685070d51c8275d7bd54_q4_c1_1671654663_011bc03e-3d12-4706-89e9-17e8aabe55be,"When I am put it, put with a new group of people or anything like that, I just try to make sure that the first thing is, I try to make sure I give off a decent first impression. If I can, you know, it's not always the easiest thing to do for myself, just because I'm not the most socially. I'm just not the most sociable person unfortunately. So I feel like people it takes a minute for people to really kind of understand me and just kind of see how you know I'm not just a An oddball. I'm definitely different. But I'm just I'm just kind of a Very hyper word person. And I'm kind of gone through a few different events that have caused me to be the way that I am, but I just try to make sure that I'm kind is kind as possible. That's kind of my way of, you know, getting a little bit more intimate, more intimate with people in breaking the ice a little bit better. And, like I said, why do you think that is? You know, that's like I said, because of some of the things that have happened to me in the past. I think have an impact on that. I feel like I used to be a lot more of a free free-spirited person and a lot clamor clammed up now, and I'm working towards. I'm working on that and towards just opening up in general, so yeah, that's why I think that is and, Also. People you know, they do tend to gravitate towards me you know despite that you know like what I just said it's I'm surprised by it. A lot of times myself I guess people don't necessarily notice it as much as I notice it. but I just try to make sure that I'm doing my job in whatever group that I'm a part of. And, you know, just ensure that we all succeed and and that I don't give off the wrong Vibe or impression, you know that people are thinking that, okay, I'll go and go."

I don't have to really interact with that many people. So, I mean, you know, I don't get into situations too often where I'm annoyed or, and just, you know, just disrupted by people. But if anything, my family, I'm involved with this with my family. If anything. So But you know, I don't, I'm very easygoing guy. I don't allow things to just overly frustrate me and just put me in a state of Payroll or just knowing like an annoyance. So and why do I think that is just the, my environment, my the people who have raised me my family, I mean And that's just kind of how I naturally have always been so. Yeah, and I mean, any situations, I'm usually the diffuser. I try to make sure that, you know, You know, whatever is being. I try to make sure it first. If it's a misunderstanding, I try to, you know, make sure things are understood. You know, at least on my side, I do the best that I can. So, yeah."

He wasn't deaf, he not my favorite but He needed to kind of, you know, after year to he started to definitely, not keep up with his position and his role as a supervisor and managing our team. So, You know, people would start to get hired and then the term, you know, people just leave and that was to do with just the operations and they they were just very mediocre and lackluster. Always felt like up until Chris, my boss now was moved up, so So, it wasn't necessarily my workspace, and my workspace is never really disorganized. I'm a very organized person and structure. I'm very structured off the alike. And again, that's just part of my nature. So Hopefully that answers that that side of the question. So yeah, I'm I'm not disorganized with the structure. I feel like I'm fairly What's another word to describe it? I don't know why. It seems that the words aren't coming to me but that that that that would be the answer to that question."

That I care about the welfare of animals above the welfare of people, though. I do care for people too. They would say, I might have a sarcastic sense of humor, but I do have a good sense of humor.

So and in such save situations, I would be Behave. Maybe a little more upbeat and gregarious and engaging than I usually am. I would you know, maintain eye contact little better and just try to maneuver my way around the conversation to convince someone to make a purchase because then I would profit off the shoes.

And I think, because I was around, you know, maybe slightly higher. Quality of people, it was easier to get along because they generally have higher sanity if someone has a good job. And so when I joined that job it was really easy to integrate with the group and maybe even stand out a little bit. Like so we all walked a lot it was big spacious restaurant and so as a fun thing I went to The dollar store and bought like 30 pedometers for everyone to wear and so we could all see how far we walked during our shift during our work shift. So So when I enter a new team, I'm apprehensive and a little quiet at first and, you know, got a size up the situation, and then I get more comfortable over time and I think that's why do I think that is, I think that's just a totally normal way to to Joint, too. Mmm. Yeah. To just to integrate into a new group because if you come on to confidently at first, you could seem a bit overbearing, a bit like a, you have a big ego like, you're trying to be controlling and dominant on your first day of work, maybe that's wrong, but if you're too sheepish and shy, you're not going to be able to be confident enough to engage the job and people properly."

And so my solution is just to ignore people really because there's if you just argue you're both just going to get worked up and that's going to solve nothing. So in order to keep my Energy and mood, and attitude, stable and positive. My reaction is just to ignore people and just treat them like they don't exist. Really, if I'm forced to communicate with them, I make it as little as possible. I am tight-lipped and I generally just try to keep it business like and formal. Only only talk when with them when it's absolutely necessary. And why do I think that is? I think it's just because everyone not everyone in life is going to get along, we all have our differences and so it's not necessarily that that person is a bad person, maybe it's just me and them don't Jive.

So I think in the beginning of that job, I was a little disorganized but it's I think it was because I mostly just hadn't formed to have it habit. Hadn't discovered really how Post men sort their mail and before delivery? So It's not very typical of me to be disorganized, especially at work. I really like organization. I don't, I don't leave things in a mess at work ever, and if I, if I might, I might in my my house in my room, you know, leave a slight mess, but I'm not ever completely just disheveled. So, I would say, that's pretty atypical of me to be disorganized at work. It's Like, with the Amazon thing, it's just a learning process. It was never intentional to be disorganized. But when I'm organized, I'm able to work a lot faster and feel a lot. I just feel cleaner in my head and that just that sense of hygiene just makes me feel about my workspace and about myself. So, Times that I was disorganized. Why do I think I was perhaps it could. It could also just be attributable to a bad day.

I naturally fall into that role and very good at it. People have a tendency to follow me as well. I also adapt very quickly. I can change. If the environment changes, it's a fast-paced environment. Moment and the nature of the job changes, I can change with it. I adapt very quickly. I'm a fast learner and, you know, so that helps me in leadership positions or management positions. I also any job that I've ever had, I try and do with integrity and do my best. Whether, you know, it was working in a retail shop or managing a call. Or anything like that. I tried to do it to the best of my ability with my Integrity, no matter what the job calls for. And I think that lends itself to the type of worker that I am and that's what makes me the greatest employee as far as weaknesses go. I have a tendency, I can be a little bit of a bleeding heart people. In a management position people have told me all kinds of SOB stories like their grandmother died so they need time off of work outside. You know what is given and the standard operation of procedures, but they have five grandmother's things like that. But I guess that's one of my biggest my biggest weakness is I can be overly compassionate."

I like to make people laugh, things of that nature. They would say I'm a pet lover and I'm artistic I can be a little bit flinty.

I'm a true friend Resolute, I'm there for the duration. Asian what? I make a good friend. When I make a friend there, typically, my friend for life and I have long-term friendships, not a lot, but long-term friendships, I don't care for fly-by-night, friends or social media friends. It's not really a friend in my book, but you know, I'm cordial to people like that but my real friends, they would describe me, you know, maybe 20 years ago, maybe a T.

We had metrics, we had to follow for, for example. Like people would have to get, let's say, just for example sake, like 20 transfers onto make a hundred dollar, bonus, something like that.

And by the time, by the time, it was time to log out at the end of the day, they wouldn't make their bonus and I really felt bad because there were certain people that I knew that tried very, very hard. They were trying to learn this system. Learn the routine, learn everything they could, they were making their best effort. And so, I felt very badly. So, I would give up my transfer money so that they could make their bonus money, I would give up. All of my transfers or ask my upper management if I could give up one or two of mine so that they could make their bonus money, you know, just to know that I recognized. So they would know that I recognize their efforts and things like that. And why I think that is is because, you know, like, I'm very loyal to people, they worked hard. They were on my team, I was the team lead and I wanted to make sure that That they knew that I was going out of my way to recognize that they were working hard and it's so that's, that's why I did that. It was it was more worthwhile to me to give up a few dollars for them to bonus because I felt like that would Inspire their loyalty and their hard work in the future. If I could make somewhat of a small gesture on my part,"

Why do you think that is? So iíve had to change teams multiple times. Not only is it team leader, but as a crew member and what I try to do real quickly is assess people's personalities. If there's, you know, Great people, if there's people that are just they're not really. I try and assess different people's personality types because I want to know, you know, they don't know me either. So I'm trying to assess how I'm going to interact with different personality types and it depends on the size of the team, you know, from my personal experience, I've worked with teams in the size of 10 to 15 typically on average and just because I've been a crew member and a team leader. The reason I think that is is because, you know, I want to know how I'm going to interact with people in the future if I'm on a crew and You know, we're all the same. Okay, we're all employees. I'm not a team leader at this point, then I do apologize for that, pop up. Then I want to know, you know, if I'm going to be a team lead in the future, how we're going to work together or if they're going to take direction from me at that point. Also, when I enter a new team, you know, I want to know. How they're going to behave if they're going to show up for work, was a huge thing for me, I have experienced that before. So those are usually issues for me. Normally, I also, you know, when it's a new team depending on, you know, say you're going through a training module or something. If it takes if it's only a week you know, I will try and participate. If it's a participation type of like a zoom or a Skype or something like that but if it's longer than that like it is weeks-long like type of a training on a crew, I will normally sit back and watch To learn how people behave, who's interacting and things like that for maybe, you know, 34 days up to a week, something like that. And I just do that to assess people's other personality types and how I can interact with them. Maybe now on that team or in the future."
5dd5bde832699257cc9a2fef_q5_c1_1671661789_583e0168-3903-4d22-8cc0-ee751cd43e5b,"So question number five, think of situations when someone annoyed you, how do I usually react in the situation part one. And why do I think that is? So you know I've worked on large groups of people before so you know I will follow the chain of command if and when at all possible, if somebody annoys me usually I try and direct if it is possible, sometimes it's not always. I will try and address that situation with that individual first and say, hey look, I feel this way because of this situation, something like that, that doesn't always work and I have been in this situation multiple times actually. And so then, you know, you just try and go through the chain of command as best you can. And, you know, if worse comes to worse, you have to go to HR or some type of work mediation and things like That and the reason that I behave that way is because the reality is situation, is when, you know, you work in life, sometimes you have to work with large numbers of people. Odds are, you're not going to get along with everybody. Like if you meet these people on the street they're not always you wouldn't make friends with them. You just have to co-exist basically. So I mean that's what you have to do and you have to understand how To behave in such a manner in a work environment and sometimes it's awful, you have to go through it but it is it's a necessary skill. When you are in a work environment for sure."
5dd5bde832699257cc9a2fef_q6_c1_1671661978_583e0168-3903-4d22-8cc0-ee751cd43e5b,"So, question number six is think of situations when your work, or work space. Were not very organized. And part one, how typical is that of you? And why do you think that is? I can tell you right now, I am in my, I work from home. I work from home for a very long time. My workspace is unorganized right now. I kind of became a Dumping Ground because I am in between jobs and I have been for the last two and a half weeks. So, I just kind of ignored this space because I haven't been working and, you know, it's just kind of a catch-all junk mail, you know, little things. I'm a little table, a step stool laptop table, top bed thingy, like a tray, things like that. Like I said, it became a catch-all because I'm not working. Now, typically, when I am working, that is the reason why. But that is not typical of me when I'm working. I love to be completely organized. I cannot stand any extra stuff in my office space. This space, that I have personally, is basically a dedicated space. There is a bookshelf behind me, I'm sure, which you can see, I have a file cabinet to my left, an organization or uh, I'm sorry at file cabinet to my right and organization table for papers. I had to, I did have a lot of papers that I had to organize or kept organized, notes, scripts, things and whatnot over there. Stacks of printer, paper, things like that. I don't like a lot of clutter. That way I am distraction-free, I can stay focused on what I need to do and that's what makes me money. So that is the most important function of this entire room. And I like to keep it that way. I can't stand dust either. So I'm constantly dusting my office as well, and that's just, that's just a part of who I am. I think if there's a lot of clutter, it creates chaos in distractions when you have a job. And that is your workspace. I think it's important to whatever is around you needs to be job-related and not, you know, I don't want to be reading, love letters or junk. Email, or whatever things like that. So that's just how I react in that."

However, in some organizations honesty is seen, as I mean some organizations just want you to be a yes, person just waiting to follow along and I have gotten into trouble for being too honest. You know. I think part of that is a cultural thing, I'm Jewish. And so there's not a lot of beating around the bush and I think yeah, a lot of people just sort of expect To be told what they want to hear and it is. A problem. But I think that where it's helpful is that, you know, it's words helpful is that, you know, it provides people with a real sort ofLike a real time."

And so that often affects me, negatively like defects affects my decision-making - Lee. I think that I really worry about my position in general in society, I'm disabled. And so I feel more like my employment is always more tenuous, I feel like, yeah, so I feel like I'm anxious. I make sometimes emotional decisions. I make poor decisions when a lot is on the line. Because yeah, I just feel far more vulnerable I think than my colleagues. Also you know I started my career later in life. So I feel like not as valuable as my colleagues. Yeah, I don't know. Also I just feel like in corporate. I'm not accustomed corporate culture. I don't really like it. I think it's really Reductive I think it's really false. It's a really uncomfortable place for me to be and I'm not overly focused on achievement and money. I just don't care that much. Honestly, they are not the most important things in life and yeah, I don't know. I feel like those spaces are again, hard for me to navigate, From a place of multiple marginality 's. I am not only disabled, but I'm gay and a woman. So it is hard to navigate that and again, feeling more vulnerable. Just in those spaces, makes it hard to Always like react from a place of calm in a place of feeling. Not so you know not from a place of scarcity. Yeah.but, you know, I yeah, I don't know."

I try to be as friendly as possible and as open as possible. But typically I hang back and observe and just kind of watched to see, you know how people treat one another Another within the group and where I fit and so the reason is because I fundamentally do not trust new people, obviously. There are a lot of reasons for that. I think it's just because a lot of the times when I am in sort of, like working situations, whatever, like it's majority like street. It's the majority like the majority of the group is going to be straight and I feel oftentimes at odds because I am visibly queer. And yeah I just kind of wait to see how I'll be treated again the dynamic of the group. I just but again, you know, I feel like I'm fairly social person. I do like to connect with people, obviously, I want to have a good working relationship with people. I try to connect with people, I think like, you know try to find out what their hobbies are and see if we connect in any way or you know, see if you have commonalities but also like make sure that I'm not sort of showing too much of my personal self to people right away before I know it's safe. I would say that is why my first work experience is really negative and I think moving forward, I just want to be very careful about who I engage with at work and how I'm engaging them and what I'm telling them about myself,"

And really like what is annoying? Like is it a personal like annoyance or like, is there something more than that's happening that, you know, like is it a cultural difference? I don't know, for me when someone is annoying me, I kind of think that, you know, you have to share it. You're an adult and you have to share space with people. Oh, and so my feeling is that, you know, as long as they're not causing harm, it's really, you know, I really try to like be above it or like, just not acknowledge it or like not. I don't know, I wouldn't say like to avoid it completely, but I guess it just kind of depends like, are they like chewing loudly or are they doing a behavior that is really grating on me because it is affecting my work performance, you know, I would say that my, I tend to ignore it like unless it's something really bad and I feel like it has to be dealt with, then, I will directly, you know, bring it up like It, when you do that, that's really difficult for me for reason X, use I statements, whatever try not to make it personal, but I would say, you know, unless it's incredibly egregious, like I just ignore it like because not everything, you know, res revolves around me and this other person's having their own experience. So I guess the answer is it just kind of pens."

I mean I like my workspace to be tidy but you know it's like when I'm working there can be no books route or whatever. I mean it's not always you know, like a sterile environment but I don't know. I mean I feel like Keeping everything. Super neat all the time. I don't know. It requires a certain amount of work and energy and But at the end of the day, you know I like things to go in their place. I like things to be tidy while I'm working, though, like it doesn't have to be super tidy all the time, but it's not like also like I just have trash everywhere. Just kind of like I'm spread out maybe and I have papers, or whatever, on my desk. But again, at the end of the day, I like to put everything in its place, lock it down. Make it nice so that it's right for the next day."

They're not going to be organized in a perfectly symmetrical List. It weaknesses first. And then strikes, one of my big weakness is, is I am a procrastinator in my life and I have what people call imposter syndrome. So, I am I start things and never really finished them in a personal setting. There are times in my life in the last 35 years of me living. Where I have been successful and I've actually finished projects to completion but those are things that I really really care about the things I truly desire like helping other people fundraising for other people in wheelchairs like myself. To go to Adaptive summer camps, both teenagers and adults and also funding ALS research. That's something that I've seen through to completion. But since graduating college you about 10 years ago, I really had impostor syndrome in terms of publishing my book Which is mostly written and just the negative social media reaction that it might Garner for people because I have different views and I know that everyone has an opinion these days and I shouldn't be afraid of publishing my book, but I've seen negative feedback and many authors for a variety of reasons, so that's something I'm trying to work through. So that's a weakness of mine. I am an impostor syndrome person. I am disorganized, you know, visually on my Desk at times, I have to clean up, you know, once a week twice a week, the Clutter on my desk. So I'm disorganized suffer from imposter Syndrome have anxiety and depression though. In my weaknesses, my strengths are. When I when I do, do something with them passionate about I take the lead on things. Usually, I am very how do I say this? And I want to say authoritative, but I'm firm. I'm firm. And in how I handle other people. I'm good at directing. Them, you know, stress is a problem. I when working under deadlines, I've had problems before, but at the same time, I do manage General stress day-to-day on a very good level. So due to being in a wheelchair with my cerebral palsy, I think I'm good at adapting. That's his strength. I am good at adapting on things that I have to get done and I can't procrastinate. So that would be some of my greatest strengths and weaknesses. Hopefully, that's good enough for you guys."

One for me to answer your friends would describe me as funny sarcastic, generous giving stubborn, sometimes when things don't go my way, I don't like to start arguments, but when I start, I tend to get the last word in. I was recently diagnosed with social communication Disorder so that's one of the symptoms of that. I'm trying to work through, I am what I guess people call an empath and a problem solver and that his work to my advantage at some point, my disadvantage and others. So friends would say, you know, James is very helpful, he is giving generous, kind good-natured good intention very chilled when talking about two people. Not really combative, unless I have to be channeling, a nice guy and I do have a flirty sign which I try to regulate. When I'm around certain people, most people would describe me as entertaining.

It was the end of one job than a second job. I worked at a Consulting office after graduating college, for about a year for about a year, right after graduating. And again I didn't want to reject their offer was just a part-time thing. It was a temporary job and then the third. All right hand. Was a third job. I took was in an ice cream store from 2015 to 2017 and the our landlord didn't want us there. So, just to give you that background information. Before I answer the question I made, you know, from 2019. And now, I've made professional decisions that I'm happy with, including not really wanting a job and going to broadcasting school and attending broadcasting school and graduated from broadcasting school. Now, I'm not happy that Took an exorbitant amount of money like 10 or 12 Grand that my family didn't have that. We somehow managed to finance through time to go there. But yeah, I mean I've made some professional mistakes even to the broadcasting school. I remember there was one night when the class of 20 people. We had a video project due and I hadn't finished it because of my cerebral. Palsy is of due to my physical abilities. With my hands, as I'm in trouble manual and when I told the instructors that but some of the students were like, Like James winning going to finish this. So, you know, I tend to be, I try not to be confrontational but I've made decisions that have I've regretted, you know, professionally. Like when that kid ask me a question like class I lashed out and nobody showing that, but I still graduated. So, yeah, I depends on the situation and trying to get better at it because of my recent diagnosis of social communication disorder. and now I just want to do a podcast and monetize that somehow, you know,"

And we were trying to describe shapes that we couldn't see any each other's screens. And that was a new team of people and when I usually join a new team for anything, whether it's a prolific task or something else, I like to jump right in and either lead depending on the vibes. I read in the room on either jump in and lead or I will just let other people do the work for me and in terms of following them. So sometimes I feel like I'm a leader other times not, you know, one team where I have to lead our my nurses because they work three of them actually for because one of them lives at made with three of the four, you don't have to make sure their timesheets are correct and click them and lock them out and virtual portal every week. So, you know, when I enter a new team, it depends on circumstances. Generally, I am just a person to either. Leads or follows, depending on reading the room at first and seeing what everyone else wants to do. I don't I only delegate things in the nursing situation when I need to and in other situations like that permit. Observe a when others have clearly taken charge, I am more than happy to be submissive and step back and just follow their lead."

His name is read and he's annoying me lately because he doesn't have much money and I understand he wants the kids Christmas gifts for his foot model girlfriends and Instagram. And I follow them as well. Just to be fully transparent and he denies guys. 36C has developmental disability and a bunch of other health issues and lives in rural Ohio, with his mom and his sister and her mind telling you this. And you know, I know this is going to stay confidential. And so You know, I wanted to help read because a couple of months ago he was bullying by another person on Instagram, another person on Facebook and they were teasing him that. Sorry about the phone in the background, they were teasing are worried that he would never get a girlfriend. And so I felt really horrible when these people teased him and I took it upon myself to help re now fast forward to three months later. I've used what little money I do. Make from taking online surveys to help re get video days with his girlfriend in a So I'm angry that, you know, when we started the thing in October, I said to read, okay? We're going to have one video chat and then that turned into two and then that turned into 3 and I was the one that paid for it and I should have said a firm boundary. So typically I tend to not let things anger me too much and I did the same thing here with Reed. Reed was like, all you can get Get rid of me as a friend of mine? No, no, no. I don't get rid of you as a friend, over the good intentions of helping. This girl who you've chatted with, before, get a Christmas gift that is not something to lose a friendship over. However, I am annoyed with you that we didn't have clear boundaries about that and you didn't come to me. First, he told the girl first, he was going to buy something for her and then the girl picks up the expensive and then I was forced to pay for it. So, you know, the in that situation, that's how I normally react in any situation where people Who annoy me? I try not to let them get to me. The exception is like my family, my dad, my sister, the people that know me best. When they do things, that annoy me, then I tend to get angry and yell and curse and whatever. Yeah. But otherwise I'm generally a calm person."

What when I tend to get angry? I feel 100 times to a close family members and I behave that way because they know me best. But if it's somebody like read or even someone that I don't know, I don't get angry. It's just not worth it. Okay. Now when my workspace was not very organized at home or in an office oh goodness. Really have to clean it because if I don't clean it, I don't clean my workspace, then I feel disorganized and I've had periods of weeks go by and where my desk right here and my desk over there off, the ultra, the side of the camera has been very disorganized and either I or a nurse will have to clean it because it gets too cluttered and I lose focus. And I find when I clean my workspace, when I do take the time to do that, I am much more focused much more relaxed, much less likely to get angry at anyone and will say In relation to these two questions, I do get annoyed and upset when the schedule that I have laid out for myself, changes drastically, suddenly like if I suddenly have been go somewhere with no warning, then I do get upset and annoyed but when I'm at work or in a workspace it's usually centered time. Typically I schedule an out and blocking outs and I get things done and I make sure that my My workplace is organized so I can focus. And I even put away my phone to do surveys like this because if my phone is around that, I'm going to be easily distracted. That's what I typically generally do. I try to get rid of distractions and avoid distractions, I can get things done that, I need to get done."

So that's one thing I'm always working on is presenting things to other people and they still kind of clear cut, but little bit nicer of a way I guess."

I would definitely go above and beyond for my best friend. People, I consider to be friends. And this can also be seen in a company that I work for willing to pick up extra shifts and cover for people. If they need off, that kind of thing, stay late. If I'm able"

I'm typically willing to make this, make a step up, take a step further to maybe increase my status or income. There have been a lot of opportunities or situations where I'm previous jobs. I've been asked if I was interested in a promotion or taking on more responsibility for more money and as long as it's doable for me and it's something I really see myself doing, I'm typically more than willing to pursue that opportunity and accept the promotion or more responsibility."

I kind of just try to get a feel for the people. I'll be working with and getting to know them a little bit better before I really put myself out there so that I can kind of find some common ground and see how they interact with each other. This is definitely true with the most recent job that I started. joining a team of teachers that have worked together now, for a couple of years, and being new to this field or and also this team, I was very excited to start with them, but I kind of took my time warming up to them. get just getting to know them so that I would be able to have a better relationship with them after I knew them a little bit better."

If I can excuse myself in the situation just to make sure that I'm not going to act on professional or anything. I'll remove myself for a little bit. And maybe see if there's somebody else that would be able to communicate to them better, if that's necessary. Otherwise I really just think about grand scheme of things when I'm in the moment and Realize that it's one situation and that will get through it. And I kind of try to put myself in the other person's shoes, and think about what they might be going through and how why they might be upset or possibly, come off as annoying for me, just to kind of try to keep myself grounded when I'm in a situation like that. I think this is because I work with a lot of different types of people and I do try to understand the situations that people around because everybody's going through something and I think this is just a good way to kind of, get through life without Having so many negative interactions."

So normally when I join a new team of people, sometimes I feel like am I inadequate and my skilled enough? Do I know what I'm talking about? Are they going to be judging me? And I feel like that is due to me and not always having confidence in myself. I'm sometimes I am comparing myself to other people but in the meantime I heard this quote that said don't compare your behind the scenes to everyone else's highlight reel. And I feel like whenever I enter enter into a new situation, you know if it's people that I don't know if it's a new team, they have to work together. Sometimes I also feel that maybe there, they might not be able to work as good as I work. I'm just again thinking back to school. I just remember. There were you know, instances for group projects that your grade just dependent on everyone else and I, you know, I felt like if I would have just done this myself, I would have gotten a 95 and 780.

I am very driven, highly motivated, and can be extremely Dependable in my field. I would say as far as a weakness I play I pay very close attention to detail. Typically you know, everything I do is very organized, very detailed. Old but to that level of detail can also take some time. So, due to being so organized, I feel like that is sometimes a weakness."

You know, I would pretty much take the coat off my back for anybody that I care about and I am completely selfless when it comes to that. So definitely caring loving also honest as well. I kind of tell it how it is. I don't sugarcoat anything it's you know how it is how it is and I think that's something that my best friend would definitely. A about me and something that they appreciate about me."

So one instance in particular, is I work with a lot of our customers, quoting new business, and new parts. So, one situation that comes to mind is You know, working on a quote and providing the customer pricing that they necessarily were not happy with. So I had to be very diligent in my work and very precise to get them to the price point that they needed to be. And it ended up being a huge deal which in turn benefited, me financially and acted my status overall, I think, the reason why this was was because of my motivation and how driven I was to, please the customer and to also ensure that the business continued to grow"

Operational excellence team, which is a small team that was built in order to drive results and to focus on quality excellence. And ensuring that the company performs at a level high level standard. So I tend to pretty much be myself when entering a new team. I really don't hold too much back. I don't really think I feel nervous, I'm fairly confident in my abilities and my knowledge when it comes to the industry. So I typically just Stop. I am myself. I don't think I act any differently in a setting with a new team as opposed to working with my current team or those that I have worked with for a longer period of time."

So one particular situation was, I was working with a sales guy and unfortunately, because of a language barrier, I really could not understand him. I couldn't. Stand exactly what he was looking for. And I sense that he was getting frustrated and annoyed on his end as well because we were not getting to the main point of the conversation because both of us were relatively lost ticket to some key points. So what we really did, you know, I just, I was patient, he was patient, we work together as best we could Put things into writing put things into details far as graphs to call out what was needed. So it's not something that I'm proud of that a situation like that annoyed me. I just you know, I want to do my job thoroughly and accurately and when I run into a situation where when something hinders that, and in this case, it was the language barrier. I I got annoyed and frustrated in that situation."

So this is not typical of me or my personality at all. The one thing that's coming to mind is when we were undergoing a audit, I was I had massive amounts and piles of paperwork, all piled up on my desk and in my Office. And there was a method to my madness. I had everything in the right spots. I knew where everything was. However, I mean, it was very, very disorganized at as at a visual perspective, someone would walk in there and look and be like, whoa, what's what's going on here? But it was me trying to get through the Auditors request and in order to do so that required lots of paperwork, lots of piles of paperwork. So that is one time where I don't feel, I was as organized as I could have been, or should have been, but I definitely have learned from that situation and will not let something like that happen again."

Because of that, I would say that my greatest strength as an employee is that I rarely make the same mistake twice. Ideally a situation at a company should be a learning opportunity for the employee just as much as it is a chance for the employee to contribute to the company. I would say that my greatest weakness is that I'm not naturally a people person, but that just makes me want to work harder at making everybody get along and making sure that everybody's on board with what we're doing. Because when everybody's sort of pulling together and more or less content with one another, that makes it a lot easier for me and I'm sure it makes it a lot easier for them."

I feel like they don't understand that a lot of work and thought goes into the supposed intelligence and articulation, but nonetheless, I'm grateful that they think so because that's what I try to be. I want to be able to communicate my ideas with other people and understand their ideas. Well I want to be sure that I've completely thought through a problem or an interesting issue and I don't want to be quite as much of a perfectionist as I am. So easygoing works for me and hopefully creates a better environment for the people around me."

That means not just thinking about the money. Not just thinking about a title, not just thinking about a piece of work. I can show off to people. I have to think about how long a project is going to take whether or not, I can work with the team and basically it, it's more. About work-life balance and how it's going to build towards a better future than it is about short-term gain. And I think that's just because I've had some bad experiences during my freelancing work that have taught me that the seemingly easy or lucrative task is not necessarily the one that's worth it. The one that's worth it is the one that actually create some momentum for your future. ER, and doesn't make your present into complete unlivable with frustration."

So when I enter a new team usually, what I do is sort of sit back and listen try to get a handle on the personalities around me see who's an expert in what and see how people like to get along with each other already after that I can start asking people questions talk. Going to them about any concerns. They have with me and just basically starting to build a professional relationship with people for me. It's not a natural process. Like I'm going to walk into a room and be friends with everybody, but I do try to be considerate of people and I just feel like it's important because I'm not the natural. Everybody's best friend type to make an effort to be considerate of people."

I mean, people have the freedom to do a lot of things in their life. They have the freedom to make little noises or have their own weird personal habits, or get fixated on subjects that I'm not necessarily comfortable with as long as it's not HR territory and I feel like I should let them be free to do that. At if it's something that I really can't work with, then I'll try to work away from them or I'll try to have a calm talk with them and let them see how it affects me and see what we can do to sort of give them the greatest amount of freedom without completely ruining my work setting. I, I just feel like Harmony is more important here than me personally. Getting Annoyed with something."

If you consider a somewhat disorganized workspace, a flaw. Then I have to say that is typical of me. However, when it comes to work materials, I always make an effort to have multiple backups to have both paper and digital versions where applicable. And those, I'm very keen on keeping organized keeping right where I can. Access them and being able to access them at a minutes. Notice, I don't play fast and loose with my work. when it comes to the important things, I feel that I am organized when it comes to extraneous Amazon boxes and extra pens and such I have to say, I'm not"

And then there is Is. I mean it's a fag you know there is a customer that can't be pleased at all. You know. No they're just coming in and they're pissed off and whatever the reason you can you can help them. But when you do encounter them, you try to try to show them all, you know, whatever you could offer. But You know, they're going to make doing the crocodile, they're gonna make fun of you and stuff like that.

I tend to think it's a good thing because I'm busy or a lot of customers that need to be attended to. So I can't take care of my areas, you know, I got a, I got a birthday party. So I clients, you know, and I try to clean up as much as I can and you know, is I'll help the customer but as I said, my first part is to attempt to cuss client so it's always a good thing."

Let's say someone took a sick day or they just couldn't show up to work for a few days. They know nothing they can rely on me and count on me to, you know, to help them out with whatever the Mist, help them catch up, help them, with whatever. I mean, you know, just to not fall behind. I mean, they know they can count on me and similar some other people to, I know, I know I can count on them to so, you know, just being very friendly, very Trusting and carrying with about others. And that, pretty much just, you know, being being or having empathy for others and just getting along with the people. And so I'd say, in terms of strength, that's my one of my strengths in the workplace, just being it being an overall helpful person with others. And I don't really expect anything in return. Is just something that I've always had something that I've always the way that I've always been, I guess weakness, I would say I'm a little reluctant to admit when I need help, so, sometimes it can be Be read to me. Taking longer on a task or an assignment that I would normally would normally would take someone. Let's say a 30-year minutes to an hour to do. It might take me a 90 minutes just because I didn't want to I want to actually do it on my own. Not have someone help me out. I kind of feel like help asking for help deciding weakness and I know it's not but I mean it's just a really bad habit that I needed to. Break from doing that. And I know it's something that I'm working on. So I hope to hopefully not rely on my myself as much as I used light of, as I'd like to and just get assistance and ask for help when I need it. And something, it's something that I'm working on."

I don't someone who doesn't expect something in return. If they help someone else a good listener, someone who can, you know, get some feedback, some advice if you want to just shoot shoot around and just, you know, just toss my ideas back and forth. I mean, they know they can rely on me. I'm a, I'm a patient listener. They know, I don't, I don't take forever to like if you text me, I don't take forever to respond to the my to respond. Back in a timely fashion even I mean pretty quickly I would say that on his other than that I'd say that they party describe me as just someone who likes to help out whenever possible. I mean it's I don't they don't, I don't see helping out his burden, it's just something that's ingrained in me and I was brought up at to help others. I mean, when someone is in need I mean as long as it isn't put me in danger in Jeopardy or anything like that, but I mean if I'm in a position to help someone out and I can't, I will gently just Just how I've always been and it's something that a lot of people have described me as being very helpful and even in the workplace I can always I'm always being thanked about like just for helping someone out with whatever they like they were falling behind or whatever. The case may be same with my friends in my best friend though. They were totally know that that's like a really integral part of me and it's just from the moment that we met it's I think they kind of learned that. That's the kind of person that I was and what, what to expect. And it's just, I mean, friendly approachable, that I know that it was grimy is being friendly and I don't want to talk with him but, you know, open to communication and I would say, patient, understanding just all the, I mean, I don't want to send my perfect friend that. I mean, I like to think that I am, the personification of someone who is, you know, an ideal friend. I know, I know I lack certain attributes I guess in order to that for that to be true. But for the most part I'd say he would just say a friend would describe me as being helpful, kind and trusting."

Well, and which can potentially affect, how, how they move up on in the in the in their career or how much they make? I mean in terms of like actually getting down to work and not slacking off too much, it's something that I really am really have a good good. Look at the guy guess and I don't like if I see other people, you know, kind of goofing off and just being this track for distracting, you know, joking around and not really getting down to business. It's, I mean, I'll of course, like anybody. I'll probably just engage a little bit, but it's if I see them doing that for a bit, it's just, I got to get back to my own working. I got to focus on myself. I don't have time to the joke around. It's like off and hence, it's in a situation like that. I would, I mean, I might look bad in terms of My co-workers, you know that looking like I'm kind of uptight but at the end of the day I thought I had to look after myself and at the at the project a favorable impression of myself. In both my outward appearance in my the work that I put out is this, I mean, for me, is for me for the most part, it's just it's something that I need to keep an eye out when when I in my room when I'm working and that's Thing that I want to, I want to get. I want my results to show. Speak for themselves. I suppose I should say. And that's my my method of actually trying to just get my get noticed, I suppose, and hopefully move up on and get a better position and make a little bit more money. I mean, you know, I mean, it's also with the people, you know, a lot of times, but I like to let my work speak for itself and me."

If I was going to school in the classes I know the first impressions are everything. I mean that's what I believe that's when I meet someone new. I always you know, my first impression of someone is what the way out going forward is what I'm going to always kind of have a baseline for them terms of what I think about them. I mean, not the case for every percent of the time, but for a good majority of the people it is and that's just the reality of life. So Knowing that I try to keep try to keep a good in mind, how I'm projecting myself in terms of like being friendly, being the way, I act, the way I work, the way I present myself. I it's always in the back of my mind especially that first few hours. Few, first few weekdays, I think it's mostly just because based on what I said, how the first impression someone that gets of you, it's going to be the impression. It's going to stick on them. It's going to be it's gonna be going to think back to that first. They when they first met you I know that's why we in terms of me that's how I operate in the mind works. So I'm assuming that most people are either have the same mindset to. So what I try to do is when I you know I try to just be friendly, try to introduce myself. Try to Try not to seem too energetic. I try not to seem like I'm putting on a fake persona or something. So I just I try to be myself but at the same time I keep a keep in the back of my mind, I keep thought of just trying to, you know, I'm using these are the people that I'm meeting for the first time and I really want to set a good impression of myself. So it's sort of a balance between being myself and you, you kind of have to give a give a if your you kind of have to fake it, fake it till you make it of that. That's the best way I can put it, but you don't want to To put yourself out there. You don't your kind of you don't know how these people are. You know, you also learn about them too. So you're trying to hit a balance of like being yourself but also projecting a good positive, upbeat image of yourself."

But I remember when I first started, you know, like to say in the workplace, I I've always had a few co-workers in whatever job I have had. Where someone is in pulling the way and they're just they're doing the bare minimum and that we used to, just irritate me so much. It's like they would get on my nerves. It did kind of like, you know, I'd get like Angry in my inside my head. Just that like just the fact that would be nice. so lazy and they were pretty much earning the same as me, but doing the bare minimum, I mean, everybody else could see you could notice it. But I used to be act like, you know, just being really, really annoyed. Irritated angry. It's like that's how I used to do. I used to take it, but as time went on different jobs, and I noticed there was always that certain person who you could always tell who's doing the bare minimum. They even if they could like, you know, do a little bit better job and be a little bit more productive and help the team out. I could still just tell that they don't care. They just, they were just collecting a paycheck, you know, you could tell it was on their face from the way they worked with it. Unit, but it used to really annoy me. But I mean over time I'm like, you know, whatever people like that, they're gonna, they're gonna happen in life and you just gotta either deal with it or just let them do their own thing or whatever. I mean, at the end of the day, I can either choose to be irritated by this or just, you know, not really care one way or the other. And I decided that's how I wanted to deal with that sort of thing from that point on. And it's just, it's not worth the frustration, the anger. I mean, in the moment when Are you do you can tell they're not taking up the slack and you got your, the whole group as a group whole group suffers because of that, I guess in the moment, it is annoying distressing. But when you go home and think about it, it's just like what you can do about it. Whatever. It's it is what it is and is this I really don't want to dwell on things that you can't change. So it's it just seems like a waste of energy so I guess I've just learned to accept that there's going to be people who annoying me at various level so that's just how it is."

I I'm I clean it as soon as possible, I just, I like to keep things organized. So, with that being said, I didn't used to be like this all the time I used to have a, the messiest desk. I would let things build up. Haula books papers, notes, whatever pencils everywhere. But also to have a, if I had a glass of water, I will just leave it. My desk, get a new cup of water. Put it there again and just till they collected and then I finally have to get rid of them and it was just like a one I don't you realize it was spoke about it's both it looked at put on a bad impression of myself when people would see that and I realized I don't want people to think I'm like a messy person and just they must probably think that's how I met at home too and and it's not just that but I mean it just the stuff piling on my desk in my area just look like garbage and it's like I really didn't want the projection Get that sort of image. So I started tidying up a bit and just getting rid of anything that they need to be on my desk. So like right now my guess is like very Barren like, very Spartan it. So I only have a good Bare Essentials but even then it's only a few like a one pen pencil. I know pet that's it. New my keyboard also on my desk but I try to keep it very, very clean and I just don't want people to think. I'm a messy. Have a pigsty, I'm a dashboard. That's pretty much it."

I know projects can become really difficult and that different aspects of doing any job will have their stumbling point. And I'm really good at being committed and working through those, through my dedication. I also think one of my other biggest strengths is that I am non-emotional in my reactivity to events and so when things happen, I'd like to take a beat. Let the emotion simmer down and respond. Very logically, evaluating all sides of the situation and evaluating everything that is happening without kind of letting emotionality get in the way in terms of weaknesses I would say my biggest weakness is often in Being trusting in delicated and delegating tasks to others. I'm often very good at giving people tasks, but then I verify and verify and verify and I recognize that that's something I need to work on and be better about that. Perhaps people can be trusted to just get the test done and don't need to be verified with a thousand times but that's my biggest weakness is I delegate but I'm not great at trusting that it's going to follow through on their end because I want it to be done, right? And I want to make sure that were being as efficient as possible and so I do tend to oversee perhaps more than I ought to in that kind of micromanage e type of way and so I typically have issues with that but it is something that I'm actively working on."

I tend to be somebody who cares deeply about everything in my life, whether it be the people I have relationships with our friends or coworkers, or loved ones, or whether it be the things that I'm working on, or things that I'm involved with, typically I kind of fully commit myself to those things and I'm very passionate about that and I'm very compassionate. And to my friends to my family members and so those are really big components to my daily life is that I'm very involved in that. So for example, a friend of mine recently had a really bad car accident and after several weeks was still in a lot of chronic pain. And so, instead of kind of allowing her to continue to experience that, I invited her, come stay in my home where I could help care for her, and really be compassionate towards her problems. And I had several people tell me, He that that seemed excessively she has a home but I just care very deeply but people who I have in my life and I want to be able to care for them as best I can and whatever I can do and go out on my way to do that. I will. And so my best friend would certainly describe me as somebody who's very passionate and compassionate."

And I recognized that if I made one set of decisions, there was opportunities for me to potentially make connections and get other job offers or move up in the Chain by working with group a, but Group B was more aligned with the values of my current company even though they didn't have as many opportunities available in terms of upward Mobility or connections. And so in that conversation with them with both groups, I had to really think about what was going to be best for the overall good and not for any one individual. So, typically in situations where those types of decisions need to be made, I try to keep the greater good in mind and I try to keep in mind, what's going to be good for most people and not, what's just going to be good for me or just good for one other person. I think I make those types of decisions. Because I want to be very considerate of all of the factors in the situation and recognize that there are always on intended consequences and so something that might better me may have unintended consequences for others and so I should go with the choice that has the most good. And if there are unintended consequences of that choice, at least it's doing the most good compared to the other choice. And so typically, when I make these types of decisions, I really try to I approached them holistically and take my own self-interest out of it as much as possible of doing it any situation."
5e32fc389d3f972ca2dca81c_q4_c1_1672097412_1633daf2-8f7a-4b22-b837-445ed2573f8c,"My I join a new team of people or a new group. The first thing I like to do is to ask people about themselves and to really get a read on who the individuals that comprise the group up our and also get a sense of how they view the group. And its really interesting to talk to people about that perspective because they tend to get very different answers from one another even in groups that otherwise seem pretty cohesive. So my First step, when I'm entering a new group, is to really try to get one-on-one Connections in conversation with who are these people individually. And how do they view the group? I also like to sit back and just generally observe the group dynamic, and try to understand what's going on from kind of an outsider's vantage point. I think I do this because I understand it have been in situations where I've seen that not everybody is necessarily representative represented or thought of in quite the same way. Way and people have very different senses of what's going on in a group. And so having that experience firsthand, I want to be very cognizant that I'm not entering a group where that's happening. Or if that is what's happening that I'm able to be as unbiased as possible, particularly if entering, and kind of, a leadership position where it is important to be mindful of group dynamics, and how you may or may not influence those."

That is annoying. Me, is it that person's behaviors? Is it their attitudes that they're demonstrating is anything about them? Or is it something internal to me? Is it that I've just had a bad day, I haven't had something to eat. I've had, you know, bad things happening in my life and taking out step back too. Think about okay, why am I reacting this way? And generally, I'm very thoughtful about that. Why and that mechanism that's causing problems rather than jumping to attributions that it's somebody else's fault. I think a behave this way because I want to make sure that my reactions to someone or based on them and not based on me. And I also think that the best way to find solutions to problems is by recognizing the mechanism or the core issue behind it. Oftentimes when someone's annoying you, it's not really something they're aware of, or if it is, it's for a reason that's not the reason that's evident on the surface. And so by taking a step back and being mindful of, oh, I haven't had anything to eat today or oh, this person just got back. Our two week vacation and being really mindful of that, I find can be very helpful in getting to the root cause of where the annoyance is coming from and how we can address it generally. I find that doing that and having an approach of identifying, the source of the annoyance is the best solution in those situations."
5e32fc389d3f972ca2dca81c_q6_c1_1672097669_1633daf2-8f7a-4b22-b837-445ed2573f8c,"So generally my work is very organized as our my workspace is it is very rare for me to be in a situation where my work spaces aren't very well organized. I'm a very highly organized methodical person for me having things. Organized typically, calms me and it makes me feel more focused and able to concentrate when things are awry, either physically or organizationally in a project, I have a hard time. I'm concentrating on. What is the key thing that needs to get done and really kind of following through. So for me, having a physically organized workspace, helps me, feel generally, like I am more competent and more efficient. It also helps me mentally feel more organized and when work itself is unorganized, it is generally hard to understand what's the next step and The Logical flow of things. What's most important? What's least important. And so it's not typical of me to have and organize workspace. And for me I think that is because I like to think very methodically about things and I like for there to be kind of steps to go through and whether aren't steps, identifying steps and processes that we can go through this organization in my opinion, often leads to mistakes and mistakes, don't help any project or work happen, more efficiently or effectively."

I'm naturally boarding later, you know, I find myself, excelling, those positions and I know a lot of people, you know, say they found those positions every really wants to be the leader. But throughout my career, I've ran three businesses and I have total and head coach several sports teams, and stuff like that. I just find that when I, when I am allowed to focus on creativity and thinking, thinking outside the box and stuff like that, I said, I would do very well in those situations, like, sell those situations. My weaknesses I guess is not that not that I don't think I have any weight. This is so I definitely do. I think there may be times when week this is could, maybe I am just too creative you know and I'm and I know there's times that maybe I'm afraid of failure as well. So this is where Dynamic, I guess, totally have like, you know, I'll get super creative and come up with something, but then I'm upset that like it didn't work out when I think like those are both positives and weaknesses and at the same time, you know, one way it's good. That, you know, you think outside the box sneak up with new Solutions, But in another way a lot of times those things fail. So the good news is you can hop back on your bike and try something else."

I mean not really like crazy in a bad way like almost a mad scientist type of way. I really love to very non-traditional. I really, really like to explore things from lots of different angles and you know, kind of bring traditions of Traditional thinking and so I think very I think my friends would definitely describe it is very creative. maybe a bit argumentative, not I don't know. I that's probably the one that's probably the wrong word but like, you know, I definitely will, we'll play Devil's Advocate and part of that is me approaching things from different angles, looking at all sides and trying to find a logical reasoning or a logical cognitive chain of events in your thinking that I drive you to the conclusions."
5e531b2205acdb33c0f5f24c_q3_c1_1671663492_ba68fd41-f606-403f-a31d-0fe1b62780ba,"So when I think of situations that you know, in the professional field, maybe that could affect your standards. How much money you make? I will tell you that. I was self-employed Iran. Several businesses, but I ran one from the better part of 20 years. And the focus was solely on making money, you know, which I think is the idea of business in general. But I also do believe that, you know, taking enjoyment, and providing a service and being ethically, having some kind of ethic moral compass. I think that can't be completely swept under the rug so quick background. I just for 20 years, I made pretty decent money and I decided to take a regular nine-to-five job and social services and work with drug and alcohol clients way less money. But you know I wanted some kind of reward baby or some kind of rewarding or want to feel like I was making a difference or something like that. So I mean when you talk about status and money, none of that is really down super important to me because if they're miserable your miserable, you know, and I know companies want to make lots of money. Obviously I mean, What their business or so. But I think there's a way to do that. There's a balance of doing that and You know, employees. You know, or owners even like to do this in an ethical, ethical way and do it in a way where, you know, there's some solar some hard behind it."
5e531b2205acdb33c0f5f24c_q4_c1_1671663615_ba68fd41-f606-403f-a31d-0fe1b62780ba,"So when I joined a team of new people, I think a humor is always one of my things that I always go to you, right? And maybe downplaying the importance of what we're doing, you know, just to kind of relieve the stress because I think when people are stressed, they don't make, you can't make great decisions. You can't think of things. Logically, when you're under a large amount of stress. I mean, I'm not saying you make will make bad decisions, but I think that pressure sometimes we leaves you to kind of just not seeing other options, not finding creative ways to accomplish goals. So I think when, when I come to a new group of people, I kind of, I'm kind of like, you know, let's have fun doing this, right? Let's let's let's let's let's think outside the box. Lets, you know. And if we fail, we fail like, you know, I mean like I know that's not the greatest thing to say. And I know that's what is not what a lot of companies like to hear but I think, We're people in the end were people, right? And the idea of people coming together in a group is, you know, to all work together for a common goal and but we're people were social, you know, we like to have a good time and I think with you have that easygoing attitude, it kind of Fosters creativity. You know, when there's not a ton of pressure to just deliver a result"

I think that's the thing. You know, people are going to be annoying. People aren't going to be what I want them to be do things that I want them to do and I fully accept that, you know I also fully accept people's Falls, right? Um, a lot of things that people do come from different emotions and different. Your life experiences. And so I think it's just being accepting. I think that's it. I mean, I'm not a perfect person, I'm sure nobody is. So I think that, you know, you kind of you kind of just don't over react to their annoying. This is trying to understand where maybe, you know, depending on what kind of annoyingness it is, you know, you kind of just go with the flow or Like understand, they're just people and, you know, they may not know better and I'm sure they probably don't see what they're doing as big in the way, right? Like they just don't understand that. I don't even really, you know, I'm not gonna make conflict out of it. I'm gonna try not to, at least, you know. I'm here with my about day, so maybe I will. You my guys got some point in everything, is that people are people, and if you can't work with a broad group of, People, you're probably in trouble in society. Maybe that's one of the problems that we have, you know, we just got to be accepting of people and what were their intentions are their intentions bad. I mean, they're not going to be what I want them to be people just are going to mold and, you know, be pliable to what you think they should be. So I don't know, just You want to work with everybody, it's not that big of a deal."

So, a lot of things are running through my head and a lot of times that kind of goes with being a little bit disorganized and chaotic, I guess. But, you know, I can understand my chaos. I think I think that's the important thing. I'm on, the classic list to make her, you know. Try to keep my my thoughts and life. My my priorities, you know and check problem is I'll lose the list most of the time, but I think that's, you know, we have this negative opinion on people that aren't organized, I guess. And I think maybe that's wrong. I think maybe the, you know, the disorganization, you know kind of relates to the mind even and like Being disorganized A bit chaotic is really just having a lot of different things flowing through your mind at one time. And I don't think that's a negative rate. Depends where what Fielder, you know what you're looking for, I guess or situation, but I think some of the greatest ideas have probably came out of chaos and out of that disorganization. So it's rather frequent with frequent frequently. But I mean, that's why all the way my mind works. And I think the way your mind works sometimes is going to, you know, translate to, maybe you're enjoying your desk space or the way you accomplish things, you know? But I don't think it's a bad thing, you know. So yeah. It's trying to take a disorganized person to make them organized, and I think it's throats our growth in a way."

I'm a very, very hard worker, you know, I I've been through probably the toughest educational experience that a person can go through. I graduated medical school, you know, I'm currently in residency and I think that just says all arms on them about my work ethic, you know, you don't get to where I am without working very, very hard. I think my biggest weakness. Would probably be. I guess my biggest weakness would be that maybe sometimes I'm too in my own head and maybe kind of isolate myself in terms of getting jobs done. I tend to like to work alone which could be a, may be considered a weakness so that doesn't mean I'm not good at cooperating with others or I guess collaborating but ultimately, I think that might be something that could be considered a weakness."

I'm pretty busy in my job and with my family and we don't live in the same city so it's difficult to sometimes, get a hold of him, you know it's hard for him sometimes get a hold of me because I just, you know, there's too much going on in my life. But he would also describe the probably as a great listener, somebody who really cares about him and his life. And I think he would describe me as someone who is loyal and Typically is. Someone who cares about his well-being. so, Yeah, I think that's how they would probably describe me."
5e55c629171aa20a11be18ea_q3_c1_1671737993_c1af4945-d913-440d-ae5f-325910f03834,"So you know, I mean I guess the biggest decision that I made that would affect my professional status and how much money I would make is when I chose what kind of residency to pursue doctor salaries vary widely depending on what specialty you pick. So I ended up picking radiology and you know I think the way I behaved in that situation was I kind of looked at my test scores and I guess I behaved in the end. A logical manner. I look at my test scores and my qualification and said, will I be competitive? Well, I match into this specialty and I also looked at what specialty appealed to me the most and it was Radiology. So it was kind of a no-brainer at a certain point. I think the reason I do that is because, you know, you got to look at the pros and the cons but you also have to be realistic. If you're just because you want something doesn't mean you're going to get it and in the case of radiology, it's very competitive special. T. So without the proper scores test scores you wouldn't be able to do it. So just deciding to go for it without having right. Test scores would be a stupid decision. So you know you got to be realistic about these sorts of things and that's how I approach them."

And then I was with them only for a year and then I, when I came to my Radiology, residency was a whole new group of people and every year, there's ten new people added to the group. So, in 10 people leave, I think I behave pretty, pretty, normally, I typically pretty friendly, I'll ask people about their lives and try to get to know them. I'm not the biggest person. I don't typically like to have the attention on me so I try to not necessarily Focus too much on myself and kind of my personal life but you know I will engage in conversation like a normal person. I think that is just I'm just a private person. You know. I want to I want to, I want people like me and I want to be friendly but I don't necessarily want them to know everything about me and my life right away."

I'm a kind of relaxed dog person. So, if I'm being annoyed, will usually just don't know, not necessarily ignore it, but I'll kind of take it in stride and kind of go with the flow. Now, if it continues, you know, really, really long and becomes really, really annoying that, I will eventually say something. But yeah, I think it's just that just kind of the way that I am outside of my home. With other people, I tend to just kind of go with the flow and be accommodating. So you know I would only really say something if it got really out of hand in and started to be really really annoying. So yeah."

I'm pretty usually an organized person, but if it were to not be organized, I think it would be during times of transition. So like starting a new new job or changing rotations. The clinical rotations, would typically put me maybe a little bit disorganized at first, but For the most part. I think that my work space is pretty organized, so I think it's not very typical for my work to not be organized, which is I guess. What the question is asking, I think the reason is that I just I work better with clean organize workspace. I think it's distracting to have a bunch of clutter and not a were things that are so I try to keep it in order."

Well, one of my greatest strengths is that I'm a good team player. And I do well working with others. When I work with others, I usually Become a leader type and help like to obtain most of the objectives on working. Also, while we're going to groups I'm also good at categorizing helping others Helping others, you know, use the best of their strengths. One of my weaknesses is working alone most likely when I work by myself, it's hard to motivate myself. So there are times where I usually do all usually procrastinate, but I mean that must be the ADHD and me. So generally happens to me a lot as a single, as a single.

You'd also describe me as being highly competitive one. That likes to see success, more than Failure. He also sees me a person that loves to give the charity and also not have problem, you know, not cause problems with others. So generally I'm a person that is a good-natured and Goodwill. He would also say that there are moments were I can be very sarcastic.

But I was really good at attention to detail and it was a good at organizing stocks and putting items in locations that would help people see what are they were? They want. So I decided this one day that instead of just doing my job, do I normally do I would actually organize things and make things appear. to my specifications and lo and behold a manager. Got hold of how, you know, how good my attention to detail was especially with a lot of the things that this person had wanted me to do and more and behold.

And usually if you want to get to that same goal, you know you you use what, you know, the strength you have and then you find and then you work with others and then you get to that goal. so, the way I usually usually act, as I act in a way where It's a bit, it's a bit.

For example, usually when I tell them, no it's no. But because little kids don't know the meaning of no, they usually will continually annoy you over and over and over with the same repetitive message. I'm told they get What they want. So I think a reason why I get annoyed this with my children, at least it's because when I tell him something, that's what I expect it to be, and I don't expect to change my answer. But, you know, my kids be my kids, they're stubborn. They keep trying until they try to get what they want and sometimes I give away sometimes I don't.

My best friend would describe me as a positive individual, who is always there for them, and who always has their best interest at heart as somebody who they can come to, when they need to talk about things, but as well, in addition can just hang out with them. I think they would also describe me as a patient person. Like mentioned earlier, stop it. You're gonna make me lose my money. It's 12:00."

And in these situations are usually, like to think about all possible scenarios in the pros and cons of each situation. I think that is because I like to see the best in people and because I try to avoid confrontation in situations. That could cost me my job or could affect my future. I would not like to say anymore."

And so I have to stay really organized. But when a student gets upset, they can make that organization. In an organized, very quickly.

And if we have a line that we cannot cross because it would put someone safety in Jeopardy, I will not cross it. And so, therefore, sometimes I come into conflict, because people always want to make the best decision for the business that even if it goes over, something that would potentially put us in risk for safety. And I absolutely will not do it. I will work overtime to make sure that we're not trying to come here and that puts everybody in a safe distance. One of my best qualities is that I am. Also participate attention to detail. I work with project management or the details of what budget, I work with schedules. And so usually I can work with any team member who's having a problem in order to find a resolution to a problem because I will go through and read every bit of fine, detail to find everything every A alternative way that we could do something and I will step up and ask questions to see if there is an alternative solution, so my strength can, sometimes be my weakness, but I find that my employees tend to like it better that I am a detail-oriented person because I catch things that most people don't typically catch."

So she says that I'm perky and I'm quirky and I read a lot because I really do whatever your life. And so he says I always have The best thing to talk about because I read so much it. So there's always something that caught my interest or a question that I'm asking myself and so I like, hey, I didn't realize that was even a question for myself. Let me ask other people and see how they feel about it. So she says that I'm very outgoing. I'm using a natural born leader and she just loved has me around because I make her laugh all the time.

They were in the process of downsizing and I was responsible for a new project that was 36 million dollars and there were 250 people who were a part of the team who are working on this project. It's very important that we have this assignment done by a certain date and we found out that a piece of Hardware that we need to get with brand new and what's going to be? The better gets for us would not even be available. Six months before the whole project was supposed to be do. So I was asked to go in and tell the executive that everything was okay, and I absolutely refuse to do it and I knew that when I did that a promotion was on the line for me, but I said, you know what, I'd rather take a financial hit been be responsible for 250 people losing their jobs because we couldn't produce this product, and there was a light in the country today. If it was not completed on time, Not only would we be under our kind of financial Real stuff problems that will come up but we also would take a financial hit for like every day that the project was not on time and so that one was a tricky one and I was working with a community who was very upset with me because I took the Saints and said, no, you can go in KB - that's what happened. But I won't do that, I won't put my name and my reputation and my team on blind like that."

I'm a project manager and I work over different teams across the country and so sometimes I get pulled in because it's my particular area is my particular product or because someone else needs me to step in and substitute for them, typically I come in. And if I'm the lead, I make sure everyone knows right up front. This is the way that I operate, I will work with you to the extent that you allowed me to work with you. If you need me to micromanage on micromanage, if you don't need me to micromanage, I want Michael made. I'm a really laid-back person on the easy Open Door person. If you need to come and speak to me, come and speak to me if there's a problem come to me through, you know, there's a problem. I will help me figure it out. And so that tends to be where we accepted by most people. The only people who don't like that are the people who don't think they need to be micromanage and the way that I operate with them. If our allowed them to do an assignment I'll give him a gold hated what we need to do. We need it done by this time and if they don't do it or they show me, they won't communicate with me. Then I'll forget me and more until they showed me that. They don't need me anymore and then I'll get back. So usually it's received pretty well. I don't have a lot of problems with teams that I joined because I got hit, I do it all the time."

Why are you stressing yourself out with these type of jobs? When you get gifts, be sitting at home, like having babies, that annoys me or when someone says, I'm a sweetheart or a deer or a baby, I can't. I'm very short. I'm only 5 feet and so I interact with a lot of people via video conferencing over the phone so they don't necessarily understand just how short I am when they meet me and Parker. They're like, oh my God, you're like a little bitty thing. Oh, you're so sweet or like when someone says darling all because they don't do me like that in my industry. It's important to have respect and to have people. You know, acknowledge your position when you're in a position where you have to make decisions and tell people what to do. So when they do things like that, I know they think they're trying to be cute but really it's a little bit annoying. So I know I feel that way because I want to be, I want to be just one of the team, one of the boys but sometimes, you know, they're just like, oh, you're so girlier.

I like to have things meet me put away now I also work with So many projects that people are coming in and leaving documents and leaving packages and I get stuff through the mail and stuff is everywhere.

I do a lot of art and craft, don't know, be careful behind me. Okay. All types of little boxes and bags, with different types of arts and crafts, a job. I know where everything is. I hate when someone comes in and changes my stuff because I'm like, no No, no, you might not know where things are. I know exactly where I placed him and then like, right now is Christmas, so things are a little bit disorganized because I like, Christmas decorations and I pulled out in the boxes.

So, as usual, are workplaces where they're organized and I think it just comes from incompetence from the top down. I think it's important to have an open and honest communication when those doors are shut. Creates issues. In those issues, just keep warming up, warming up and the doors opened. It just creates more disorganization than is needed."

One of the first things I like to do is come up with pros and cons for each decision. Then I'll take a step back and a lot of times, I can logically sort my way through it based on the pros and cons list, but sometimes you kind of just get a gut feeling, you know, which decision is the right one. Of course I do consult my friends and family about what they think is good to, but in general, I feel like I have a pretty good gut feeling of what would be best for me. And the reason that I think the way I do I'd say those stems from my very logical background, that tend to be fairly grounded and I like to see both sides of the picture."

The weather is different. The people were different, I have absolutely no family or friends and this area. So, coming into this new group, I was both a little shy, and also eager to get started fitting in with this crowd. One of the reasons that I was so eager to get into fitting in with the crowd is because I knew that these were the people that I was going to be working with for the next two years. So I might as well quickly. The new situation because it's not going to change for a while. And I think this approach to it again, falls back to the more logical side of my brain telling me that the situation is not going to improve anytime soon unless you force it too. So"

Some of my friends have described me almost like an elephant in that way. It can take a little bit to make them angry, but when they do get angry, it is a very binary process where they go from in a fairly decent mood to just in a terrible mood. One of the big reasons, I think that I react the way I do is because I grew up being the oldest of three siblings. So it was kind of my job to put up with a lot of stress from the younger siblings. I think it's some point, everybody reaches a Breaking Point and that more or less is what causes me to completely do a 180 and flip over an edge? Is because I tend to not react at all. Until I do get extremely angry."

I'm currently pushing through that situation. Myself historically, I'd say not being organized, pretty typical of me. I tended to procrastinate quite a bit while I was an undergrad and I learned about halfway through that. That was not really the most efficient way to do things. Towards the end of my junior year and then in my senior year, I started taking things much more seriously. I started writing dates down and calendars, really focusing on getting organized and doing things ahead of time. I brought that moves me to grad school and it may be a much more productive person going into a work space after having to be able on parole and was not very organized. It kind of brought me back to how I was an undergrad, but I think the advantage of being on both sides of the issue being both the unorganized person than transitioning organized. I think that really helps me adapt to situations like this. I know exactly what I need to do to get organized."

I, I tend to throw myself into the fire and just, you know, deal with it until the fires burnt out but like the better colloquialism there. I've been in so many situations in somebody jobs, whether or not it's retail or gardening or volunteering manufacturing, anything like that. So, I've come across a variety of different situations or work kerfuffles and in all of them, I've acquiesced, and all of them have adapted to get the job done. And I feel like that's probably my greatest strength is, regardless of what's going on, however, many bells, and whistles, and alarms are going off. I'm pretty good at sticking in the moment and clearing things out and getting things done, and moving on, to the next thing. as far as my greatest weakness goes, Is an employee. I would style. I would say being a people pleaser honestly, which is good and bad, right? Because I want the customer happy. I want the consumer happy. I'm on my boss too happy. I want my fellow co-workers happy that's not possible to do all the time when I'm in percent and balance everything correctly, right? So sometimes in trying to, please someone else or help someone else I will neglect. another another issue or another person or another facet, so, In my opinion, those would be my strengths and weaknesses."

No matter what time of day it is, I lost some sleeping obviously you know as far as night goes no matter what I'm always there to pick up my phone and either talk serious, you know and I mean we got something on their mind or just make jokes and distract them or just have a good conversation. That's something I do. Kind of pride myself on is, I try to be available to all my friends. I think. I think in today's world, We get too wrapped up in ourselves. I think reaching out to others or being available to other uses, Equality. Equality, that often gets overlooked astronaut even better way to put that. Yeah, I would say my best friend. Would definitely describe me as a loving kind person and pathetic. I'd like to leave the world better than how I found it and I love listening to people.

How much money I make things like that? Again, this kind of goes with the first question, I'm a people pleaser. And is an example here during covid during the whole financial crash. In isolation, all that I got the crypto. I found a cryptocurrency community that I kind of fell into. I liked it. It was me mobile, it was fun. You know, there's a good time being in there. Eventually just being in there and being what type of person. I am being helpful in answering questions, directing people they gave me on my position and I took that position way too. Seriously. I was in there all the time, it cost me a lot. In hindsight it cost me a lot more, right? I gained a lot of skills while say that and I had some fun but it cost me a lot of relationships because I viewed it as work. I took it too seriously and I should have just viewed. It is like a hobby. Dang it. But the laugh.I want people to be happy. I want people to see the quality of my work and be impressed and I want to help people. And because of that there's times where, yeah, I definitely go way too hard or take on too much responsibility. And why do I think that is probably something to do with how I was raised or childhood? It's ingrained in me, I want people to be happy. I want to bleach them. You know, I take myself and my work too. Seriously. Sometimes. Yeah."

Case in point I joined another crypto Community not too long ago. They needed smelled moderating, keeping people active in the server. So I was hosting events spending a lot of time in there and helping out again. Got promoted to a mod and all that it wasn't worth it. Like at least with my other, my position I got paid for this my position I didn't and so that Joyce taste out, it was you know it wasn't worth it, but one eye. And Enter a new team. I again, take out a lot. I try to see what needs to be improved. I try to see where my skills are going to be better utilized, right? And then I just kind of get to work and I'm more of a shower than a teller in that sense like I'll just start doing stuff and then you figure out like, how I work. And if I have any questions in the interim or I feel like I'm pushing too far too much I'll but often ask but usually you know people are more happy to let a new person come in and, you know, Take the brunt of things not to put that and I don't mean that disrespectfully. English sometimes isn't the best way to communicate. Yeah, I again tend to take on too much. But I'm very open, very nice.

Of course, you know, Like let's say someone says something super embarrassing and it's weird for the conversation and people involved. I'm one that will basically try to move the conversation along redirected you know And that's born a group setting in a personalized setting. Usually, I do my best to either. Blow it off and walk away. Take some time and space. I have to again, it depends on the situation where I'm at now. Or we find Middle Ground. Hey, I didn't like that. Particularly enjoyed what you just said, the, why did you say that made you think that or that's wrong? It's just Wrong. We need to talk about that. We reached that information, like I said, it depends on the situation. And again, I why do I think that is? I want people to be happy. I want, I want teams to function, well, I want us to function.

But so in a factory setting, I try to be very organized as much as I can especially when you doing quality controlled or something like that, but there's times where it gets out of hand. You have a lot going on or running around the shop. You're being a floor manager, you're checking in Parts, you're doing Logistics and all that. And sometimes things can get a little shuffled around. Disorganized. There's still a system. You know, I still have a system. I know where I put something in. That would be the most irritating thing, when I put something somewhere and someone else comes to use it, and then doesn't put it back. Even though, you know, aren't they put it back in a different spot even though it makes sense? Like, I don't know, eight may I have my own system and my own desk have a way that it works but a package, but then also, like, when I'm in, what I'm doing, computer worker and At work or something like that, you know? My speech is usually very well organized by files. Start by filing starts very organized and then over time it just caddywhompus to nothing in metis and it'll take like a few hours to reorganize everything. And again, why that is I think I bit off, bite off more than I can chew in a sense, right? Not the best colloquialism there. I'm quick. I get tested. quickly, I move quickly through them and when you're helping, A bunch of different people or bunch of different fields, bunch of different parts, connecting sometimes things for me, Get Lost in Translation, goes there goes, there goes their boobs. Wait wait wait wait, wait put it all back together. So I think that's why honestly I think just because my natural quick disposition and wanting to help people and move things can get a little disorganized at times. Now, take a breath. With and we organize everything and then keep going, do it again."

I pride myself on being a very productive individual somebody that values a sense of urgency when it comes to work. And so I try to be as efficient as possible with the things that I'm doing in my job. Subsequently. This can also end up being a weakness sometimes. Because especially if I'm working in a group setting. If I find that other people that I am collaborating with, or managing, or seeing over, are not living up to that same kind of work, ethic or efficiency standard, I tend to get somewhat irritable with it and I can be very hard on other people for not raising their own level of productivity. So for me, A lot of times my weaknesses, Stem from the things that I consider to be my strengths. I would prefer to work in an environment that challenges me that presents obstacles for me because I do feel like I thrive well, under pressure but at the same time that definitely has its drawbacks because I am expecting a certain level out of myself. And if I don't reach that certain level or I don't feel like I'm reaching that certain level, sometimes I can get Get demotivated with whatever I'm actually working on because I end up feeling like I'm not living up to my full potential and that can actually be somewhat of a detriment to me. I also feel like a lot of times I'm really good in a collaborative setting because I feel like ideas are really meant to be explored through a lot of different perspectives. But once again at the same time that can also make me feel like I want to work. Work on a lot of things myself because I can feel like I'm doing all of the work and the only way that I'm going to get it done correctly is to do it myself."

My best friend would definitely describe me as somebody that is willing to put in the time and effort into relationships and to getting to know people and to be very selfless with the things that I do. But they also recognize that if somebody is not Not giving me what I need. I can be very selfless selfish and I can be somewhat resentful. So I like to believe that overall my best friend would say that I am a really wonderful person. But my best friend also realizes that I am a realist and I am a bit cynical and so they would also assume that or say that I'm definitely the type of person that lives by the Golden Rule but also So is more about an eye for an eye. So I give when I get, I expect respect because I give respect and if I do not get that, then I can be probably one of the worst people that, you know. So it's a little bit of a give-and-take. I have quite the dichotomy to my personality. They would definitely say that. I'm somebody that's artistic. That is willing to put in the effort to Take ideas, morph ideas, turn things into other things. I love being a Creator and my best friend definitely knows that. I appreciate all of those different types of kind of mindsets that come along with a creative personality. And they would also say that I'm just generally a fun person to be around. I love Exciting situations. I love funny situations. I love making people laugh. I love having philosophical different discussions, so I think that they would also say that I'm a very well-rounded person, which is something that I actually tend to appreciate in myself as well."

I care about money in the sense that I need it to actually exist on this Earth. But in terms of my professional life, I don't need to make the most amount of money. I think that there are other things about my professional career, that I care more about Doing work that I feel is Meaningful doing something that gives me a purpose, doing something that challenges me. And so in situations in the past where I had to choose between, maybe a job, that fulfilled me more or a job that would pay me more. I would always pick the job. That fulfilled me more because I feel like generally in my life. Things that make me. Happy are more important than money. I've been poor before. I've been well off before, and so I've seen both ends of the spectrum. What money does to my own happiness and it doesn't really affect it in the same way that having a job that is either good or bad. Does, I would prefer to have situations where I feel fulfilled internally, then to get my fulfillment from external. Validation, like, money or material possessions. I really think this is just kind of due to the fact that I have been poor before and I have had situations where I have made a good amount of money and I didn't really feel any different between the two of those things. So a lot of times I'm really thinking more about my own psychological happiness, about the things that really matter to me in the broad scheme of things. I tend to look at the future. In the very distant future. I don't necessarily Focus right on the immediate present and I think somebody that focuses more on the immediate present would think more about the money aspect and what they can actually gain from a professional decision. May, I'm more concerned about how can I actually grow as a person? How can I actually become a better person? A more well-rounded person and somebody that can actually look at themselves in the mirror and say that I'm doing something purpose. Awful with my life rather than only looking in the mirror and saying, look at how much money I made today."

One of my biggest strength is that I can be a talker and it's very easy for me to connect with a wide range of people because I've had a lot of different life experiences that have required that I interact with a lot of different people. So, joining a new team is something that is exciting to me. It's something that I feel like I can actually bring a lot to the table in terms. Terms of making the team very cohesive, because I'm able to relate to everyone in the team. I feel like I bring a sense of uniqueness to collaborative type events and situations, because I'm very open with the things that I think about the way that I think about things, the way that I present ideas, the way that I present information, and I am not afraid of making mistakes. I'm not afraid of being wrong. Don't get embarrassed, I don't really get nervous. And so I'm not necessarily concerned about all of those other types of things that other people may be concerned about when they join a new team. A lot of people are concerned about, you know, am I going to fit in? Are people going to like me? I don't really concern myself with any of that because I know that I can kind of fit and mold myself to that team in any way necessary. So I look at it like a situation where this is just giving me another opportunity to increase my skill set grow as a person. And maybe create some really good social relationships, not only professionally, but maybe personally, as well. So I look at it like a really fun challenge. That is something that I actually prefer to have in a professional type of environment."

However, if I'm in a bad mood, I really have no No problem saying what I feel. I'm a very opinionated person and so if I'm already in a bad mood and somebody's annoying me, I will call them out on it immediately because my ultimate goal is to remove that annoyance from my life. Really. The only thing that changes is the flow of events and actions or reactions that get to that. So good mood, I'm more likely to just ignore it. Let it roll off my back, but if I'm in a bad mood, I'm More likely to address it immediately in hopes, that not only does the person that's annoying me understand why they're annoying me but maybe that can also help them correct that behavior in the future. If it is more of a personality type issue where it's not just a specific action that they're doing to make me annoyed but more about their overall character or personality that is annoying. So I try to be the forgive and Get type of person but more often than not. I'm going to just call somebody out on it immediately because I like I mentioned in previous questions. You have to give respect to get respect and I don't feel like I'm getting respect if somebody is annoying me and I'm not making them aware of why they are or how they are."

I'm actually a very organized person. I actually pride myself on being super organized. I'm not OCD or anything like that, but I do believe that everything has its own place. There are times in my work in general, where I see other people's work, stations and work areas being Not very organized or messy, and a lot of times I will either proactively go and try to clean it up for them. Or I will bring it to their attention that they're actually making their job, and they're making their job harder and they're making the workspace or work area itself. Unsafe a lot of times, people don't realize how much this organization and messiness can actually affect the safety aspects of things. And so I would Much rather organize everything and make my job easier than to have to worry about all of the things that come along with this organization. A lot of people end up being frantic or panic because they can't find anything or it makes their workflow less efficient. I'm all about efficiency, so I'm trying to be organized at all times. So it is very atypical for my workplace or workspace to not be organized. If it is not organized it lasts. Or maybe 30 seconds or you know, a minute or two minutes, maybe an hour because of maybe I'm doing something else but as soon as I recognize that something is out of place, I do whatever I can to correct it because I feel like it's more of a personal choice to have an organized workspace that allows me to do my job. The way that I expect to be able to do my job, which is highly efficient and highly productive and I cannot do that with Messy workspace. So I will always take care of it. Regardless, if it cuts into other time, this is I consider it to be a good thing, but some people may consider it to be a fault because if I am more concerned about organization, rather than attending to a specific problem, at any given time, that can kind of, maybe put me behind, but ideally, I'm already organized so that I don't have to do anything to worry about the disorder. Organisation."

I find that. I'm usually able to work well with people and I have just a strong ability to lead a group and really bring a lot of ideas together into one like-minded idea. Wow, this is also a strength, it does sort of hinder me from being able to Work by myself and work on something so low. And I usually prefer like the collaboration aspect when it comes to completing certain tasks or projects. And I find this to be something that I might struggle with or something. That is a little difficult in a workplace setting. So I prefer to work with the team and work with the group and it gets just get things done together. As I find that, it's just more of an enjoyable process, and it makes things simpler and Easier."

I say that they would use terms such as energetic in vibrant and colorful to describe me and they would probably also describe me as loyal as And so on. That's very hardworking and reliable when it comes to relationships with others and just friendships in general.

And what I believe me and my individual situation in my scenario as other people might from the outside looking in, make assumptions about what decisions I'm making and they might sort of criticize what's going on. I know that it would be difficult for them to grasp like the scenario that I'm in. So I'd rather work to rely on On myself. When it comes to making make these challenging decisions as I find that that is the best outcome for me in that usually is the sort of principle that I guide myself with when making these sort of decisions. It's just to focus on self and rely on what I know instead of trying to base the decision, I make off of others around me and their opinions. Although I would say I'm open to criticism and open to People in putting their ideas about my situations. I would say that I try and leave the final decision up to myself in a lot of situations."

Like, you have multiple personalities in this multiple ways of thinking, which isn't a bad thing, like it's great to have Like a lot of variety in the type of people you're working with. But I find that the best thing to do is just feel out who you're with, and I think that I do that tend to do this, just because I want to be able to not only have these people as a team, but also consider them friends and consider them people that I could personally connect to him personally, personally relate to. So in order to avoid many may be any conflict. X beginning, I sort of assess who I'm working with and then tend to go off from there when it comes to working with them on maybe a project or a task."

And I'd say that how I reacted me situations, usually varies based on who the person is. What, exactly they're doing where we are and really like my relationship with them. Like if I would say, if they are close friend, I would try and let them know exactly how I'm feeling. Feeling well, whereas, if it's someone that I know is trying to purposely bother me and purposely annoy me, I would try not to give them the satisfaction of showing that there that this is working even though it might be. So I try to tend to remain calm and remain the really unbothered by whatever that they are really trying to push on to me. And I feel like that's really important to just keep your cool and stay. Level-headed. As that's really the only way to win with these sort of scenarios."

So I think that this is pretty common as someone who likes to work with others and it's not necessarily something that can really be avoided. Like, you'll have those times when people are just not Young as you would like them to. And that's okay because it's really not things aren't really supposed to always just work how you want to and it's important to sort of see the approach of others that you're in the group with and I did by myself. When I find that my work is unorganized I usually and I would say I apply this to working with others as well. I usually find myself taking a step back and really looking around me and seeing what's really causing what's Going on and trying to assess what I can do to. Sort of just keep things, like quiet, things down, and keep things moving and simplified things really, for me, and those around me."

I like to understand, I have to question. I passionate I tend to be hardworking and love what I do and I take the time to make sure I do all of my responsibilities but one of my greatest weaknesses I tend to be nervous especially when I'm starting out. I sometimes things may feel overwhelming but I can get over this after some time of training. So once I get used to things, I then tend to be more Curious and able to work and better."

I usually try to have a clear head. I tend to like try to understand everything about the situation. Sort of like what could be the consequences are calculate? How much I work? I have to put in what would I have to do calculate the steps necessary? I think that is because I generally a man over planner at tend to want to break things into like baby steps to understand how I can get there and sometimes the nervousness or anxiety of the situation may get to me when I make professional decisions. It's usually an overwhelming bearing load, and it could make me very nervous. And that's I think that's why I may act like that sometimes."

Very type, A personality and I tend to want things kind of done to a tee the way that I want them or that, I think they need to get done.

In order to stay home with my kids and I knew that I was still going to need to bring in income, I knew that I was still going to need to find a way to help provide for my family, but at the same time, I knew that I couldn't keep working the immense amount of hours that I was and being away from my kids as much as I was. So I think that, you know, for me it was Was something that was really important to think of myself as a professional but also think of myself in a very personal way. So I made the decision to really prioritize what was going on in my life and to decide to put my family in front of my profession. So, I started my own business which has become very profitable. I still probably don't make You know, more than 10 years after that decision was made. I don't make what I made back then, but I'm happier and I feel like my priorities are right."

I think that for me entering that new team was both scary and exhilarating all at the same time, it was something that Definitely gave me anxiety to be trying something new, but it was something that brought me a lot of joy in the end. I think that I am a people person, so the fact that I not only could still be working with people but also I think making a difference for people by being a supervisor that really made a difference. For me, I felt like being part of the management team. Gave me a feeling of power. Not in a, I'm a powerful kind of person, but a feeling of power, like I could make a difference and that was really important. And to me as well."

We you know, we were selling our products and I was really enjoying this new phase in my life but I also wanted to give the chance for other small businesses in the area to kind of give them an outlet. So I opened up to kind of a consignment and And I think that, for me, the situation that annoyed me, the most was one of the consignees really feeling like she wanted to take control of things. So I would let her come and set up for special days and she would move other things around in our store to give herself more space or she would just kind of, you know, go in front of other people's items because she felt the need to be in that. That area. I think that for me, that was annoying because it didn't just affect her it affected, a lot of other people, a lot of other people's products and to me it wasn't being a team player. I definitely put a stop to it in the nicest way possible, but you know, I definitely felt like she wasn't being a team player at that point."

Funny to come and move even the smallest thing. My stapler my Kleenex box anything like that just to see if I would notice. So it's hard for me to think of a time when I wasn't very organized. And I would probably say when I first had my child had my first son and I was still working. It definitely was the first time that I didn't care as much. So there were times for things, got a little bit more messy, a little bit more, you know, not very OCD and I think you know, it was because my mind was sometimes elsewhere. So I think you know, not being completely focused on my workspace that being Completely focused on where everything was and things like that. And I think it was a product of being a mom and lack of sleep and also just, you know, changing priorities,"

Think about why that thing annoying me about why what reasons that person may have had for doing the thing that annoyed me. and, Above all else. I just try to take it all into perspective. And I think it's helpful for, you know, the end where you essentially you want to get together with that person who want to work out the problem instead of letting it Fester into something more than our glass."

It's something that I worked overcome and I think I've made some progress with overtime. Um, but there's always room for improvement and I think essentially that's just a part of my personality. Something I need to work on. As I said before, I think I have made some progress but there's always room for improvement. If I were to work for you then any notes, you know.

I tend to be very empathetic and honest and really take a lot of pride in the work that I do. Usually that is kind of what I'm known for. I tend to be very honest, I really listen to people and tend to be very empathetic when I'm interacting with other people. My biggest weakness I was here, as an employee is that. I am Am I tend to be a little bit quiet? I don't really vocalize my concerns as much as I should and sometimes that can lead to people thinking that I'm on the quieter side. I don't have much to contribute in reality though. I believe the reason I do this is because I tend to process things before I say them out loud. Just so I want just because I want to kind of seem like I know what I'm talking about seem like I'm in - and kind of educate about what I'm essentially talking about. And so that is primarily my biggest weakness, another weakness I would say is that sometimes I can, you know, take a little bit of time to get started with things tend to be a little bit slower. When it comes to first, starting out with tasks and learning things. Once I do understand things and learn the process, I tend to be a lot more efficient but it's just kind of That initial learning process that I do tend to be a little bit slower and require a little bit more hand-holding when it comes to starting up with things."

I'd say the biggest thing that my friend would describe me as its supportive. I tend to be very supportive with any, you know, friend or colleague that I have, I will always try and support them. Always listen to my friends, whenever they have any sort of grievances concerns any problems that they're dealing with, I tend to be really good at listening and kind of Ting feedback and kind of a sounding board that they can kind of, you know, talk to and really feel like they're being listened to. I think I would also be described as, you know, being empathetic and honest. You know, I tend to tell things as it is, I tend to be very empathetic with people. Just kind of how, you know, how they're feeling. I try and relate as best I can. I'd say another way my best friend is friend me is just You know, Goofy and light-hearted, I tend to, you know, be very laid-back. I don't think take things too seriously. I tend to be very easygoing and so I think these are all kind of adjectives. That would really describe me. Well,"
5e90a1eaad04060882d17a3d_q3_c1_1673489129_e594e899-7abb-437c-90f3-6b887e92ceb8,"So in situations where I have to make a professional decision that might affect my status or my income, I tend to be a lot more professional and take the situation a lot more seriously just because they reflect on kind of my identity as well as you know. It's very important to my career that you know my status and how much money I make, you know, this all affects my future, my career aspirations and so in these situations Patient's, I do tend to be more professional, not as light harden a lackadaisical. As I usually am tend to be more professional. Take things a lot more seriously and work a lot harder in these situations. As I want to make a good impression since you know, these cases are very important to me. Progressing up the ladder in my career which is very important to me. And so I really don't take situation like the very lightly and try to Really prepare myself for any sort of situations like these and really act to the best professional ability that I can."

Usually at the beginning since I do tend to be more introverted and reserved I think it does take a little bit of time for me to warm up especially at work where I tend to be a little bit more closed off as I just, you know, want to get my work done, don't really want the distractions. And so I pretend to be a little bit more closed off and a little bit. More introverted and quieter. And that's just kind of my general personality. That's kind of how I've always been. However, I do feel like I am very empathetic laid back, very easy to work with. So this does tend to work in my favor. I feel like once, you know, I get past that initial hump of, you know, that quietness intravenous and really get to know people better start to open up more be more laid back relaxed joke with people. And so I tend to and to, you know, do better when I enter, you know, a new team. And, you know, I've had a little bit of time to kind of Orient myself to the team and the situation."

And so usually when somebody does annoy me, I will usually keep it to myself. I'll usually internalized my annoyances my Grievances. And once again that's just how I am. I've always been a very patient person and usually internalized, a lot of things and so it takes a lot for me to get angry, so I typically will not get it. Angry. You know, sometimes if I am really annoyed I may try and accelerate the conversation or, you know, give short and responses just so person stops, you know, talking to me. And I feel like these are kind of better ways to kind of let the person know that, you know, I don't really want to engage with them without really, you know, being direct and kind of coming off as you know, harsh or mean. And I think a lot of this has to do with just You know, I really am cognizant about how people perceive me and I feel like that's very important and so I try to do it in a way that doesn't make me seem like a bad person."
5e90a1eaad04060882d17a3d_q6_c1_1673489357_e594e899-7abb-437c-90f3-6b887e92ceb8,"So situations where my work workspace. Not very organized. Unfortunately, this is very typical of me. I tend to be a pretty unorganized person. It's just how I've always grown up. Even you know, growing up when you know I was living with parents they would really have to do a lot of the cleaning for me and cleaning my room and make you my been all that. I never really did that myself. And so I think that kind of carried into all of this. And so I tend to To just not be super organized with my workspace to know have things kind of everywhere. I don't take the time to organize things, I just kind of leave them as they are and kind of feel like I'll figure it out. And so it's just been years of this kind of building up and now it's just I feel like I'm so far gone. It's just how I am now and so I haven't really ever like tried to change it or anything like that."

I follow Direction. Well, but I also offer My opinion and experience on how to improve things that I have to directly deal with myself. And Things that others have to deal with as well."
5e92ce0be2bcb3600ed93730_q2_c1_1671655912_0ab7be9f-8dbd-4a40-9f75-608ed4da0b27,"My best friend would describe me as crazy independent. Self-reliant. I'm pathetic, Maybe. Spontaneous. Shy and reserved at times. they may also tell you a story about, Some adversary, I've overcome a resilient I am."

She even with management if I believe that something should be a certain way, I make sure to voice my opinion. when I'm employed, I really find it important to Live life while I'm employed meaning not putting on a mask or pretending to be somebody.

Some people have different tones when addressing a larger group of people and I think I fit in by being somewhat reserved. But also I'm a listener. I like to listen and react. I don't like to be the one who's taking the initiative to lead to the group's brainstorming, if that makes sense."
5e92ce0be2bcb3600ed93730_q5_c1_1671656137_0ab7be9f-8dbd-4a40-9f75-608ed4da0b27,"So when somebody annoys me in the workplace environment, I tend to shut down and maybe if I feel violated in some way seek somebody who's higher up, if HR is in place, maybe contact HR. But if it's something menial and just mildly annoying, I tend to just shut down and allow them to go about Performing, how they are in the moment. I don't continue to be confrontational. And I think that's because some people including myself will sometimes are sometimes annoying. Everybody can be annoying to degree some more than others. I like to think myself as not that annoying. So yeah I would I would seek a higher up if warranted that type of action. Otherwise I just stay quiet and reserved and go about my day and tasks."

It's the ability to think of all scenarios, all at once, and then take all that and focus in on something as the solution, or the way, the better meet, the way to a better mean. means I can identify if I'm disorganized say like if my desk tends to have a lot of work on it, I will then I will then create time to take care of it and not let it progress further. And I think that's because sometimes we take on a workload that may be overwhelming or challenging. And that's what I think work is all about really is taking on tasks that need to be completed. And sometimes those tasks create a backlog and with time that back lab backlog is completed."

Um, I think it's just because it takes me a little bit to it'll warm up to people my days to be able to show, My whole personality. I usually like to get to know, you know, the people I'm around first before I unleash my full self. And that's just because I think I like to know who I'm dealing with and whether or not I'll get along with him or whether or not that will like them or the like me. Yeah."

I actually probably usually try not to react too much because I tried really hard to be conscious about other people's feelings and how I affect everything, because I don't like to upset people, or be mean to them or their feelings because I don't like to have that done to me. So, Usually, I try not to react. Really try to get away from the person or just remove myself from the situation. And it's just begin because that's the kind of person that I am I try to avoid conflict."

And that's okay, that's just how I operate. It's just the kind of person I am. I'm kind of ADHD if you get distracted, a little Beasley But yeah, it's really, really difficult for you to not be so organized or put together. And that's the kind of person I am.

I have my own personal goals that I have set aside each day and I'm very focused on those things. I also get a little bit OCD if I don't have those things really lined up or accomplished, I guess, I have like a strong adherence to controlling my such my surroundings and my situations. I am I think she would also say that I am a deep thinker and I like to really address issues like personality issues or things you know problems in my surroundings. I like to really think a think about those things in a deep way."

And I always think about how this could affect my future kind of, by putting myself in that future kind of, thinking of those possibilities just so that I acclimate myself to those to the outcome of my decision. I also, I think about the positive and the negative outcomes I'm usually, A little bit con, proper usually confident, but I can also be very cautious, very cautious. And sometimes a little anxious about those things that will make the wrong decision. And I think it's usually because I trust my decision-making and I trust my judgment about these things. I really trust my judgment and I know how to listen to my gut, but I also know that my God is not a hundred percent all the time. So I would say it's probably 70%, 70% optimistic and trusting in myself and 30% kind of unsure and anxious."

And this is usually just because I am an introvert, more on the mostly interview, introverted side. And I also realize that in order for me to be on a new team of people, it requires that. I be quiet and really observe, especially in consideration to people's personalities, how they speak, how they react to other people in the group. And really getting a feel for the dynamic and how efficiently things run, who tends to be the leader of the group. Just so that I have a good chance to know how to respond and think and act in a way that's going to be most conducive to the whole group dynamic and get a feel for how I'm going to fit in there just to because I want to contribute to that success. I want to I am a team player and I really want to be somebody who contributes to that success. So I want to do a good job when I enter that to you."

And then later on, I might try to avoid that person a little bit, maybe take some space and just carry out, whatever interactions are really required, and not spend any extra time with that person or interacting with that person. Anor. Maybe getting any more details than I would need to basically just do whatever minimal interaction. I would have to do. I would also just kind of mentally beware of my own self and how I can. Adjust my own actions and what I say and how I react to this person. Just so that I am controlling the level which they annoy me because I can only be responsible for myself because I internally, I know that that is, my main responsibility is to control my actions and how I respond."

I am I like and I value meekness and I think it's very in crucial to be organized when it comes to carrying out your success and achieving success. But also messiness is a result of work being done and I know that. And so Completeness can't always be achieved, especially in my own mind. I know that in order for me to be organized me I do have to take a little bit of my own mental energy and effort and sometimes, when I'm getting a big project done or I'm trying to really achieve a result quickly or on time, I will forgo organization or perfect neatness and order to get that accomplished because I know and I remind myself L've typically that I can achieve cleanliness meekness or just keeping things orderly, I can do that later when the project is completed in that it's not completely unattainable and I also trust myself that I will eventually get there when my project or my work is done."

I am a graduate from Coastal Carolina with my major being marketing and my minor being actually business administration. So I think a management position you know where I'm going to be training behind somebody who has a lot of experience would be very great for me because that's just going to be something that I can continue to build off of and that's going to bring me into my next greatest. And that I believe is my pretty much my assertiveness and my ability to cooperate and kind of brainstorm with everybody's ideas. I don't just like taking an idea that I have myself and working on it through. You know, the few businesses that I've started myself, I like to kind of crowdsource ideas. I like hearing what other people have to say, because it gives you a perspective that you don't have yourself. And I think, you know, to be a manager, you have to absolutely include everybody's is because, you know, you are not the only one who is working and working in this company and has, you know, seeing different parts of the company and what can be built and what can get better just as a weakness, I would say that I'm unfamiliar with a management position because I have not managed others before I've ran you know, businesses sole proprietorships by myself but I have not yet managed over anybody who's working On anything besides, you know, having relationships with my partners or and you know, suppliers of products and things, I have not managed anybody so that I would say is probably my greatest weakness."

Definitely extroverted funny and just kind of laid back person. I try not to take in too many stresses in my life, just from no worrying about things that I can't fix. I just try to keep more of a laid-back attitude because I think it allows things to work better. Obviously there's times where you have to get angry or upset about certain things that are very important. But I think just having that laid-back kind of attitude and able to you know deescalate situations and things like that is very important thing to have as a managers some more of the other traits that I mentioned, pretty much just extroverted. I'm very able to talk to a pretty much any type of person. We always tend to have something in, you know, in common which is very great common ground for me to be able to To relate to people that I work with are just people that I'm friends with it. Honestly allows me to have multiple very close friends, I'd say, but I think my best friend would definitely mention that as well."

I tend to, you know, never lose that aspect of myself of, you know, going out of my way to look a certain way or to act a certain way just to get a promotion or, you know, raising my status. But I think that everybody has that little push to, you know, maybe work harder work, add a little bit more detail in an assignment that your honor project that you're working on. I think that those things are pretty important to have, you know, in terms of status, you know I'm never going to act a certain way, just so I look a certain way to somebody. I want them to know me in the real me. So I think that's I kind of tend to just you know, act, you know, 95% like myself, you know, in situations that could have no affect my status of the money I made because I don't want to make a decision that later in life. I regret because it wasn't something that I personally wanted to do wasn't My decision. It wasn't, you know, it wasn't something that relates to, you know, my character and my ethics. Pretty much. That's the reason that I think it is but you know, there's other things that come into that to that was just the way I was raised, you know, my parents definitely raised me to, you know, be myself no matter what because you know, sometimes people were different have different perspectives that are great, you know, just looking at business professionals that have succeeded a lot in life, they aren't always, you know, down to the norm that everybody handles. So I think that it's a good quality. To have to, you know, to be yourself in those situations."

I tend to, you know, continue to act like myself, but I think I add a little up on the my whole extroverted straight. I think that I try to get to know people as fast as I can. Find their interest, find Common Ground between us form relationships. Pretty much just get, you know, a piece of Buddy's mind and kind of, you know, figure out certain things so that you can delegate certain situations to people that might be interested in it. Because if you're not interested in something I've seen this time and time again, if you're not fully invested in interested, in something you're not going to work as hard on, you're not going to work as well on it. So when you get a, you know, a project with this new team, we want to be able to put people in the positions where they're going to succeed. You know, why do I think that I act this way? I think it just tends to settle things down for some of the people that maybe aren't as extroverted aren't that social able to you know, get to know everybody. I think it provides. You know, when you can walk up to somebody start a conversation, ask them about their interest. It makes them feel more comfortable in speaking situations and adds that I don't know that that wholeness of your team to be able to interact with each other. And, you know, No exchange ideas and exchange you know certain qualities that can be used to benefit the team."

But once I find myself annoyed, I tried to not put myself in those situations anymore. So say that I had, you know, A supplier who was running late with things, you know, things on backorder that I have a customer ship for, that's going to be something that annoys me, and, you know, rather than send them, you know, a million emails saying how angry and, you know, How annoyed you are with them and how unprofessional it is just kind of deal with it. You know, send a couple of emails asking about the situation once that situation is over you and you know, we end our agreement you they're not going to be the supplier anymore that might just if you know it might happen once or twice which is totally fine and everything, there's always going to be some mistakes but if it's something that continues to happen that's when it's probably going to annoy me. So you know that's the reason that I like to do. That is just cause you want to give people a chance. But you don't want to continue to let them. Do the same thing to you because it's not going to end well for anybody in any situation."

Was actually my first job which was at West Marine location. Actually we had a very disorganized and kind of he was all over the place with his mind and what he wanted to do with the store and how he wanted to run it and what his, you know, his ethics and codes were, which were not up to par with what, you know, the company. Gave him as a manager. So, just seeing that not to, you know, work on someone's downfall, but it definitely benefited my mind. And seeing where certain things work, where certain things don't work pretty much in a in terms, you know, business, just what not to do there were plenty of things that he did do that word good. They were great things that he did, that helps the business, you know, continue to run but there was So many things that were just disorganized and no one really knew what was expected and I think that's a big problem as a manager. So pretty much when I got in it, when I get in situations where things are not very organized. It definitely helps me know what not to do in the future and pretty much when they're not organized. Just try to flow into try to flow into This workspace and the you know the headspace that everybody else is in, if things are very laid back in unorganized you know, you can still do things to help out and make things better you know try to organize it a little bit but don't go too out of place with what the manager wants because that's just the way that they like to run things. Typically if they're in a management position and they don't run things, the way that the company wants them to run things, they'll get removed It's so for the time being, I think you kind of just have to work with it just because you don't want to raise any heads and you don't want to get fired. Because in all honesty, the manager is the one who's in charge. You don't want to get in bad terms with anybody like that. If you want to stay at a business,"

I'd like to call myself a Swiss army knife. When it comes down to it, I can kind of do whatever you need me to just finding the right direction to move what you need done. You know, if I don't know what I can learn how to do it, I found myself really adaptable. I'm also very outgoing and friendly with people get along with my co-workers really well. I really enjoy getting to interact with people and especially having good interactions with them on a regular basis. So I try to be a good co-worker and employee and friend some people and I think those are definitely my biggest strengths and think that my Weaknesses. Definitely going down to I'm not a leader. I don't like leaving. I think people who want Power are You should be skeptical of people who want Power people, who desire it or not, people who should have it. Ever for any reason so I can leave, I don't enjoy it. I don't get invigorated from it, I don't find it to be fun. I find it to be a chore, a hassle, and a responsibility."

So I'll kind of give both perspectives on that, from this situation of making professionals issues, could affect the status column 28. And have never had a sales job, would want it. Think people who have other crazy don't understand how they do it. I feel gross when I do sales I feel like I'm using people and manipulating them. It's just wrong, not a big thing. So, from that perspective, that never happens, nothing. I do affects the status or how much money I make. I make the same regardless. Now, if it's about like things you do to continually do promotions or new jobs or whatever, then that's different, in which case, most of the time, I make the decisions to make more money. I mean happiness is important obviously, but when it comes right down to it, why money can't buy happiness? Money can buy the opportunity to do a lot of things that make you happy. P and without money, you cannot do those things. So realistically money does buy, you happiness, advise you the ability to get the experiences that you want that make you happy. So more of its better anything and everything that I can do to make more is what's always going to happen if I could quit my job paying forty five thousand dollars to make a job to pay me. 115 mile, I would do that and help you. Even if I didn't like the job Veronica 105 Grand a year, I can stomach a lot of shit."

I think that when I join a new team of people, I tend to want to get to know them, get them who they are in a great end with them friendly and outgoing person for liking people and like Being friendly with you will get getting to know people having that kind of invigorating conversations where you find out things that you're going to or have in common or things about people. You never expect their information. The ability to either come together with people or learn something new is equally represented in that investment. That's awesome. I think that's that's a ton of fun. I think that's a great great thing to do so you know I think just getting to know the people For who they are is important. It may not necessarily be the most directly work-related thing, but it makes everybody tighter more cohesive work better rely on each other better trust each other and those they're just never situation which those are bad things."

But that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you don't people, you still have to be right. And we're not friendly necessary. But at least at the bare minimum polite and civil. Actually just recently have a fellow employee with, with her happy. Very large personality conflict. He don't know that though, he's completely unaware of that. And that's how I react in those situations. Keep it to myself. I've been to my wife about it but I don't freak out on him. I don't yell at him, I don't Don't let him know in any way that I do not like him at all. And we have completely different views on the world and wife. He's a little bit older and probably pretty close to his retirement age, and he acts like he's a total Boomer and just he stuck in the past and has a particular way of doing things and it's Definitely not roll with it and it really gets on my nerves. But again, I interact with them. Just like every other person, I deal with every other co-worker, I have a joke with them as much as with other people. I definitely like to try to get him away from me as quickly as possible, but again he has no idea that we don't get along."

There's too much indeed. Have the it would take too much of your time and be a waste of resources to keep up with it in that way. So yeah, it's a little chaotic, but not terrible. It's who I am.

And I'm busy emergency department on a busy day, some days, it's just you up to anything. But, um, but you also, you could create an enemy right there because you're because you're, because you're momentarily annoyed, that's a really stupid reason to build an enemy at work. So, what you do is you can take a moment and you wait to the end of the shift and if it still bothers you at the end of the shift then you bring it up otherwise you start ago that's enough from you do and it's fine. Be that never happened."

Ohio is an attempt to find clean to do with my life because I wasn't happy with my major. And I'm place was a mess and she's a mess even, right? Third party. Usually, like, what are you doing? Couldn't there are you can get any sort of like, um, District support for the company. Nobody came in every day we were out in the Hinterlands, 40 miles, north of the city of Cincinnati. So nobody wanted to come see us and they didn't And so, we had kind of this messy messy messy clinic and um, that was not my typical of any of us. It was funny because everyone would come all got hired at the same time as one manager got promoted and then had to rehire the entire staff. And also, what the heck is going on? It took about and unfortunately, that called the clinic eventually closed. Like two, three, four years later made for your site and remember one of my girlfriend's that work there, she got promoted to manager eventually because he had a win for promoting District, we, but that should tell you but how hard work? How much hard work and good? But that face back together, we even had our new nurse practitioner Heroes, spinning around in front of her what we're doing because we had no idea. We were all new as a company. We were all new to healthcare really and I'm a manager with brand-new to. So here we are, here's a clinic and so, but four years later in the closing down because of changes in the way you can ecology laws are written. So I don't think it had anything to do with my girl. If you have to go at that point, is it only fix it? If it doesn't just organized organized,"

I like cooperating as part of a team, I appreciate getting to know new people and understanding their own strengths and weaknesses. I also tend to be very detail oriented but I do not lose sight of the big picture so that has helped me a lot as I've navigated the corporate world so far as far as weaknesses go. So I think that sometimes being detail-oriented can help a lot, but can also hinder on occasion and that is where one of my weaknesses definitely comes into play. While I do focus on the bigger picture, it is easy for me to look at things and think that small unimportant details need to be fixed and perfected to an extent. Another weakness would be in the beginning. I definitely take time to get to know People before I share my input or try to change different aspects of the group. So, on occasion people might think that I'm uninterested or unwilling to participate, but really, I just like to kind of get my footing and see different Dynamics before I move on. So, overall, I really think that my strengths and weaknesses balance each other out for a well-rounded. Added applicant."

Oriented. These are things that I have really valued in my life so far. And they have helped me to get ahead and be a really strong member of peace with the routine. An example of that, when I come into the office every day, I generally check my emails, make sure that everything is responded. To within reason, I'll give myself some amount of time to do that, and I do move on. If I can't get that all done within that timeframe just to make sure that other things are getting done as well. But other than that, the routine has helped me. Make sure I stay on top of everything, different co-workers, and people I've worked with outside of other companies, have always commented that I'm able to respond very quickly positively and provide information that they need. That helps them do their own job. Do with being warm that has really helped me form, really strong relationships with people that I work with, whether it be within the company, or outside the company, we both work as team players and that has helped just move things forward in a time. When sometimes it can be difficult to work with other people."

I worked as a salesperson for a large well-known Telephone Company a cellular phone company and what we were tasked with doing was getting customers to add different features as they called it onto their accounts. And what those were were things like unlimited, text messaging or unlimited calling when I worked there. These things were much less Less common. So it wasn't like it is now where they've got like pretty much everybody has that. So it really was a work to get people to add text messaging, for example, to the phones and the company at the time had updated their codes. From something that ended in a nine. So like nineteen ninety nine to twenty dollars and this would be something that wouldn't affect the customer that much, but was a big difference on our end. So, What our manager had recommended at the time was to flip the code so that we would get a new commission. So it would go from 1999 to 20 dollars and it would show up as a brand new add-on for the individual sales people. So, we would be able to make a ton of money off of commission from doing that, but I felt that it was highly unethical to do so, and lying and stealing from the company. I've always prided myself on doing things by the book and so that was something I wasn't comfortable. Portable with even though it would have really earned me quite a bit of money especially for someone as young as I was at the time."

What role each person plays on that team before I try to jump in and have my input be heard or valued. I just think it's important to respect the people that already work. They're not step on their toes, because while I may have something valuable to say it first, I think it won't be heard often the way I want it to unless I first respect those other people and appreciate their own valuable input. So that is definitely something that I do also. I think it's possible that it might come from a bit of fear of, not being liked but it has served me. Well, and that I've been able to assimilate into many teams easily throughout my career"

So I think this is an easy one to reflect on and consistently. I react as I would with anybody, I am annoyed internally, I do not show it on the outside. I think that that is important. I am being paid to do a job at the office. I am not paid to let people know when they've crossed me or do anything like that ever. Everybody is entitled to their own working environment. And if someone is doing something that annoys me then, so be it, I generally will try to get out of the situation if I can but that's not always possible. So I just go on about my day, buckle down, try to ignore it, stuff it down inside. Perhaps, if I need to and move forward with my job,"

It is very unlike me. It would have to be a situation where I was extraordinarily stressed out. I do pride myself on keeping a tidy workplace and staying organized. I believe that that is one of the most important ways to stay on top of your job. And I also think that your workspace is a reflection of your work. And if it is not Organized more than likely. Neither is your work. And that's a really important part of my job is keeping things organized. So, I know I can stay on top of them and get things done in a efficient manner."

And some were very goal-driven individual and I regard that as my greatest strength of the workplace as far as weaknesses. I do think I have an issue being direct, so that's why I would be interested in a training program for leaders to learn how to be more direct and effective way where everyone feels valued, understood and capable to do their job to the best of their abilities."

I have struggled with litter, I want to restate the company. I'm like, we're just might go somewhere else. So when I'm making these decisions, I'm usually thinking about what? It's going to work out, best for me. When the comparing is my status and how much money I would make, my concern is me, going to be happy where I met. I want to have a female, a good income, but I do also consider how successful the situation may be without you know, anything else. Go."

I've noticed about myself, when I've met job transitions in this way is that I, you know, until I feel established into whatever they want are in that group. But generally starting off, I like to put At myself in the best way, possible even exist and maybe dressing, you know, if it's a casual workplace and maybe coming in and professional attire for a little while. I think that's just because I want to make sure that I'm setting myself up in the best way and understanding the Dynamics of the new workplaces where I adapt to my new environment."

It can somebody times be frustrating when people send multiple emails about an issue that I am addressing, I do a lot of tech work. So, you know, once I start troubleshooting an issue, if I'm continuing to get email about the same issue or just Requesting updates. When we generally, don't really understand the problem or the solution, it can be very frustrating. Yeah, I understand that people don't understand how much goes on the back and it's especially with the type of temporary, but I do. So I can often look like, I'm not doing anything and I'm actually working for weeks to try and resolve the pollution problem through find a solution for a problem. And so when that happens, they usually just try to Let the person know an estimate of how long what I'm working on maybe and let them know that I will tell them when there's an update kind of cut back on that tension that is going on with multiple emails."

I am very intelligent and I can approach a problem from different angles and really attack it. Using maybe novel strategies that other people would have overlooked. One of my greatest weaknesses is that I I don't like to take no for an answer, especially when that know is because I said, so I want to solve problems that. I want to get answers, and I want to get results. And I have difficulty accepting that maybe something is not achievable."

The first is a conflict of interest. I'm a very conscientious trying to be very conscientious person. And so any conflicts of interest that I met May encounter, which would be very aware of those conflicts of interest and to put Myself above reproach. So to speak that I am not. I'm not doing anything that could be perceived as selfish or as self-serving, but rather, I want to always present myself as doing what is sort of the logical thing, the reasonable thing, regardless of what Regardless of what the situation is. So I'm very concerned that not only that I am reasonable with that I appear reasonable. I am very quick to speak up for my own. my own needs, if I And put in a situation where I couldn't survive, or I couldn't make ends meet based on on my financial situation, I'm going to be very upfront about that and I'm never going to just allow myself to be trampled. So I'd say that my status or how much money I make are important to me, because I'm not going to allow myself to be to be just drug under You know, when to fight for myself but I'm also going to make sure that I'm above reproach and that I'm always doing The Honorable thing and that I'm never letting myself be compromised."

And so, I could have a little emotional awareness and to kind of not just go full Full Throttle all at once, you know, I can, I can become very interested in a problem and I can start just popping off with a lot of ideas to how to fix the problem. And it can be a little overwhelming. So I'm just, you know, try to put the brakes on that. And and kind of ease people into the intensity of my my enthusiasm for problem solving. I also want to get to know the other members of my team. I want to know what people's strengths are. Oh no people's weaknesses are. I want to know what they enjoy, what they don't enjoy because if we're divvying up tasks, I'm usually pretty flexible. I'm happy as long as the work is getting done in. The problems are gonna be solved, but other people a lot of times they have certain things that they just hate doing or things I really love doing. And so I whether I'm the leader of the team or even if I'm just a supporting a supporting member of the team, and I'm not in a leadership position, I was want to know what everybody's good at, so that I can kind of chimed in and offer like, hey, maybe so and so could do this task because they're good at that. Maybe, you know, this task would be good for this person because they've done a similar task. And so I always want to know what everybody is good at because typically, I want to put People in their, in their most effective places. I want to get the system of the team running smoothly. And that's something that's very important to me. So, that's usually what I'm thinking about. When I am put with a new team is where do the pieces fit in this kind of organism of the hole?"

I tend to want to kind of like get to the root of the problem because people don't like it sometimes just being quote, unquote annoying. Like, I'm making the noise that I don't particularly like, or, you know, they have like a weird like work in their voice that it just rubs me the wrong way. I don't usually let those things bother me too much. I'm like, well, that's just. It is what it is and I can't really do much about that. It's kind of grin and bear it because I'm a very I try to be very tolerant person and Just because someone is doing something that isn't particularly pleasing. To me, it doesn't mean that there's nothing wrong with the way that they're acting Legend very lenient if some like licking a pad or something like it doesn't bother me. If someone is annoying me in the sense that they are a hindrance to a problem of trying to solve our task. I'm trying to complete then then that's an obstacle that needs to be needs to be overcome, right? And so when someone annoys me in that way, I'm always trying to be like, okay, why are you acting this way? This is the goal, you know, presumably we share a goal or maybe I have to explain. Here's the goal. But I I try to explain the goal as I, hey, from my perspective. Like this behavior is not contributing to this goal. I don't understand. The other person I was trying to be empathetic because I always want people to have empathy for me. So I'm trying to be empathetic and say, like, why are you why are you acting this way, you know, is there something we can we can fix and I try to try to understand the other person and we try to to fix the problem together and I would say that's how that's how I react in these situations."

Probably means that we're very busy and there's just a lot of stuff going on and I have not had time to take a second from my more urgent tasks and to organize my space. My work place as a whole talking about my co-workers that they sometimes may not be as organized as I would prefer. And, you know, I just kind of like that and do their thing. Fortunately, I don't find. That is very typical of my current workplace at all. Everyone that I regularly work with is fairly organized, at least our accounts, all of our work critical items are in in their places and they say, Stay in their places and we try to limit cross-contamination of things that shouldn't be in other categories. So I would say that being organized is very, is fairly typical of me at work. I won't speak to my personal life, but at work, I try to keep everything organized and shipshape and I would say, the being not organized is not very typical of of my work or work space environment."

I'll put in long hours. I don't mind going that extra mile helping out other people and stuff, as long as I'm compensated fairly and untreated. Well I have no problem going, the extra mile and do an extra work I think maybe some of my weaknesses is along. That same mind. I don't know when to stop and I can overworked myself sometimes all overworked myself. And generally all start not being as courteous to others or or not going as far above and beyond. As I once was, and it can be, it can be hard because once you set the bar high for yourself and then people notice that you drop down A lot lower. Its, it can be tough."

And generally, I'll do that for him and he'll do that for me and it's just a great relationship and I think something else that he would describe me as is also. As I mentioned in question 1 hard-working, we've had to do a lot of odd jobs and stuff for either of our families and we both had to work considerably hard during those occasionally. And he knows I'm a hard worker, and we've gone to school together and he's seen it all. So yeah."

Professional decisions, I'd say that I behave boldly because I know how much I'm worth and I know how hard I'm going to work and I think I should be paid accordingly and I think that is, I do that because in the past I've been taken advantage of advantage of I do put in the work, I do show up and I go the extra mile and then I'm not compensated accordingly. Something else that I do in those professional situations is that I ask a lot of questions because I want to know, I want it exactly laid out for me. I want to know exactly the responsibilities and going to have and what is going to be expected apiece. So, the surprises."

I as I mentioned in question, 3 Edge and really trying to ask a lot of questions and want to know what my responsibilities are going to be a I don't want to have any surprises or anything like that and I think that is typically because I have been burned in the past by not knowing exactly what I need to do and being blindsided by other responsibilities and something else that you want to enter a new team is just work hard. And so everybody will like you, if you work hard, nobody's going to complain or anything like that. So that's also another thing I do and something else is I don't really try to brag or anything like that. I try and just stay below the radar. Just do my work, do good work, work hard and yeah."

And it's listen apologize, Psalm think and I really think that's important because you want to listen to somebody this other problem and then you immediately apologized because even if the problem is, you don't really think it's your fault. Someone obviously thinks it is and you need to apologize for that. It's going to make them feel better. It's just whenever the situation and you don't really lose anything for apologizing, it's just the best thing to do and the next step you want to do is solve it. You can solve the situation, however you want. But that's just the next step you want to make right? The situation for that person. And at the end, the last step is you want to thank the person you want to acknowledge the problem and how it's been solved and you want to thank them for bringing that to your attention. Tension because you want to encourage them. If it has been a good resolution, you want to encourage them to bring more problems to your face like this and not let it Fester behind your back."

That's why I'm there and yes, there's all kinds of other benefits. There's a little bit of social benefit and of course, if it's a worthy job, a worthy organization, it's worth. You know you're doing good work or making the world a better place, but really, when it comes right down to it as far as increasing my status, increasing the amount of money that I make. That's what it's about with a job. And The maximizing of my money, I won't sacrifice doing a good job, but really, that's what it's about."

And also numerous times in community organizations and basically you just go in and introduce myself and get to know the people put myself out there as much as I can to show them the kind of guy that I am and I think That's the way to do it. Just dive in and meet everybody try to learn their names. I'm not very good at that. Sometimes try to try to get them to get my name right but you know really just get to know them and try to become part of the team, find out what the team needs and find out how I can fit in the team, what strengths I can bring and emphasize. What I can do."

Is there someplace else that I can do? Say it's a job where there's a certain number of tasks that are expected every day. Can I do the job? That's on the other side of the building for a little while to avoid the person just to avoid the conflict, avoid the annoyance. If the, I think that's where it would start. If I can't avoid the annoyance, try to put myself in the the other person's shoes a little bit and mostly just realize that I'm there at the job and if the person is annoying or you know, this is a situation where somebody annoyed me it's temporary, it doesn't matter that much. I can still do to do the work, do the job and just relax and get along with them. I find that's the easiest route. To avoid the stress, to avoid the conflict wherever I can."

You can kind of cluttered no it's organized. I know where everything is and I can work and you know, the more organized you are and the more you know where things are the more efficient you can be at your job. So So there can be times when another person if I have to share the work space where they aren't being very organized, but I can adapt with whatever organization system they have, and I can step in and get things a little more organized, a little better. I just think that the more organized things are the where, you know, the things are the better you're going to do. Working."

The strength obviously is being thorough to be able to do good job, for example. But the weakness of it might be, maybe you take too long with something sometime because you're too thorough. So there's a fine line between that being a strength or a weakness. I think it can be both and I think at times it is a it is both for me."

Also some it's very helpful and willing to do, whatever it takes to kind of make things go smooth and, and be happy, you know. You don't want that best friend to be sad because then you're going to be sad. So I think that's what my best friend would say. Generally, I think they would also say something to the effect. Act like they're, you know, that I'm punctual I don't like to be late for things maybe to a fault but I always said if you're, you know, if you're not early, you're late, that's kind of my model.

Is me just turning down certain positions, staying in positions. I had at the time because I thought they were better fit for me. Regardless of the money was more in the other position. I don't do my job just because of money like I money is great, when he is what we do this for, I guess. But we also for me anyway I do it because I don't want to be miserable. So I think I turn jobs down because of that knowing that a certain job would not be beneficial for me even though it was more money so that affected, you know, my status because it wasn't, you know, a higher position job. But at the time it was not a good fit for me in my my situation at home."

It's it's it's something that I can't take. Hide and you try to do a good job. Try to be, you know, nice about it for me. It seems like a lot of the people that have coming through, are not in the position, we were, they should be in was no fault of their own. So I try to take that into consideration as well and try to really understand things with them. But again, unfortunately, the turnover for one reason or another has been high and it starts all over again, constantly. And it can be Build and we're on a person but I try my hardest just to, you know, stay calm and and try to put myself in their shoes. Because if I was knew, I'd want to help and get the answers as well. So that's what I do with the new team and that's why I do it."

And I don't I'll admit I don't think I have the patience as I used to and that does wear on me where I have to try to keep things in and try to, you know, really stay calm. Like I mentioned in that in the last question, but I tend to become until I have to repeat myself a number of times. And I've gotten to the point more than once where I've had to get off the phone because I felt like it was ready to explode type of thing. I don't know if I would have but I find a way out thing and that's basically how I reacted is to get away. Take a breath and then go back to it."

I don't know if I'm as organized as I used to be and I think a lot of that has to do with just me not being in the office. I try to stay as organized as I need to be to get through the day and stuff. But I think overall when I might need to find that one file, you know, I might not know exactly where I put it there where it is, even at this point just because of the move to being remote. I think it's just not being in the office. Maybe has made me be a little more. More or less organized now. Luckily. I've got the experience and I can get through that. I think if I was starting over I think I'll be more organized because I'm you more worried about doing a good job. Not that I'm not worried what we're doing a good job now, but I just would be more worrisome new. So I'd want to press more so I think I would have the notebooks handy and had the pens handy. I'd have my notes organized right now. A lot of it is not that way when it always used to be that way partly. Also. I think it's because management has changed for Do it before under the management. I was at now. I feel like the management is a little bit disorganized as well. And I think that has made me more unorganized because of that if that makes sense."

I'm very analytical, I have leadership qualities. I'm very hard worker and I make sure to get the job done, no matter what some of my weaknesses, I'll say is probably, you know, I work, I overdo it sometimes. I don't know how to turn off the switch. Each when I am in the go mode. Sometimes I give too much. I put myself too much out on the line, and I Leave myself a little bit vulnerable. And sometimes I get a little bit, generally, I get absorbed a bit too much into my work and trying to perfect it as attend to be a perfectionist.

I'm very, I'm a very ethical person, very straightforward person. There's been numerous times where I've been presenting with, you know, under the table or kind of shady deals that I could probably profit off of and be able to, you know, come out on the good end. But my my gut and my just my more, our will now my moral, my morals and values will not allow me to be able to go ahead and behaving those such situation. Zai more honest and hard worker. I think I will probably be feel, I'll probably feel less of myself and feel kind of discouraged that I did soup to stoop to that level where I've always prided myself on being honest and just being honorable. And I think that it's just us the way I've been raised. I think that's just the kind of values and morals, that I was instilled with from a young age and just, you know who I am. So, you know, trying to be true to my values and to what I believe in is something that probably is Is why I made those decisions and react it and acted accordingly to you know, the situation and how I felt and what I needed. So I would definitely say my, my morals and values are definitely intertwined with my personal. I'm sorry my professional decisions and how I go about making those decisions on what, you know, business deals and whatnot. I do get myself involved in. So yeah, I would say that's definitely a big thing that affected my decisions."

Like I said earlier I'm very inviting and warm and welcoming so I do have a way with people connecting people and kind of talking to them and getting to know them and having, you know, sort of conversations where they'll enjoy my presence and be able to open up and kind of just, you know, be themselves as well and hit it off with me. So I'm very warm welcoming and people, you know, like me on very sociable. So I would say those People really do enjoy my presence. I think it's because of Just My overall personality, the way. I am. The way I present myself. You know. I'm no BS straightforward. I'm honestly, I can see that. I have good intentions. And I treat everyone with respect. So I don't think they will have any issues with that, I think they appreciate that. So yeah, that's definitely.

So situations where someone annoying me basically how I usually react in those situations is its try to calmly and professionally you know address it and directly address the issue and speak directly to them and not be blunt to let them know that this is bothering me and politely ask if they can stop or if they could change their ways and acting in accord. The way I'm looking, I feel like I do present myself in a reverie respect of perspectival, respectable Manner. And I treat One respect. So I don't think they will go ahead and take that as an offense or or take it in a slight your anyway. And I think I just learned from you know like I said we're my how I raised. And now my house born into my family, we were taught to treat people, how we want to be treated, you know, I have respect for others and you know I would definitely approach a situation with the utmost respect and just try to do it in a sincere way so they can understand how I feel and hopefully they can, you know, be relatable to how I feel about the situation."

Very organized like to have everything in a certain place, I like to be able to find something and have it in a certain place right now where everything is. I like to be very organized. I feel like that it leads to a more productive life and a more productive job performance. So yeah for me that is something that is very rare that happens and it's something that if it does happen, I probably cleaning it up and trying to get organized. You know, fairly quickly. And I just think that, you know, I've tried both ways and, you know, I've had experience in both ways and I've learned and the results showed me that, you know, being more organized, leads to better results being more prompt and be able to meet deadlines and be able to have the information at an arm's reach, you know, instead of, you know, search any kind of, you know, going going nuts and looking for it.

I don't really step up as a leader sometimes. Usually people are, someone else will step up and I would just follow their lead and it really depends on the situation. So if I Don't see anyone stepping up. Then I will take the responsibility and step up as it later but there is someone else who was willing to step up Before me then, just let them take the lead."

I don't really tend to be negative around my Paris or fund groups. I just like to hang out with them or have a good time, you know, just have fun. typically, I'm just A cool person to hang out with.

Usually, I behave pretty seriously in this situation because I really think about About what what is needed for for these decisions. And you know, this will ultimately affect my long-term goals and my career my future. And I think it's I think that's why I would behave seriously and that we were, like, joke around all these things. So typically I would tend to, Take it seriously. And Not.

And, you know, I, this is the time where I try to learn their names. What type of people that are, how do I get along with them? Or, you know, which type of people are which group of people and that team will not get along with. And I think this is I think I I think this was normal because I don't think I would be able to get along with everyone and new team of people are probably one or two people that I would probably not get along with. But generally with the rest of the team I probably get along with them. Yeah. Probably hang out outside of work, if that comes to it. But yeah, at first I would be pretty quiet.

Usually when someone annoyed me it it would take a lot to get like it would take a lot to provoke a negative response for me because most of the time I would deescalate the situation or just not take it to heart, I guess. but most of the times I just laugh it off or just try to change the topic or something and not really, you know, Make them feel bad for knowing me, or are you just calling them out or something? But generally, I am pretty patient with people who would like annoyed me.

Well, my greatest strengths would probably be. I am always on time. I am actually ahead of schedule when I go into work, I am there at least 20 minutes, early ready to start my day. I was make sure that I am on time other strengths include. I want to get the job done. I want to get started right. Right away, I want to get it done where it's correct quality-wise, not just efficiency but quality I think outside the box. A lot of times what I do like to do. One of my biggest strengths is I'm a people person. I love to get people motivated, whether that is by telling them, hello, have a great day, you know, kind of at a surprise way when things that I used to do was I would write on our Doctors, that went down to our Packers. Have a great day, you're doing a great job, you know, with a smiley face or whatever on there. Just a quick way to say, hey, you're doing great, come on motivation. Rather than them having to do the job continuously and never hear anything positive that you're doing. Great, you should always let your employees know you're doing great. Some of my weaknesses are. I am a people person and sometimes people like to take advantage of me for that that's not A good thing. So, you know, it does affect me. I do get personally, emotionally, I should say not really personally but I get emotionally involved with people. So when they're upset with me for something, I don't know why I want to get down to the bottom of it, and I want to see if I can correct it. You know, sometimes that means that I have to change myself and that's not always a good thing, being a manager, being a boss. So and I also Tend to feel badly, emotionally one, something like a employees, having a bad day. And a lot of times, I know, in the past, I've had employees have bad days because they've got something going on at home. And it really affects me when they, especially when they break down. You know, about it and want to really tell me what's going on and everything. It's hard. It really is not to get emotionally involved."

Well, I've never had one affect my status, but I have had a job where I'm affected my making money as far as professional decisions. I was a manager working for a cell phone company and what I was doing there was getting customers to sign on that needed help because Cuz they were low income families and we were offering phone service that allowed them to have. So many minutes for free for a month for calling and texting. It was not based on welfare or anything like that, but it was our own company that we were just offering this status and then if they wanted more minutes, they could purchase it at a reasonable price. One of the things I had to do was get out. As many customers as I could to sign on. If I wanted to make more money, this meant I had to make some decisions on areas that I wanted to go to low-income areas are very hard, especially in bigger cities because there's a lot of risk involved as far as just being outside offering these phones robbery, things like that. So I did have to make a lot of professional decisions because of that, There were a lot of things that we had to do. As far as signing people on, you had to make a decision of whether or not this person could be approved or could not be approved due to their own circumstances. So you know that affected how I made money to because every person that I signed on, I got a bonus for it. So definitely that was one of my jobs."

When I turned to join new team of people that happens quite a bit because I am my own company at the moment. I am self-employed. However, when I was employed and manager positions of different companies and places like that and just being a simple employee and not even being a manager. When I meet new people, I am actually very quiet person. I like to study. The room and see what's going on. I like to get to know the people to see what's happening. You know what, they're up to how they're reacting towards me, and how they're, you know, reacting towards others. A big part of that is because of my manager experience. But it's also because I'm quiet for the most part until I don't need to be quiet. The reason I am quiet is because partly is my ADHD. And the way I was raised. I was taught trained as being a manager, you know, various situations, you know, growing up, things like that. So most definitely, that's the reason I stay quiet and kind of stay in the background until I get to know somebody. And then when I do get to know the team, I am very active, very chatty.

Now when I started working from home, I had my kids still at home and a lot of times he needed a lot of help attention, things like that, due to his own health mental needs and things. And well, I have a, you know, understanding of that. I also got to the point. There are certain things that he can do and he knows that he cannot bother me while I'm working. I do get a little annoyed when that happens and he's done it several times in the past, not more recently but he has done it. How do I usually react in such situations? Well, I usually tell him, hey, you need to find something to do because Mom is working. This is very important. Mom is making money. Mom has to pay the bills. You know, I will explain to Why it is a lot harder as far as for me to do simply because he is mentality with him being autistic. He doesn't understand a lot of things. Normal. People would he would take it outside of the box instead? Why do I get annoyed while I kind of explained a little bit? I think it's more along, the lines of I need to get things done and I know a lot of times when you're dealing with somebody, He that has mental illness such as autism. It's very difficult, not to become frustrated easily. When you don't understand the situation, you're not familiar with autism and things like that. I'm familiar with it. I grew up with somebody that was autistic. So it's easier for me. So I really can't give situation or it's normal you know for me. Why Why do I get a little bit annoyed I kiss because he does understands on some situations that I have to work but then I have to stop and also think that he is autistic and sometimes he forgets and I have to remember that I have to repeat it and I just have to stay calm rather than get annoyed. I think maybe it's a little bit of my ADHD."

Well, it's pretty typical guys, I have ADHD. So my work space is organized, sometimes. And sometimes it's not. And why do I think that is? Is because I have ADHD, but to be quite honest, it's one of the things I'm really focused on. On working on because of my ADHD and being disorganized. It's one of the major symptoms lately. I have noticed, it has been a very big distraction for me and because I've noticed it, I'm starting to focus on it. One baby step at a time, getting it organized.

By example, I Well, Ted and motivate them to get a task done so that you can move on to something else a little bit morons exciting and enticing them or I won't pretend to be someone who speaks managing about it, and speaks to where things are laughing or will reach out and ask for help and putting the examples. Like when I worked in retail and people we're not going to clean. And so the story like I will go and be like this departments, if I mess, this is I'm doing But we might help you things like that. And I think, That I do to always sense of responsibility and kind of primary drives the annoyances. When other people don't feel that same sense of Duty and respect and just kind of doing everything with it - because I think that makes such a difference in my life with just taking pride in work."

For example, Are you two really think that how you do want, things how you do everything. And so I do try to take pride in my work, I take care of everything because I think even know that those things are important at all. It's up to something and I want to have my values and what may look like a face reflected in everything I do. So I think it's really important and it comes from a place of maybe a little bit of perfectionism but I think I'm sorry. The fan is loud and realizing that's kind of an issue in the mouth, but I will try to speak over so, Yeah, I think this is very interesting thing to not be working on instead of tend to be a very diligent clean organized person, that's just kind of behavior."

I'm just really detailed driven. I really like to get a project done as well as I can. That's a positive because it means I can have a very good result but it can also be a negative because I can get so driven so focused on details that it can end up taking me a lot longer because I tend to try to be a perfectionist. And because of that, sometimes I put too much time into things that don't need that much time into them. Sometimes it's hard for me to find that balance between, where do I really need to focus? A lot of detail, a lot of time in order to get the best possible result and where am I just be basically becoming to nitpicking and right? Could really kind of say, okay, that's good enough for what this needs to be and I could focus on something else. More important that really needs to get done. Yes. It's really the two of them. I also want to do like to learn new things. I'm very, very curious on the other hand I sometimes it can be difficult for me to learn new things, you know, at my age and my condition. So, again, that's a strength of I like to but a weakness for I'm not always able to do so many more do I was able to when I was younger before I have the dementia diagnosis. So that's my, you know, the two sides of the coin for me on that one, too. I don't know. Okay, I did. And I think, I guess it's time for me to stop on this."

I'm sad to say, but we have been best friends since 1981. So, I know her very, very well. If she's in a really upbeat mood, she would say very positive things about me. If she was struggling with depression, which she sometimes does, she would be focusing on the negatives, and the positives are that. You know, I do enjoy him. I love animals and I enjoy having fun into her both. Of those things from positive. I love to read she would point out all those things because those are all things that she and I have in common and she would see them as good things if she was in a negative mood. She would say that I'm argumentative because I I like to, I like to I like to research on something is wasted if someone says something and I don't it's like wait, that's not quite right or research it. And if I don't agree or I'm, if something that maybe already know about and I will tend to if I don't agree. Somebody there's data to back it up, I will say to them. Okay, you know, here's the evidence. Why what you're saying is not accurate. Sort of just letting it go and while there are people who like that, because they also like things to be very accurate and detail-oriented, there are other people who just kind of want to be free-flowing and she's very much a free-falling person and doesn't appreciate it. If I point out things, especially with something, like, I keep a detailed Daily Journal when I've done certain things. And if she says, we just something on a certain day. And I can go back to the journal. Say no, here's documented, proof of the day, it was on, she would not appreciate that. And we could say that I'm argumentative."

But making as much money as possible as never been a priority. For me, for example, I'm a vegetarian, I've been vegetarian since what 1976 now went to college, I became vegetarian and I got I was working at that now and I had, I love my job, but I saw a, there was a health food store that I went to regular and I noticed that the Only with the health food store was advertising for an executive position and what position I was qualified for though. I didn't know until I actually took the position that it actually on two of them that are turned out. Even basically, we just taking money out of the register without and not getting bills paid and stuff to health food stores in pretty bad shape, but it's heading toward bankruptcy, he brought me in hopes, they can make everything straight, but by then you're driven to so far underground, he couldn't and it got to the point where so bad, I eventually had to say to him. Look you can't afford me too. Stores in just such bad shape. That way. It's just stated that, no, not taking that break down. The time, I would have gone further in my career and Aetna. I did after that. I looked at, I did go back to it. Now, I also took a actually. I took a break from there. I went to clown for a while, what you wish me was very, very gently didn't earn a lot, but it was something that it was a very enjoyable interlude for me to make my living as a family Entertainer for a while and then I went back to Edna and continued on with my career. And some work there, I'm very proud of but if I I hit with my only goal was to make money. I was just stated at nine continue progressing my career, I would not have tried to help the health food on there because it will store that I believed in and I didn't want to go out of business and I wouldn't have taken the time to work on some family, Entertainer for a while, but that wasn't an experience that I will never have again in my lifetime.

When we created Jacqueline, there really weren't any other companies out there, Managed Care was still relatively new as was access to the internet, and there weren't a whole lot of other people out there putting together something by the customers. Could actually go online and type in to find out what doctors and providers want to network. And so, I mean, it was a completely new concept and I had a lot of the background of data enough to computer background for it. That wasn't my specialty. I was working on, was I do folks? Who knew that but I knew the date is at dock by needed to have in it. I knew I could I'd well I both worked a lot with a data and I also did customer service work. So I knew what kind of data are customers were looking for. So I was a key part of the team and when I joined it basically, my part was to find out who else was on the team. What? New what were the parts that I can contribute? And what I would need to do to explain to the technical people on the team because a lot of times they would go in and say, okay, well we can have this in this in this copy this and make and I'd have to go on to say no in this particular Network the, you know, the ancient damn seen the HMR or the MC is based on the aha moment. This one, the MC is based off the PPO. If you try to just make these all identical, it's not going to work properly, you're just going to confuse the customer and I also have to go Go in and tell them because the service point of view. So I need you to know who on the team I could work with and that's basically, you know, we're going into teams understanding the strengths and weaknesses of everyone else on the team, what I bring to it and how I can work best on the team."

Doesn't make any sense based on what I know, or I know enough to know whether what they're saying is not true. Now, going back to the previous example with the doc find one, sometimes as the example I gave, they would want to make all the MC data the same and I'd have to say sometimes no reason. This network DMC is baseball. Eh 0, and this network to the MCS based off the PPO. And if they would go ahead and say, okay, you're the one that knows the data, which I was, that's fine. We'll make the change all was well and good. But if it was a case where they would say, no, you know, we just think we should be able to do it all regardless, you know, or what you think today to says, then I would get an order to that. And of course, I would then go ahead and present examples. Okay, here, so Network were here, which was? It is, here's a network. Here it is. I don't just step back on someone that says something that. Is I know it's not true if I not sure it's not true, our research and bring them back to data. If I know it's not true. And I have the data at hand, I will give that to them. I don't just go ahead and back off. I like things to be exact. I like the angels, I like data. I like things to be precise. I like them to be the way that they're supposed to be. I get very annoyed when people just want to kind of cut corners and just, yeah, it's good enough. You know, I don't want just good enough. I want things to be right. If it's not Write it. I find that very very annoying anyway. That's um that's just pretty much space where go on there."

You say that's not organized. Well, do I know where everything is but my actual work. I organized online digitally. I do make some use of sheets and note that I basically have Evernote. Always open. I've got Evernote premium. I'm constantly working at Evernote to keep track of what I'm doing. Exactly, I started out the day by getting organized with. This is what I have my to-do list up there on my checklist of This is what I need to do throughout the day, isn't working on it. Okay, I've got this done and this is what happened here. I made this phone call. I document, what's here? I keep very, very organized but I keep organized digitally. So we might look at the workspace and say, wait a minute, really? Do you think that cat toy up there? Actually I do because when the cat comes over, once you start playing in the middle, I need to have the category at hand, so I can probably distract the cat and get back to work. So what might look at other people as unnecessary clutter on my workspace, everything here. It's got reason even though People looking at it might not think it so I and I do know where everything is. So yeah, it's typical need to have a lot of stuff around my workspace. Just so I have a close to hand if I needed even though it may look a little bit jumbled but my actual work does stay very very organized because as I said, I were constantly in every note, make sure that I keep a list of every single thing that I'm doing, I don't. I couldn't keep track of all the way because I did mention earlier in this interview. I do have dementia and I can't remember things anymore. I'm a, I used to back when I worked on top of Pi, still had all this stuff memorize which was able to be on the dock find team and say, okay this has to be here, here here and xyc but I can't do that anymore in order to do the work I do. Now I have to be able to constantly document exactly what I've done, what I need to do. So is this is So yeah, I would say that it's very, very typical to have my work very organized and has to be. Alright, I can't function anymore and my workspace looking maybe not to organize, but practical and usable for me."

If I'm asked to do something, I will do it. Maybe I don't want to do it. Maybe I don't like doing it but I will do something that I'm asked to do. And the quality will be at least average. And also, So just very reliable to to be there. I think being present and beyond that getting the job done and doing this consistently is this is something that most people think is very common, but in reality, it's not somebody that doesn't sound special but pretty much whatever the task is. I get it done."

You know, or as honest, when it really matters because you know being honest all the time is not good, nobody likes anyone who a person who is honest all the time people are, sometimes you onto honest but also sometimes people aren't nearly honest enough. And so I guess my best friend would describe me as someone who, when they really need to know, really need some solid honest advice, then she knows that she can come to me."

I mean, the first thing that comes to mind, there would be being offered some type of promotion. Or an offer from another organization that could increase employment or, you know, incoming status, I guess, the first thing I think of is, obviously, how will this positively affect my life? What can the higher amount of money do for me and status? I guess what, you know, my new set is, how will how, well can that reflect upon me? Me and also I think about loyalty to loyalty something very important to me. So it has to be a really really good offer and where I would feel comfortable I guess Comfort is this another thing that comes to mind?"

I've observed that I perform usually really well when I enter a new team, in fact, better perform better at the beginning than I do. Then I do like while I've been on the team for a long time I guess because I want to make a really good first impression. I don't I don't want to appear incompetent. I do you know, why do I think I don't want to appear incompetent? I think part of it is about job security. And you know just relationship security. If you start off on the wrong foot in any situation, it's hard to dig your way out of that I think really. That's that's my instinct."

That's my the first thing I do to, you know, if I can't remove myself, then reduce engagement with this person as much as possible, I'm generally a non-confrontational person. And so you know my experience with is with a person who's annoying. They're usually really bad at taking criticism and feedback so engaging them and a dialogue about their behavior. I don't think that it's going to help the situation and I'll probably make me feel worse. So if I can, I just totally disengage"

I'm not disorganized the point of being just horribly like ugly, work site, but I don't think it's good. I guess I just get I get very used to a routine coming in seeing the same thing and frankly, at that moment I wasn't really happy with my job. So, I think, I think a messy workspace is kind of a reflection of how you feel about your job and how you feel about the way that people look at you at your job. So if you don't really care the way that you work spaces and you probably don't really care about your job that much, and that's was a good description of me."

I remember conversations I had with people from a long time ago when I worked at the sub shop. I kept track of what people ate four sandwiches whether name was last thing we talked about. So I definitely see my greatest strength is my memory and I'd say my greatest weakness is I'm not the best at stuff right away, it takes me time to get good at stuff and I definitely don't have the confidence to back myself, and that doesn't help me. So I'd definitely say that's a weakness. Another strength I have is my ability to keep pushing keep working hard. Keep trying to figure something out. I mean, every job of worked at. I've almost risen all the way to the top. I mean, not the very top wasn't the owner, but one of the last job I worked at the owner, actually talk to me about possibly buying into the business for one. He retires.

Some of the goes out of their way to be friendly. Generally, I'd say that. They would say I'm a hard worker, try to always be working and getting stuff, done, trying to always be making money, pulling in, help out with stuff.

The other employees didn't need to feel afraid of this employee and my boss definitely could have said okay no I don't care what you say and so Definitely could have affected my status. I believe that I just kind of do what needs to be done. I he needed to be like, go he needed. A not stay working for the company. I mean, a definitely saves the situation that I made a professional decision. And also there was a time that a customer, got a free sub like a 13 dollar free. So and they called and complained, that it was messed up, and I knew for a fact that it wasn't messed up, because I'm the one that made it. It and I told him just that I said I'm not giving you a free sub for a free sub when I know that I made it right it didn't matter if it affected my professional status or not.

I mean, you do your work and then it all gets its money and all gets put away. It's not like it's sitting out there. Can't leave the money sitting around. You don't leave the transaction sitting around. Check skip. Put away. And when I worked at the sub shop, I didn't really have a works. I mean, I guess I'd workspace kind of in the back because I was the one that opened and do with the money and stuff, but I would take care of the paperwork and then put it in its respective folders. So it's not like I could just leave that sitting out either because there's a chance and employees would mess it up or excellent, throw it away when they're back there, doing with their delivery bags.

You're not always going to get along and I get frustrated, often that being said, it is a workplace at the end of the day and I like to keep things professional. So generally I'll just kind of keep it to myself. Focus on getting my work done. If it's bothering me in the way that I work, I'll bring it up, nothing in a dramatic way or anything. The if I think it's going to cause something, I'll take it to a leader instead, but I just usually try to not give it too much attention because that's going to make things worse and the point of work isn't for me to focus on my relationships within work anyways. So as much as it sometimes people bother me and I would like to just hash it out right away. It's not always the right answer and that's why I tend to just stay more reserved and focus on work instead."

Personally, I tend to stay on top of cleaning and keeping things organized as much as possible because one I don't like to sit around and do nothing.

So you can find things easily access things easily because the more mass you have the more you're going to have to deal with that. The end of Of the day. And it'll make things a lot easier for people. I think that because I'm a perfectionist. I like to have everything set in place where it's supposed to be.

Well, I'll figure things out on my own, but I take Direction very well. I like being told what to do. my weaknesses kind of our, I'm not very creative and I'm not very Idea oriented, I guess would be the best way to put it. I do work well with others. Again, they can if they're good at telling me what to do. As an employee while I get along well with people. I don't have drama that I know of. I can separate personalities, I guess the work from the social so to speak, as long as other people are good about doing that to, you know, I may not care for a person but you know, we work well together."

It doesn't typically pay as well as what the previous field was. But that's when during that time, I got pregnant with my daughter and feeling really tired, all those early weeks of pregnancy and things like that. And there's no real reason why I couldn't work or working this job, but I can, I kind of knew. OK, and on one sore for a while. After she's born, I'm probably not going to want to Want to work a be able to so I just made the decision even though we could have used the money and experience further during throughout the pregnancy at least until the baby was born. My name is decision not to go back to work to not bother to get a job while I was pregnant. Not knowing how long I'd stay stay home.

So one year, when everybody is kind of, I guess the, the parents that had been doing it before the kids had graduated moved on out of elementary school and I've been helping out. So I'm kind of a nominated in an unofficial sense, which I didn't really like doing that. Even though the role that I was nominated for was Treasurer, which is of all the major roles in The organization like the PTA or Association like that. That's more my Niche. Anyway, I'm handling the money and things like that. And It's, it's nerve-racking because again, treasure, it was good. President wouldn't have been. I don't like being in charge of other people. I like kind of being told what to do, and having clear-cut instructions. So, I don't know, I don't like being charged of other people and bossing them around even if I know what I'm doing. So rather not very task-oriented which is just my hyper analytical logical brain suppose, You know, I can do the tedious and they weren't work grunt work, which is probably why, you know, most people shy away from being a treasure.

So I guess I don't really know how I would act react right now because you know, after having my own daughter, things changed somewhat at least how I react with her and groups of kids, don't know. I'm usually able to redirect a Ocean. But see, again, that's with me, being in charge of other people, which I typically wouldn't be, unless I was in charge of children in my previous roles. I, so, with them, I guess I can kind of get on their level so I can kind of break the tension that way. I guess I'm kind of childlike myself and understand them know how to communicate with them. It comes to adults. Again, if we're talking to work environment had a boss or two that were that, I was quite annoyed with at times, either overall, or very specifically Pacific Tasks. And I'm not saying that doesn't go well. I know I'm not saying that, you know, I let it show that I'm annoyed but I generally try to if it's something I feel like they've done that.

I will do my best to try to approach them about about, you know, what why the confusion happened that might have annoyed me if they weren't perhaps clear on what they wanted me to do or how oh, they wanted me to prioritize something so basically I would you know want to clear guidelines about what was expected"

I like orderly doesn't who doesn't I want orderly? It's I work better orderly and organized feel better but if I try to multitask that's usually where Are the mess happens and then at some point, you know, then it all goes to pot. So I would say maybe at some point during any given job tasks depending on how long and involved, it is, it does become pretty typical that it gets disorganized sometimes rather quickly and it's just the multitasking. I feel like I can do a little bit of everything all at once or maybe don't think that, but that's how it works out or I'm like, okay if I get this piece done first, then I'll go back to ooh, this and then that time never called them and I don't end up going back to that.

And so half the time, I won't even take a lunch because, well, you know, I could do this. And as soon as I do that, I'll wait lunch. So so that's I think a weakness, just know when to say when you know, pulled the plug, take a break. It's not that big a weakness but a strength I definitely said being thorough and conscientious doing an effective job getting job done. Like I said I don't like to leave Loose Ends, but seems like there's always a loose end somewhere in each tied up. So I'm going to go with that."

And I, you know, I'm truly confident that if I use all my Powers, I can accomplish any task, I'd say related to that my greatest weakness as an employee. I don't say no, I believe. Like I said, I believe I can take on any task regardless of how many, You know how much is on my plate already? And That may lead to me not taking on too much or more than I can handle, but I generally have a pretty full plate. So to speak, you know, everything interests me and I'm always down for a challenge.

I think they'd say that I treat people fairly because I think that's really the best way to accomplish a problem together is for everyone to, you know, be in a good headspace and you do that by treating people.

And what I mean by that is, you know what, matters, the objective, how you get there in the most ethical way, not doing what's good for you to get another promotion or something like that? But what's good for the organization and then, keep in mind, what's the goal of the organization? So, I mean, ideally working somewhere with that aims to help people and if you Center that question and then you're gonna lead to good results.

You'll know who's best for Particular task and who works well with each other and if there's anyone who doesn't work well with each other, if you go and prepared, then you'll probably on the path to a good result. And if you take the effort to remember who you're dealing with, people want to know that you're paying attention to what they tell you that they'll respect that and no. To work with you. And if you've got everyone on board, you know, to do a good job, then I think you're going to get good results.

Take too many breaks. People who don't clock out for breaks, especially young people who don't play by the rules. Yeah, because I, you know, I typically show up ready to do what I'm told. Exactly, that's the best practice to those rules. Are there for a reason? I tend to be very punctual generally. I don't miss days. I believe a team is only as strong as its weakest link. And sometimes when we got multiple weak, links, that really puts a lot of pressure on your harder workers. And due to being a harder worker. You know, I've seen how that command pet, pull that tivity and, I've seen what happens when productivity is impacted it really get all travels uphill and I don't know how I react.

I would say that level disorganization is not typical. Most places are better organized than that. That but in this scenario, the person in charge is just not up to the task and it showed that in several different ways. Sometimes people get promoted when they shouldn't.

Decisions decisions that can affect my status, you know, like how I'm looking as far as as far as certain numbers go and etcetera and how or you know how much money I make like on a commission basis. I'm always going to try and think, you know, I could, is there a short way to do this? That's going to have like a big impact right now or it? Is there a long way to do this? It could have, you know, maximum returns over time and it's going to end up creating a better relationship. Up with the business with the customer, you know, and a better face for everyone involved. I want to try and make everything is positive as humanly possible and I just think that that's common sense and I think that it's what happens when you care about other people. And when you, when you believe in what you're doing,"

So when I joined a new group, a new team of people new group of people than a kind of split my time somewhat uneven, you know, it depends on this. It depends on the group. Everything is dependent on context but I'll try to split my time between, you know sitting back and watching Beyond being a little quiet, a little bit quiet but not you know, an Engaged but I'll sit back and I'll watch the Dynamics at play. So I can kind of get an idea of you know, who's friendly with who you know where. Rizz you know where's communication being exercised where it's not being exercised are there? King saw there are they're really strong bonds that need to be minded and I take note of that. But you know I for the most part, I do try to do that simultaneously with what with like face-to-face engagement and interaction. I think that's because I just get a better feel for how people are overall when I can talk to them face-to-face, ask them you know fairly direct not rude not boundary Crossing but you know fairly direct questions about Our interests are and you know where their strengths lie because I want to get to know people on, on a purely strengths-based basis because people know what their weaknesses are or yeah. Or they show up over time. And that's something that a group Works around. But a person should be able to be individually proud of their strength. So that's, that's why I like to get to know how people view themselves, you know, on the positive front and in people in a group setting will usually piggyback on that. Especially if the bond is good. So yeah, I love meeting and joining, you know, new teams of people."

For the most part generally when I am annoyed, I, it's because of some kind of intentionality behind the other person's actions. You know, it's normally a specific, some specific action or communication. Some kind of words that were were very pointed and directed at me and that's so rare. It's almost difficult to think of, you know, it's almost Hard to think of specific instances. But, you know, in the rear occasion that it does happen, my whole thing is to is to disengage, or deescalate and walk away because that person could just very well be having a bad day. But yeah, it's really, it's really, really hard to annoy me at all with just normal off-the-cuff actions. It has to it has to be targeted towards me and that case. Yeah, I always just like to drop it, you know, To drop it as fast as possible. And disengage give that person time, give me time, and that's just because everybody deserves their best possible shot. And some people they're not going to, they're not going to hear it at the moment that they're they're they're, you know, they're not going to hear critique or correction at a moment when they're feeling angry enough to have or annoyed enough to have those kinds of interactions.

So the first would be if I'm juggling things in very in, like, vastly different domains. So, you know, if like let's say it's cool, right? I've got five different subjects and it's hard to kind of keep everything straight. And, you know, you try to a bunch of different systems that can be difficult and, you know, I still managed to get really organized then but sometimes stuff slips or Or, you know, if I've got something from one department or something for another and or do you know it just different tasks from from from different areas? Sometimes, I find that a little difficult, although that's usually like a momentary lapse and number two, would be, I guess like my computer desktop because I have from, cuz I have several computers, I use for different work purposes because they're on different operating. Teams. And so like, I have a different organization system for my file system on each of them and I really need to unify it and make it so that it's all, it's all the same across them. But I'd that is that it is actually an exceptionally messy situation. Sometimes when I'm either forgetting, how I manage things on this computer or thinking I have a file that's actually on a different device. Yeah. So that can that can get pretty messy and I will say it, I need to work on it."

My ability to dedicate myself to my field, and to continue to learn, and my desire to always improve and to do the best job that I am capable of doing my weaknesses as an employee typically, not as good with computational and analytical types.

So I have to first, look at what the goals are the projects that the teen need to accomplish. And I need to kind of prepare in advance, how I would best fit into the team so that I could offer suggestions and guidance along those lines. I would go out of my way to research some of the projects that would need to be done and to also meet individually with the team members to kind of build my comfort and confidence level."

So, I do try to take a moment aside and think of the Viewpoint of the person that from from where the issue arrived, a lot of times, it might be a miscommunication. Indication or a misunderstanding. So I like to explain to the person the situation so that we can both get a better grip on it in order to come to an understanding and solution."

Well technically that is not very typical of me as I do like organization and I do like planning and I do like to have everything categorized either on my desk or on the computer. There have been times when I've worked on more than one project and I'm not I wasn't able to Recall or get ahold of that information as quickly as I would have liked to.

Sometimes I like the challenge of trying to figure things out by myself that can lead to me getting stuck at times, so that's definitely something I can work on in the future. I also have a tendency to want to do things, you know, the perfect way or the right way. Typically? And so there are times when I can get Focused on details. That might not be the most important because I want it to be just right. Which? And while I will still be able to get the things done on time as necessary. Maybe I've focused too much time on the wrong things because I want to get it just right as far as my strengths, I am very flexible and adaptable. You know, I'm very, I can work with very different situations, are very different people. I can change tasks and change my goals very quickly. If need be You know, I'm willing to to give up on some of its not working. If I feel it's not right, and change course to do something new. So you know, I'm good at kind of good at improvisation and thinking on my feet and changing things would need be I think one of my other students is also communication. I am good at, you know, speaking with people with people with your written and verbal communication as well. So I think those are things that typically I'm good at you know I'm also Also pretty easy to get along with and, you know, a good team player.

I definitely work hard and focus on what I need to get done. But when it's, when it's time to have fun, I definitely want to just kind of enjoy myself and not be too stressed or worried about anything. They probably would also call me. Very giving and very, very kind, maybe to a fault sometimes. I think they would, they would tell you that, you know, I'm willing to do anything for them, or for anyone really even sometimes too much to my own detriment. You know, I can sometimes put others before myself too much, you know, I believe she actually called me an obligor the other day. You know, someone who, you know, wants to please others. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. You know, I can, I can definitely see where that could be, you know, have its problems. But, you know, I just, I enjoy helping people and I think they would kind of see it the same way. They would also say that I am, you know, kind of silly and goofy and funny as well that I'm, you know, I do I try to take things too seriously that I'm pretty light-hearted.

I mean, I know that's important and, you know, I'd been enough money to survive. But money is definitely not my motivating factor status can be a little more important just because I do want to be respected and I do want to be listened to and I want to be seen as someone who knows what they're doing. So, you know, they're very different situations for me but for me status is more about how do people see me as having Out a group or help the community or help the team or maybe or maybe helped a company to get better, you know, to grow to be better. So status is necessarily like a promotion, or a higher title, or a higher rank or anything like that. It's more about, you know, how I've helped people, I've helped individuals or how I've helped a company, you know, as far as money again. I know it's important personally to me, it's not the biggest motivating. Factor. I'm more concerned about being socially conscious, you know, environmentally conscious help my community. Uplifting, the people around me and so you know what, my professional decisions might. Not always be the most profitable for me or might not result in, you know, the greatest personal benefit for me, you know, I see that there's thing larger than myself out there and I want I'm sure that meant want to make sure that my decisions are looking too good for everybody."

And so generally speaking, I'd like to come in and find out how I'm going to fit into that. I don't want to. I do not like to come in and, you know, push people around or create my own systems, you know. I do want to belong. I do want to fit in. I want to be a part of the, the flow, the solution. I don't want to, I don't want to be the problem, you know. I do think that if I have ideas, that could improve the way things are being done, I will volunteer those. And I will point out things that I think, you know, could be better. It could be different. But I don't want to shake up the dynamic, they have. It's already working very well. You know, also, I can be just generally a little bit quiet, when meeting new people or when in a new situation because I like to sort of understand the lay of the land and How things are already working before? I inject? My own personality too much into that to disrupt things because I know that, you know, a small disruption can cause big waves later on. So, you know, the biggest thing for me is that again, I want all of us to be successful. This is not about me. Succeeding or me having my own way r or leading to something. It's about the team doing well, you know, I feel that even if I'm coming in to lead a team, a good leader listens to the people around them and responds to them and supports them and that you're only as good as the other people you're working with and then if you don't appreciate the talent they have and they bring in the dynamic, the group has, then you're not going to be successful."

I do think that, that one of my virtues is that I am a very patient person. I am a very calm person. You know, I don't get irritated or angry very easily and so, I can sort of keep my cool and usually try to find some way to defuse the situation. So, that if someone is annoying me, I'll use humor. Or I'll try to get to know that person better or all four more. A better relationship with them to try to avoid that in the future, you know? Or if I if it is something that is, you know, harmful in some way. I would definitely, you know, have a Frank discussion with them about how their behavior is affecting, you know, me how it might be affecting other people have I be affecting themselves without them realizing it. You know, the biggest thing for me is that introducing more anger and more negative energy into that situation. Ation isn't going to solve anything, it's probably just going to escalate whatever is already going on. And you know keeping it behind someone's back or just ignoring it isn't isn't really a solution either. So, you know, finding a way to address it in a kind, but sort of reaffirming supportive way is, I found works best for me. So, you know, not not trying to get someone in trouble, not trying to call someone out. Not trying to accuse anyone or make anyone feel bad, more about, you know, Guiding that person toward positive behavior. You know, showing them through my own actions, through my interactions with other people, through the examples of others around us about how they can adjust their behavior to better integrate with with those around them."

You know, things can look kind of haphazard, but I know where things are. Even if other people can't necessarily find them and again, well, that could be problematic because of someone, you know, needs to run to my desk, or my office, whatever, and grab something. They might not be able to find you right away. Well, I could tell them, hey, it's you know, in the third stack halfway down or it's in the you know, the second pocket This this briefcase or whatever that meant that that might not be the most helpful thing, you know, for them because they get a good digging through stuff to try to find it. But like I said, I know where things are and I keep things organized in a way that makes sense to me. So, you know, keeping like things together or having them placed in certain locations that makes sense to me. So while things may look messy and may seem disorganized, you know, I certainly Personally, I am organized even though it might look that Mom, I look differently to someone else. You know why it is? I don't entirely know. I've just I've never really been a very neat person. I've kind of like the chaos sometimes because it can keep things. Like, for me, especially like, you can keep things closer at hand, something's, not tucked away. It's out for me to see, look at the grabbed interact with.

So we moved on and I can see that they're anxious for the rest of the tour, but we've gone and later on, after tour is finished, and they all left.

And now it's late and you have to explain to the customer and everything but it's not important to stay calm in those situations. because, A cooler head prevails I think and it's the fastest way to rectify the situation.

As they want someone that they can, they can work with that can still kind of guide them with the overall principles of what they're doing. And I feel like I'm pretty successful at that."

Probably most of the time when people are just being unreasonable you know, and there's no talking sense into them you know you're not going to build a bring them over here point of view, I find in those situations. It's better just to sometimes just deescalate walk away. Most situations don't require that they be resolved, someone's being extremely difficult or annoying. There's no reason to waste your time on that. You can just go ahead and and like I said, deescalate then maybe come back to the circle back."

To get that scheduled a month or two ahead of time rotating Vehicles, you get it, having a spare spare vehicle for a person. So I get their truck done.

I think that I responded this way just because I'm very non-confrontational, I don't like stirring the pot if it's not necessary but at the end of the day it is my comfort ability level at work and it was just getting too far.

A little I want to say like, he wanted to punch somebody, which is so aggressive. And there's a time where we upsetting me really more time the inside when he went to buy LM used by an Alpine doing. Is buying a box showing cigarettes in this man. When I bagged his vodka, he claimed that I was this horrible worker and this bad person because I bagged his arm macaron and really, you know, I understand this man probably really struggling life. I'm not sure if he was struggling his house whole life or he was telling, they didn't really have love in his life or if it is job. Was so stressful, but it really he was a person. I understood that try. It was projecting himself out as if his anger and his hurt even though it did still have me on the inside, they soak up the smile on my face. I told him, they hope you have a nice nice night that night because I don't see him all the time. But It just makes me sad more when I see that situation in why that is. And once again, I'm a person like that because I grew up around that environment where you have to try to be the nicest. Most understanding person that you can be able to long long way in. I want to say to marriage in life, your relationships and anything. It's going to go far away for just that honest loving person that you are and you show. That other people, it isn't to make a difference even if it doesn't seem like it does, thank you."

So I've been with the company for over ten years down and although I'm not a supervisor or a little older, I go based off of common studies available on prolific when it comes to decisions. So you put the freezer stuff posted to the truck, the In the truck. That's where the cooler unit is that you have the cooler stuff and you have the dry stuff. You have the heavy Drive stuff more on the beginning. Part next to the coolers that the lighter dry stuff is easy to get on and off the truck and pour it around is going based off of what time the route supposed to go.

I usually take it as a individual type of situation, so I don't base it. I don't base my decision from one situation based on the previous one I made it's all customized situation. Why are they ask me for stuff is basically they can't find a supervisor and they figured that, you know, I've been the office long enough to have some type of experience and ultimately I let them the selector or loader, make the final say so it's just they bounce ideas off of me and I bounce them off of them, we come up with a common ground either that or the supervisor will show up and won't ask them. How to solve it. So,"

I've had situations where I was supervisor and it was with a group of people who didn't take responsibility for their actions.

I think something that was necessary though, was asking the sustainability of my role after I left because there weren't people on the team who could do the things that I could do and the skill level. I had was not appropriate for the internship. Moving forward for the intern to do all of these things. It was clear that a new full-time World needed to be expanded, even if I wasn't going to be the person to take on that role, So something I voiced as I was getting closer to the end of the internship was saying, hey, I'm recognizing that these tasks, what's that leave aren't sustainable for for this program. Are there ways that we can automate some of these tasks that we can transfer them to your rule, to a different rule? Like how can we make this? How can we expand what we're doing?

I don't believe in doing things halfway. I'm not one of those people and I really really don't like repeating myself or my work. So I think it's very important to do things right the first time and I think that that is what my friends would say about me that I am a bit of a perfectionist that I believe in getting things right the first time and that I am also a bit of a germaphobe I like to keep things clean. Not sure that belongs in there but there it is."

I'm not afraid to do things the way I think they should be, especially Really if it improves in fish efficiency and productivity. So I, there are times when I, you know, doing that people don't understand why, or how, or what I've been changing. And what the purpose is because they're so used to falling on a black and white line. And when I go off in my own Direction, and try to accomplish more, or do better than it, takes a moment for people to realize what I'm doing occasionally. So, It could have affected me and I'm I do that because that's who I am. I believe in always trying to improve things around me. Awesome."

That was the last time I have referred pain that I worked in education and I changed teams when I changed my schedule. And I came in to that team as a very high performer. So it was really important to me that I maintained my level of performance so that I could bolster the numbers on the team that I was joining because you want to begin. I would like I did that because I would like to be considered an important part of the team. I would like for other people to be to believe be happy that I join the team. He won't. You don't want to come onto into a new situation with different people and and they they don't want you there. Foot that ideally you want to become, you want to integrate. I mean, regardless of, whether you're hiking, former, he's still want to integrate and get along with the people on your team and the you want to do good to show that you value the people around you.

So as much as possible and I stayed I kept myself on a schedule that we nothing. We get forgiven forgot about and then we could always prepare the next shift would be prepared coming in and they wouldn't have to do my work. And there were two, I often found that when I would come into work, I would have to do all of the previous just work. Including my own that was extremely annoying and wrong. And so, why do I think I was annoyed because It's not you have these expectations around you of your co-workers say that they are going to work the way you do or that they are going to perform at least at some close to some level of where you do. And I think that's just the way we do things. If something's expected to me, why should it not be expected? Everyone else? And that's just not the way things work.

What will make me happy and what will make me feel fulfilled? Recently, I quit a job that had fairly decent pay in exchange for one that would be more fulfilling. I am taking a pay cut but you know, that's I was miserable at my old job. What's important to me is to do Do something that matters to feel like I have worth in the work that I'm doing. And yeah, just just feel like I'm making a difference. And, you know, I want to say having fun at work but not in like, the goofing off, slacking off, kind of way. But just like, you know, that's saying if you do what you love, you never work a day in your life. So that's usually what drives my professional decisions. And in terms of making money, Me. Like that's a little less important to me than doing something. That is fulfilling and makes me feel good."

They probably weren't intentionally trying to annoy me, or maybe they're doing their best, and we're just at different skill levels or stages in our life. So I try to not let it affect me. Like, if I can, I like to remove myself from Situations that might be generating negative emotions. Or if it's something small like say we're Cube mates in an office and they chew their gum really loudly or something, if I can correct it through my own actions, like wearing headphones and listening to music to block out distracting noises. That's probably my first course of action and if that's not an option than I'm not afraid to say, so, Something, you know, I lived in dorms when I was in college and a big takeaway from that is that you really have to have open honest communication with people in order to live harmoniously because people don't always know that something they're doing is annoying someone else and they're not mind reader's and it's really easy for like resentment to build if these small things go unaddressed. so,"

So, I worked underneath or jointly with the main English teacher at that school, who's like always there and I love her to Pieces. She was amazing, but she was not very organized so that Wasn't. Really a challenge because I am really organized. So, it just took me like, I felt like awesome. There's something that I can like really contribute to making her life easier to making the kids life easier by getting this space put together, so I definitely did that. And yeah, I I'm a really organized person when it comes to my work spaces and I feel like if it has become unorganized, then I will take the little time to organize it because that really keeps the flow going like, you know, I need a pen. I always know our pain is, if I need paper. I always know papers, you know. So I just really value an organized workspace and love organizing. If I encounter not organized workspace,"

But because I'm aware of this weakness. I can control it and I know when it's happening as far as also, being a strength, I often catch things that others Miss and that can be very helpful in Bringing something to the project.

This could include say, Stuff like bolt 8 in certain areas like an ice machine that are often neglected by restaurant owners. So I would say attention to detail is one strength, I have.

I wouldn't stay like a people pleaser bomb. I try to go with the flow when I'm at when I'm part of a new team like I don't want to step on anybody's toes. I think that could be because I'm new.

If I'm, I gave someone a chance to him, fix the violation multiple times, and they ignored it or If they treated me like I was stupid or kind of took advantage of me as a health inspector, I would probably get a little cranky. Like I said, it does take a lot to get me annoyed, but I would probably react in that way because I try to look for the best in people. And at that point when you've given so much, so many chances to them. Correct.

So these are going to be things like thermometers test strips a flashlight, and a mirror, and our rating cards, which are super important because that's how the public knows what rating and Guy and it kind of helps them to make informed decisions about where they eat. So one day I was at it inspection. I had done quite a few before that and I made it all the way to the end. The establishment and question is very good. So they were going to get an excellent rating card. Um, I rifle through my case that I realized with horror that I was, in fact, out of excellent rating cards. So I couldn't just give them a satisfactory because they didn't deserve that and I couldn't not give them a rating card, so not a good situation. I ended up having to um I let her keep her old rating card while I drove back to the office to get a new one. Yeah, and I had a good day. The things like that. Don't usually happen. I think it happened that day because I was doing so much to him, get our County caught up. And I think I probably should have stopped after each inspection and taking an inventory of all my equipment and I probably should have I probably should have started keeping spare rating cards like extra of everything in my County vehicle because that could have been avoided. I think I just got a little ahead of myself that day."

Any decision that I made that would affect the timeframe that it took a task to get done more across the country or many, that would be a professional decision that would affect my job or planning out and delegating tasks that needed to be performed be performed within a certain time frame.

I guess because at work, I focus on work and I just tend to hyper focus on work.

I've been involved with teams as small as 2 to 3 or as large as 40 people. And in, when it comes to working in a team, I think my biggest asset is knowing what I need to be a leader and what I need to follow and just be a team player. I think great, leaders know when to follow and good followers know, when it's time to step up. And I think that I am really good at being able to identify my role on a team. My greatest weakness that I would see as an employee Is that sometimes I don't really know how to set my boundaries in a job environment and that can lead to some pretty quick burn out. I try to stay, you know, on a task as long as possible, I don't take very many breaks and that can lead to just fatigue and what I'm doing which might output a lesser product than what I could be giving out. And I think overall, just not necessarily knowing when to take a break or to step back from something and then return to it at a later time."

Someone who's going to stick with the people that I have around me, even when it's not easy. I don't love having to go out and find and just like a choir. A whole bunch of new people that I know superficially. I really like getting to know people in a deep and intentional level. And when I plant roots I want them to be deep roots. So I don't like moving around all the time or doing a whole bunch of different things. I'm very content in my routines. And so I think that's where that loyalty comes from is just liking the routine that I have, and the people that I'm with and knowing that, even if it might not be best for me individually. If it's best for the group that I am with or best for the relationship that I have with that person, that is the decision. I'm going to make it's going to be for the betterment of the whole group, or for the entire for the entity rather than just for myself personally. So, I think that's where that loyalty comes from."

I think. You know, usually I choose whatever is going to be best for my mental and emotional health in the long run and going to be best for my relationships in the long run. Both professionally. And personally they've been plenty of times where I've opted to make the lesser amount of money. Because in the long run, it was going to benefit other areas of my life that weren't just necessarily those financial areas. In terms of my status, I think it goes hand-in-hand. That the things that I've turned down that we're more money, were also things, that might have been more status. And I think I behave in that way because I just I truly value my outside life outside of my career more than I do my career and a lot of different ways. Not that I don't value the work that I do but I think I just recognize that there's more to life than a career or a job. So that's that's why I tend to make those decisions."

If I enter a group of introverts on the one that takes the step forward, and I think I just do that because, you know, in the ladder and the group of introverts. I take, I'm normally just extroverted generally. So in a group of introverts, it's really easy for me to be the extroverted one. And somebody has to be the first one to talk. So I'm okay with being that person and a team where it's a lot of extroverts. Even if it's not necessarily my first instinct to be the one that used to never be my first instinct to take a step back, it is now because I recognize that it adds more. A better Dynamic to the team. When there's a lot of loud voices in a room, you don't need to be another loud voice, and so learning to just kind of accommodate the group in that way. I think I do that because I've discovered the group works best in the long run. If there's somebody to do that to know, when to lean out or went to lean, in is a really important aspect of knowing how to function in a team. And so when I join a new team of people, I tend to just be adaptable to whatever the dynamic is of that. Team it is only once I've discovered what the dynamic is that I will start to insert myself, maybe in different ways or take myself out after realizing the group of introverted people maybe aren't actually that introverted after the first couple of minutes of being together. So I just tend to kind of go back and forth depending on what the team needs for me at that point."

I tend to just walk away, I don't Know that, that is the best reaction all the time. I think I walk away because if I don't those feelings of annoyance will just continue to fester and if it's especially a work relationship that I'm going to have for a longer period of time. It's not just a one-off conversation with someone that I'm having in the moment. If this is a relationship that I'm going to be expected to work with this person on a weekly even daily basis. It's best for me to just kind of walk away from a situation that annoys me I tend to have a good internal radar of when that point is, as to when I need to walk away. Just for the sake of maintaining a cordial relationship."

So if it's, if it's not very organized, that doesn't feel very typical of me and I think it's probably The only time where times more, I'm not organized in my workspace. Is when I've taken on too much and while taking on a lot is typical of me compared to other people there. Obviously, it's everyone's point. My point. I think is just higher than other people's. And so it usually is just a sign that if my workspace physically, or just like workload, generally is not organized. It usually means I need to take a step back from whatever I'm doing and re-evaluate and try to delegate some of my tasks to other individuals. Because it's just simply too many plates to keep spinning at one time."

So among my weaknesses as an employee, I would say my two greatest weaknesses are having high standards and being punctual. You might not immediately think that there's our weaknesses, but they they have been weaknesses for me in the past because I hold myself to high standards. And then those around me those who my co-workers tend to also assume that I'm holding them to a high standard. Word, which isn't necessarily. The case, I'm simply trying to push my own limits and go beyond my personal best, but that can be misinterpreted as trying to make other people look bad, which is really unfortunate. But I'm simply trying to do my best and keep on going beyond that. With punctuality, that I think is a genuine weakness, because I tend to become impatient with those who are not as punctual as I am and who don't show up on time, I tend to live by the motto that if you're not 15 minutes early, you are late. So then I am frustrated with others who show up on time or well on time is acceptable. But if you're 15 minutes late, I'm I'm going to be likely to be a little bit irritated with you. In terms of my greatest strengths, I am extremely creative in the moment and I intuitively understand what needs to happen. And I can make connections between, seemingly, unrelated, topics, and situations, and create Solutions. And it's one of my greatest Joys and so definitely have strength there. I also am very tenacious and I tend to go above and beyond what is required and I seek Like to make my work place the best place it can be for myself and for those around me.

And when I read that, I had to smile because it is true and everything that I do. I try to fill out all of the details and give all of the information that a person could possibly wants possibly to the point of over information. But yes, I'm Excellence.

They largely have been determined by well, to put it quite bluntly student, loon obligations. So having pursued graduate work, and being the first person in my family, to pursue a college degree, I accrued a large amount of debt. And so my first Consideration in making a professional decision about a career was first of all to pay off the loan. And so, in the past, the way that I've typically behaved in such situations is to think about what is going to most benefit me financially, so that I can have a roof over my head and have food to eat close to where all the things that a human needs. So two percent. When in those interests, my first job The out of graduate school was teaching English as a foreign language to Children of wealthy families abroad. I won't go into details about the countries that I specifically worked in. But let's just say the character a personality traits that were most most useful to me and the Situation's were grit and determination because some days I did not want to get up and go to work. My students were most unpleasant and the only thing It kept me going was the knowledge that at the end of this, the student loan would be paid off and I could go have a life. And so in answer to the question, why I think that is why I behaved that way and that situation that was simply that I wanted to be out of debt and be free. Freedom is a high priority for me, the freedom to do what I like in my own time. And so I used my personality traits to achieve Freedom, so grit and determination. Ian, ultimately equaled, more freedom for me."

If it's a workplace, I want to understand why they have those systems in place that they have in place because usually there is a reason and a good reason and then after I understand that, since I also tend to be an innovator by Nature, then I will make suggestions but not usually until So I've been there for at least half a year because I went to thoroughly understand why things have worked at or have not worked in the past and then once I have arrived of that understanding then I am comfortable. Suggesting new ideas. The thing is when you enter a new team people usually are not very receptive to a stranger Waltzing in wanting to change everything. So first you need to win trust and once they trust you and they understand they know that you have good judgment then it is acceptable to what make suggestions and suggest change. But generally people like things the way they are. So and I respect that I respect people, where all their different viewpoints and perspectives of life. And so, because of that respect, I will not immediately insist upon change, unless something is terribly wrong, in which case, I will speak up that if If nothing is terribly wrong, I won't say anything right away. I think the reason that that it is that way is just because of my past experiences and I've worked, I've been in a variety of work environments and I realize that every workplace has its own culture and reasons for doing things. And so I seek to understand before changing"

But usually if the, if the annoying act isn't affecting me then I will I will let it slide. That's partly because of my life experiences. I've learned that there are many things that humans can live through and getting annoyed over every little thing or expressing that annoyance just isn't going to enhance your own quality of life or the quality of life of the person who is annoying you. And I except that they also have a right to quality of life and everybody has little annoying things that they do. I'm certain that I do I've had people People comment before on how my spy smile tends to be a bit crooked. That's just a facial defect. I broke my jaw when I was 16 years old and so, and so I realized that even small things can be annoying to people and I probably have many little ticks that annoy people around me on regular basis and so I went to take that into consideration. So but yeah, recently, I lived with a person in kind of code. Housing environment actually was a I say cohousing it wouldn't be on that. They lived in the same house and they were a night owl while I was not. And they were up all hours of the night and I needed to get up at 5:30 in the morning to work. And in that case, I'd let them know that they are noise. Level was unacceptable the noise extended even to 3 a.m. and Beyond and there wasn't a good resolution. So at that point I simply had to move out Because I could not sleep at night, but so, see ya. So, if the person is not receptive to changing in extreme situations like that, then I will take action and change my own lifestyle so that I don't have to tolerate the annoyance, any longer."

I felt like, I was letting people down, I would say yes, yes, I'll do this for you and then did not follow through because I was disorganized and had I been more organized, I would not have let so many people down. Down and say, yes. I made a conscious decision to not be disorganized anymore and became an organized person and my life has drastically improved from that point on and I am a very organized person. People around me will tell you that. I'm super organized but it's simply because I don't want to let people down or let myself down. I want to live my best life."

I was doing. I feel like this comes from, um, ADHD, maybe my brain is constantly going going, going going going and I feel like I constantly have to be doing something. So I probably don't even think to take the time to pick up my stuff while I'm working. I'm probably just like, okay, I'm done with, you know, this task. What else can I move onto? And I'm another never seems to be picking up my desk. My mom also was not the cleanest person growing up, they were any surface that we had was just covered in.

I won't respond emotionally or negatively when I'm annoyed. I'll need to step away and think about my state, what it was that I cared about that. I felt was disrespected how I can anticipate such feelings.

Let my feelings get the best of me, but if I'm annoyed and morally, I think there's something wrong or someone's being disrespected.

Always cleaning. So I'm very organized. I need to do that or else. I don't feel secure and so when it's not organized is because I'm working so hard. And if I'm working so hard, that's probably not the best situation because hopefully I'm being in a healthy place.

Yes, I want to forge relationships with people and that's an important part of How I work with people. Our work for people is Connecting People. I'm also interested in efficiency and work-life balance, so as a manager that's come in handy, in terms of keeping things focused on the job at hand, doing our best job possible and And also getting in and getting out too. To be done with the work. And Be moving on to our real life which is life outside of work. Not the work isn't important, but more important is family time social time. Time developing yourself as a human being so that you can come back to work and be refreshed and and be a good employee. So that's My Philosophy that I think, helps weakness wise, I think that Some people might view the need for a work-life balance as a weakness in that, in the end. Most of the jobs I've done all the jobs. I've done have not been life and death, so it's a matter of You know, work-life balance life is more important.

I can have a problem with organization sometimes keeping schedules and budgets and that sort of thing like up-to-date in spreadsheets and things like that, but that's something I've improved on in the last few years.

It was a spec thing. Kind of I did get paid a little bit but it was basically, we were given to the I'll guess it's going to help. If I tell you, I work for a television production company, we did nonfiction documentary programming, we had an opportunity to do fiction programming and so I was tasked to write the pilot for this kind of murder-mystery show. and, I was paid a little bit, but they're going to basically present it for free to the television network that we were in hopes that the neverhood. Give us money to produce the pilot. I think I behaved a little self importantly and a little bit. No at all we and was wanting to do my own thing because I felt like I knew better than everybody else in that situation because I had a They're writing background. I had a film degree screenwriting. You know, history of being a screenwriter and knowing a lot about visual storytelling. But there were probably at least a half a dozen Cooks in the kitchen in terms of like how the thing was being written which is never good for a story. And I felt like I should be able to take it in my direction and be like the level of that sort of thing. So I'd say that, you know, it started out with my status being like this is great wood. great opportunity, you're doing a great job and then kind of like plateaued and I want to say that like I bumped a little bit in status, And then probably dipped a little bit instead, as when it was all said and done. Because it, the thing, my attitude didn't help, and I learned a lot from that. Mainly to be more solutions based and more flexible. And also maybe not take on projects that I know are going to be kind of doomed because that I think my status fell because I was also associated with a project that was kind of doomed from the get-go. I kind of intuited that it's easy to say after the fact that I think I thought that that's what was going on. Okay."

You join a new Workforce in their established as a team in your the interloper. So I think I tend to Go out of my way to be accommodating and accepting and again like giving people way more benefit of the doubt, and then pretty soon you figure out. What where the factions are at? All, that sort of stuff, but it may be, I think I purchased very optimistically initially and idealistically and eventually I level off of gotten better about having managing my expectations, but I do think that internet, your team is a is very exciting, but I think I need to have a little bit more of a realistic Outlook when I do that going forward."

Right. So I think when something in somebody's annoying may, I try to get right to the point of why I'm beyond annoyed and see if I can dialogue with them. Respectfully first, about how to fix this particular thing, I've learned to be direct and not overly verbose and to be very plain and clear about my feelings and thoughts So as take get to the heart of the matter and not be passive aggressive, or dance around the issue, I'm trying to think of an example, but I can't right now. So let's say usually this works like Hey, you know so and so you always name your file, unnamed file, maybe we could just start a new Institute like a new nominee culture so that like each file has like a specific name and date stamp. That would be a big help for me and help things run faster on my end. You know, that sort of thing and usually people are fine with that if they If they aren't fine with it. Usually it's they're not like aggressive or mean about it. It's usually they just ignore it and keep doing what they're doing. We just doesn't it gets me annoyed and then you know I'll try to like Institute it from like a like a blanket. Like so if it's one person that's doing this thing now like since my boss on them out and say like can we Institute this new naming system for the files or whatever? So that's that's how I deal with it and it's trying to find B Solutions based."

I'm not going to do something till I have like the exact things in place and it's it's a weird combination of being lazy about certain things. and being being lazy and being a perfectionist, which I think, go Hammond him a lot. It's like perfectionism is excuse to be lazy or something. So It's something I'm working on. And again, I've tried to Institute like, daily practice, as opposed to saving up a bunch of stuff to the last minute, like billing. And Scheduling and stuff like that. Like, when something comes up you put it on the calendar, done time cards, you set aside a half hour a day, to fill them out into the waiting two weeks, and filling out two weeks typos, that sort of thing."

I will approach everyone individually and ensure that I know a little bit about them and that I come off as someone that they can trust and someone that cares about them. I will kind of go out of my way to introduce myself, I because typically I just want to support people support people on my team, especially I consider myself kind of having a servant mentality. When it comes to being it on a team especially if I'm leaving that team, I'm there to make everyone's life easier and also to make them feel cared for and support it. So I would say that. that on a team, I'm the person who will, what I want to be the bone of the team and ensure everyone is taken care of"

If you are someone who I've been dealing with for a long time, it might take on the inside of months, to, to really get on my nerves. But generally in that, Auction. I tend to stay away from that person as much as possible. I'll do a lot of venting about them behind their back and when they're around, I'll pretend to be nice to them. But I'll cringe inwardly because my Med highly sensitive person and things said are tolerable to some people. I can tolerate and so I tend to be very sensitive to those in my environment. Meaning that when someone who really annoys me as around it will like physically bother me and I'll have to like remove myself and sometimes I'm known to like lash out if I get sort of oversaturated with irritation or annoyance."

My desk will probably be covered with different papers and things typically, and also, the place that I work, I have a staff that is better organizing actual material than I am. So, I let them handle that because I'm definitely not. I would consider a organized physically organized person. So,"

Big on collaboration. I think there are a lot of opportunities. When you have good people working together to just come up with new ideas, that one person could never have thought of on their own. And I really enjoy being part of that process and I think I make it easy for other people to be on a team with me too. I don't like arguing. I am very good at finding like the middle ground between things and I'm generally pretty friendly, I think. And one of my weaknesses, I would say if there aren't if there's not like a clear task in front of me, sometimes I will have a hard time figuring out how to get started. I'm something I like to have a list. So, like if it's just me, I can make myself a to-do list and it works out sometimes though, when you have They have had times when their managers like, oh, do something, but it's not very specific and I have a hard time just with not what. It's not clear what I'm supposed to do. I think I struggle a lot because I am very much someone that is like to thank yous the problem. Here's the solution. Let's do it. I don't like the kind of waiting around in the middle part."

Maybe I like to think I'm a nice person, but I'm very enthusiastic and sometimes that like, when it comes to jokes, I like having fun, I like making jokes and then if I get the idea to do something that I think would be fun or funny and some way, I like commit to it very hard. So this is led to situation. Seems like painting my entire face orange for a party. So I could look like a Muppet, or just like going out in the middle of the night to put up missing signs when someone stole a statue from one of our yard today, I just very like committed to the bit committed to making people laugh. I guess this could be committed in general. Yeah, fun, hopefully."

There are few years between now and then. So in the meantime I'm just taking any job or trying to figure out what jobs I can get that will help me get closer to my eventual goals. So there are a lot of students just like, do I want This job that pays me more or do I want this job that actually is more relevant to what I want to do and I usually end up taking the job that's the most relevant to what I want. It does mean that I have a little bit of a hard like I mean money is an issue but but I think it is worth having less money right now because I'm genuinely excited about where I am going and I am just like very passionate and very To this idea of reaching this career goal that I have. And yeah, like I said earlier I am just once I decide to do something, I am fully committed to that. So I have decided I want to work in a library, I'm going to do anything. I can do to get that degree. Get that. Like job experience that I need. So I can actually build a career out of this."

When I first journey teeth this is because I believe that every group or team was like pre-established there's already going to be kind of bliss like not pecking order but just like a way that they do things and I generally don't want to come in if like I don't want to come in disrupt things if they're already working, if I see issues I might Point them out but if the team already works really well together, I don't believe. If it's necessary, my place to change things up. So I'm generally a little bit more reserved until I can get a feel for what's going on, how things work and then once I am, like, firmly like to have a very firm grasp of the Team Dynamics, then I do more comfortable, inserting myself. Like, I feel like I need to get to know people as they are before. Really pushing anything out to them. So, Yeah."

I don't believe there's really any point in causing the fight. If there doesn't need to be one, I don't want to get upset with people. I don't want people to be upset with me. I think it all works. A lot better if everyone is like civil to each other. So generally if it's just like something small and annoying I just Get through it and very adaptable and very good at like I can survive anything. So I'm not that worried if something's just mildly annoying. If it becomes more of a problem I will like will generally try to See like okay who's like directly above the problem? Who's responsible for this see what they can do rather than like a lot of times if you go to the store. So I think you're just fixing the symptom without necessarily fits in the cause so I'd want to go in from above and make sure not only the stops but like what caused this to happen and how can we prevent that?"

In my own personal life, I can be a bit messy but I have a very hard time after you getting work done. If this place is messy. So I generally like to clean up everything will usually do that like in the morning getting my days usually just a little bit more organized in the way of putting things in life and that helps me feel like I actually, like, have space to do my, what I need to do. It's kind of a fresh start and it's just How I like to work. Yeah, so I guess work split workplace not being organized is somewhat typical but not generally for long periods of time. I think you make a mess as you work. If you're doing good work, please be like when I'm actually in the middle of a project, I want to be worrying about things, besides what, like the table looks like, but that's about it."

So I generally think that's one of my greatest strengths as well as I'm also a bit like water, you can put me into any situation. I'm going to mold to that situation whether that be customer service. The physical labor management, whatever needs to be done. I'm just going to try and do my best in that situation. And then you know, this is a bit of a cop-out answer but I would say maybe my weakness is, I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I like everything to be perfect. I try a little too hard on the little things and I can fit kind of obsessed about those little things at times, so it's kind of a strength and a weakness. I wouldn't really call it a direct weakness, but to me, I was as part of my greatest weakness."

So I would say the things he would say about me, is I'm extremely energetic. I can pretty much make friends with anyone. I always like to tell the truth, he's gonna think of me as an honest and a loyal person as well. So I think my friend, my best friend, that being would have tons of good things to say about me.

That affected the amount of money I make is I used to work at Halliburton which was in the oil fields. I made a pretty good amount of money for my age, but just the intensity of the labor and being away from home and things like, that didn't really line up with my interest and what I really wanted to do with my life. So I've decided to take a bit of a pay cut, but a big quality of life Improvement and move into sales. That was really A nice for me, working with people and having just a bit of an interest in what I was doing, comparatively to being in the oilfield, learning about how to help people with sleep, learning about mattresses all those things. Just really interested in me and I felt like I was just enjoying my life at my job a lot more. So that was probably a situation where I made the professional decision. And why I think I did that is just because I just wanted to prove my quality of life. I felt like I would just encourage enjoy myself a little bit more working, a sales job and getting out of the oil fields, nothing against the oil fields and people that do that, it was just better for me.

The one I always go back to. Whenever you say, the word team is always going to be football joining. A new football team, is always a bit much at first, you don't know any of the guys, you don't know what the coaches are going to think anything like that. But I always like to put my best foot forward and I did play quarterback position which ends up being the leader of the team and things like that. So I love to take the initiative and to meet new people. Get my guys to believe in me and just Make us a real team and be be a good quarterback for the guys. And why do I think that is? I don't know. I guess it's just a personality thing. I've always just wanted to lead a team you know of men to the promised land. It's always been my dream. I grew up watching football idolize, Tom Brady, all that stuff. So I always just wanted to do it just like them."

Well, I think all humans deal with that here and there, you know, on the same way, I get annoyed by people at times. Typically, if someone is annoying me, I'm just going to remove myself from the situation or just try to ignore them. It's not really worth hurting their feelings or causing drama or anything like that. I'm usually just kind of remove myself from the situation or if I can't remove myself, I'll just do my best to ignore them because it's really not that big a deal. As long as they're not antagonizing me or patronizing me or anything crazy like that, I don't think it's usually that big a deal. The reason that think that is, I think I just may be was raised that way. You know. I had a lot of siblings and things like that so I'm pretty good at dealing with conflicting personalities and just kind of at the end of the day, you're going to save yourself a lot of stress, if you just move on and avoid the situation or just kind of ignore it, Thank you."

I kind of do well, in the chaos, if it's organized perfectly, that's great, that's perfect. If it's not, that's not really the biggest deal for me either. I tend to have a bit of a photographic memory to a degree. I guess you could say, I always kind of remember where things are, even if they're out of place. It's really not that big a deal. So I can always kind of work in that chaos like a we back in sales, a lot of things are disorganized. It starts to get really busy, there's to get really crazy and you kind of just got to do your best to work and navigate through the chaos. Um, why do I think that is probably just has to go back to like I said growing up in a small home with a lot of siblings and a lot of people in that home people's things, just kind of get put Wherever not, everyone always has a space to put something. So you kind of just learn to work around and kind of work with what you got and you kind of remember where things tend to be."

Serious on my plate. I believe that this drink because it keeps me focused to keeps me adaptable, the time management constraints. It also keeps me open to a lot of new resources in the event. I get stuck or I get met with a conflict in the middle of the project. There are some weaknesses that do come along. That teamwork, I take a little bit longer to warm up to a team than normal. That's usually overcome by basically treating teamwork, is a process flow and usually isn't doing packable. And my job. Another weakness that I try to roll into his strength is when I get really focused on something. I try to also find the people who are around that are also really interested in that and Make connections there and those lead me to more connections and slowly learning my team and becoming a bigger and more integrated part of it."

I try to take things slow and step-by-step when We're on an escalation like that and it's mostly due to my previous training as well as what has worked for me.

That requires me to like, go grab stuff and work somewhere else. I'm usually pretty, on top of like having things stacked, or they should be folders lined up like they should email checked or archived or stored for later. It's not very typical for that to be like what happens at my workspace, but when things get really going, it can get kind of chaotic down there. The reason I think it is is because I might leave little bookmarks for myself in places like this is a mess right now but I needed this and like this part of its missing. So it's kind of like a little sand timer or something and doesn't typically bother me a lot. It just I guess it's kind of like a nagging thing in the background.

I am going to behave in the best way that I know how are we going to rely on my training and knowledge? And what I have been taught at this facility job and that is going to sway how I behave in the situation and the only reason that is is because I want to make sure that I'm not doing something that is inappropriate or, you know, I'm not allowed to do.

I have no problem. speaking online or, you know, giving somebody my opinion if it's asked for but Yeah. Usually like I'm able to interact work with people.

I feel that my greatest strengths as an employee primarily one of them is that they take ownership in the tasks and projects that are assigned to me.

My ability to complete my portion of the task. I care about the results. I motivate others to also help me complete the task and explain the value of it. I just think it's important to have drivers and not passengers. Probably one of my weaknesses as an employee is that I am a bit of a perfectionist. I often struggle between creating perfect work product or very near perfect work product and And also meeting a deadline. You know, I struggle with accepting that something is good enough to serve the necessary purpose and that sometimes you just need to turn things into keep things on schedule. I'm working on this weakness by, you know, delegating more and also by really understanding the need for Perfection on certain projects.

I have a legal background, a lot of these deals are sales deals that I am able to receive some type of commission if the deals get closed. However, you know, I take legal risk for our company and read terms of any deal. So I have struggled with accepting a deal that is not legally great for my company, but that would result in a closed deal end Commission in my favor, which affects my personal finances. So, You know, as a lawyer, I've had to remind myself that I have an obligation to my company and that the risk is the number one priority for the company and not a closed deal that could, you know, pad my wallet a bit more with commission. So I've had when I feel that this is the case, I've brought in a neutral third party or just glows my feelings towards a partner so that I wasn't unilaterally make. Making any decisions that. Were Jaded by my own. You know, desire for financial gain. I think it's just a line, you have to tow and once you are immoral, once it's a slippery slope.

So, I really sit back and Watch until I feel like I have a good grasp of the team Dynamic and also until I understand how the team interacts with other departments and kind of their needs and how they are received on a company-wide basis.

So when something is unorganized it just it doesn't, it gives me makes me tense and it makes me feel the pressure of the situation. It also makes me frustrated with the people that might have caused it. If they weren't under constraints, that led up to it, they were just being lazy or dirty and I think that's just because the work I do requires a lot of focus. Yes.

And I have a limited amount of space here. Here in my apartment.

I'm trying to think just in all fairness about, like, What is like a potential - I can be somewhat anxious and somewhat schedule oriented.

I would say, usually, in such situations, I behave with more of my emotional well-being. Best interest in mind and that can include, you know, prioritizing the amount of money I'm making. But I think it often depends on how how I'm doing financially and how? How severe the potential decision that I make would impact those finances. So for example, if I am at risk of losing housing or losing my ability to comfortably afford, the foods that I enjoy eating each month, that would definitely be a situation where I would accept more of what I would consider like - emotional circumstances in order to, you know, stay on top of those more basic levels of Finance, I think honestly, that's, it's just a practical trade-off, you know, if I'm choosing between more frivolous, Were more frivolous expenses?

So often times I will try to get to know people People will try to get to know what the protocol, or the, the way that things are comfortably done in the team is, and I think that is just a matter of deferring to people that have been in that situation longer than I have. And also from a, you know, from a positive social standpoint, I think it's good to try to get to know No, the people that you're going to work with, you know, just keeping it professional and I think there's keeping it like a little bit dry and uninteresting and I think you want to keep it professional but you don't want to do that while sacrificing any sort of actual human connection that you can have with your coworkers."

So, So, I often lasted the situation is really. Something like more severe than just being annoyed. I usually take the if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all approach. And again I think that is that's just because I I tend to not like to make people feel bad or negative themselves like I consider myself a pretty empathetic person. A lot of the time. And so it makes me feel uncomfortable to make other people feel uncomfortable. If I have to deal with being a little bit annoyed, so that I don't make someone else feel bad about themselves.

My family were from a more rural rural part of our state and we made the decision to relocate for Better professional opportunities as well as. You know, graduate school opportunities. So and when going into that decision, what I initially looked at I looked at the long-term effects, not just in the short term whether you know I'd be happy. You know you know what, I be able to do short term immediate things, I looked at the longer term, the term issues, such as school for any children that we might have job prospects what the housing market would look like?

I don't think that anything positive is going to come for me, getting upset losing my temper or anything or trying to be Petty. I just try to let it to let it have no effect on me or at least. No obvious effect on me because typically, a my experiences when someone has been trying to ignore me when I'm sorry, I annoy me. When someone has been trying to annoy me, if I just don't play into it, if I just act like I'm not bothered, then I noticed that most likely you know their behavior it changes they realize they're not getting a reaction out of me.

It where they were at and how what sort of qualities I might have that, I can not just reinforce but also bolster up my worst sort of behaviors in order to actually achieve that goal. I think that I do these because I do my best to be meticulous. I try to reflect the people who are also successful. I feel like since they are already there, it's good to represent like follow their path and try. And recreate what they did or did get the same sort of outcome for myself."

I've both switched Apartments as well as careers in my life. When I behave, I try to be friendly outgoing as possible and really learn to listen to what my coworkers are like what they're talking about and also, how they interact with each other. It's understand, it's important to understand group dynamics and attempt to slide into that. So, you don't cause any sort of massive disruption, I think that it's a good idea to do. Ooh, so I think that generally, I want to be a person who's likeable from a team who wants to be dependable and who wants to keep my job? Nobody wants to be the person that stands out and creates problems especially from a new team where there's already a certain set of behaviors and responsibilities."

I think typically people are annoying because they have some sort of personal issue that they either don't recognize or they don't fully want to change about themselves at first. If it's something small, I'll tend to let it go. And I think, okay. Hey, maybe this is just one time but if it's a constant problem to I'll have to address it with them. There's no reason to just deal with somebody doing knowing Behavior to them when you can try and talk with them about it. I think that this is generally just because it's a good way to handle things, everybody has some sort of annoying Behavior. They do something that upset someone else, nobody is perfect. And in order for us to get along, we need to be able to communicate with one another."

I keep my everything organized in my drawers. I don't think that people who are, I think I should say, I think the people who aren't organized, aren't giving enough credit to the actual career, just feels like they don't actually care about the workplace there in keeping a clean house is important and it shows how professional you are. It's not something that even requires too much effort. Effort because in the long run, it's going to help you as you know, exactly where everything is. There's no reason to be messy. And I think that I think that it's just generally reflects poor on you as a person and willed, and it creates problems in the long run. If you don't keep yourself organized, if you don't know where things are, and someone comes looking for something, it's going to take you more time, to find it, if you can even find it at all."

I'm somebody who doesn't take no for an answer and when the going gets tough, you know, I tend to get going, you know, I grant learned a lot of lessons about power of hard work and perseverance and so I'm not one to back down from a fight and some and it's a strength of German. Well, throughout my whole life, as for weakness, I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist and I can hold me back at times, you know, I I like to get involved in a lot of little details of my work and that can also cause me to get wrapped up in things that don't matter. And so as I've tried to begin to progress in my career Advanced, you know I it's got to get out of the detail and be more focused on you know the Strategic work that really matters in terms of setting the course for the direction of my cup of the company that I'm working at."

I'm not saying it's going to mess around in those situations and I did something it's because I matters a lot to me, and so I want to be able to look back when it's all said and done and know that I don't have any regrets, right? A lot of people they could be Rest the nervous and act in a manner in which they don't typically do. And for me, you know, I think that generally I am somebody that's just not that way. I try to act business as normal and just get done, get what needs to be. Done done. And so that's typically the way I would behave in that."

That's a big behavioral thing for me, that I really focus on because I want to come in. I don't want to rock the boat and give people a poor impression of me early on. Never it's a cliched saying we never get a second chance to make a first impression. So I'd rather come in and be something that's more observant in nature than some of its going to come in and Rock the Boat. Boat. And I think that's just because I want to make sure that I get off on the right foot with people. So they are more willing to engage with me down the road where I would need them in the scope of my work. And so that's just the way I would typically behave in this situation."

I can tend to have, you know, I'm not somebody I value my time. Highly, I don't like to have my time wasted at the end of the day and so I can get annoyed when I feel like somebody's wasting my time and costing me from a productivity perspective, both inside of the office and outside, I think that's a big reason why I may react this way and some situations I'm trying to be more compassionate, more. More understanding with folks, and not be short and shut down a conversation when I make it a little bit annoyed with somebody. So that's typically the way I would react and situation that some of these annoying me,"

I think back when I was working in the office my desk will get messy, it typically would happen near the end of a fiscal year where I was very very busy with trying to go through financial planning for the teams that I supported. So it typically has a lot to do with what my calendar looks like at the end of the day and how many deliverables that I have going on? It's not very typical me. I'm somebody that likes to be organized. So I don't come back and be stressed out about Out how things, look how I feel. But but inevitably in a busier season, those kind of things don't take quite as high priority for me and so things can slide and my workspace may not be very organized."

Best thing to do is just walk away, get away from the situation. Not try to agitate things, you no more. So I think staying calm is important especially in a environment where you're in a company or something like that. The last thing you want to do is put a bed stain on the company for some you did."

I get done what I need to get done. I keep track of with the metrics are and also I often keep track of the metrics of the people around me so that way we're all able to be complete and on the same task at the same time, I would say that my weakness is far as that goes up because I'm so motivated and goal-oriented sometimes I will exceed what my mandate is or maybe even be too helpful to the other people who are around me. So that way they might feel a little bit pressured and that's entirely accidental but it does happen and I can be a bit demotivated when work is not very well directed and poorly organized."

See what she really means is that whenever she has a question needs to look something up, or needs to keep track of the rules for a game, or what have you should can ask me. And I usually have it memorized. I can tell her where I found it out, and why I've made any decisions about the details that I may have made and lay it out. So that way, she can have a clear understanding what's going on while Often do random trivia questions. So on so forth and We really get along very well that way because she feels as though she can, trust me to have a clear understanding of what needs to be done at any given moment."

And I was working on a platform that had a paper task metric, the more that you the more you turned in the more you get paid regardless of quality so long as it met minimum standards and so forth. And I made the decision that I would prefer to have solid quality work. Work that took me a bit longer over making more money because I could have actually made quite a bit of money money working on this platform. And instead, I did a cave myself to making sure that the customers got the best quote possible, at product, in a reasonable time, frame for the money that they were spending. If I believe that I did this because I believe in what I do, and I prefer that my work speak for, what am I am capable of, and what I believe in, rather than what, we'll be able to make me the biggest fuck. I would prefer to make sure my employer makes the amount of money they should make and get to the work that they deserve rather than focusing on myself. And that translates even two independent gig work where I only ever work for this person once."

I'm always kind of evaluating what's going on, figuring out what the culture is, and how I want to react to other people. I get along well in teams and work well with other people, but I'm not exactly a gregarious people person. I'm not usually at the very front of the chain making decisions. I you tend to end up in more of an advising role people ask me questions about Out how something works and what the rules are and then work based off of the analysis that I give I like being in that place where I can be helpful to everyone in support the team rather than trying to enforce my own will upon it. And I intend to enjoy the situation quite a bit."

I've been annoying that it can be difficult to keep track. I mean that's true of everyone. I think my son annoys me frequently in order to talk about random pieces of music, he found on the internet or videos. He wants to mess with or because he wants to make bird calls you know and my usual reaction to being in the Annoyed is to take a deep breath. Listen to what's going on to see if there's something. I actually need to react to. And to be honest, if they aren't saying something that's of meaning to me, I'll usually say that I'm engaged to something else and go back to what I'm doing. I have a high capacity for annoyance that isn't directly related to my current task when someone's interfering with my tasks. I generally look gently but firmly tell them that they're interfering with my tasks and ask them to back away or do something specific. Whatever is the ignored to get my work done? I don't put up with interruptions in my work but I can put up with annoyances. Occasionally, I'll get your Anibal and BRAC more strongly than I intended, but that's not very common."

You see my work, my electronic work, all my documents and sub documents and folders, and so forth, very neatly organized and or everything is, I make sure that I keep everything please, excuse me, it placed in a way that I can find anything. I can possibly need to get to my boss from lhasa years and just pull it out, hand it over Computers allow for extreme levels of organization, there's no excuse anymore. My workspace on the other hand, tends to be a little bit cluttered, I'll have Post-it notes and documents that your documents here. So, two sitting over here that I'm currently working on. If I'm at home, I have some stuffed animals like the back of my desk and said that a chaotic space and I work better in a chaotic workspace with organized work. And I think that's because I'm tend to be Very focused on the end result but my process is not always the cleanest process now that I let my desk actually get dirty like you that would bother me to no one."

I'm very determined, like, if I really want something, I go for it and nothing can hold me back from that. I really strongly desire the position. So I will do anything. It takes to properly train for it and learn about it and just do the best I can to succeed in in my industry. I guess they would say some of the The weaknesses would be, I do have a little bit hard time, working around big crowds of people. I have a little bit of social anxiety, but I think it's nothing that I could not like overcome because, in my past, I've worked, and I always overcame that social anxiety, so that would definitely be one weakness. But I think a definitely a strength would be that I'm able to overcome that the less that I kind of isolate myself, the better it gets. And if I'm really determined and I really want the job, I will definitely overcome that. No problem. I think that I work well in teams with other people. I definitely think that, you know, I can be a positive asset to a company, I can do the best that I can to put forth what I'm able. So, that's definitely a good strength for me. Another weakness might be that I sometimes, I tend to overthink things I guess you could say, if I'm in a situation where I need to get this done on time, sometimes I might kind of psych myself out and overthink it and just think too hard about it instead of just kind of dive in and get it done. But I definitely think that I I have more strength than weaknesses."

I'm not a genius or anything but I definitely try. I would say he describes me as loyal. I stay true to what I stand for and I take pride in making sure that people like care about feel loved and cared for and I will always be committed to them.

I definitely want to think that situation through the best that I can. One thing I like to do, which I don't know if it's like weird or not but I definitely like to sit down and kind of analyze the situation like right the pros and the cons of something and kind of way the The risks and the benefits. Before I make a final decision, I try not to obsess too much on, you know, something to wear. I'm overthinking it. And I definitely have a tendency to do that as I said before. But I definitely try to definitely make the best decision based on the risks and the benefits. And what I really think that I should do it, definitely is a big decision.

I'm entering a new team of people that I don't even know. So I want to introduce myself. I want to make sure that they get a little bit of a feel for who I am, what I do, what I can help, bring to the team. I think I'd behave this way, because I know if I was part of a team of people and there's somebody coming in that was new, I would want to know who are they, what are their intentions? You know, are they going to be an asset to this? Are they going to be somebody that we don't want? You definitely want to make it known that. You the kind of person you are introduce yourself. Tell everybody a little bit about yourself so that they can trust you a little bit. It's really hard to trust. People that you don't know. So going into a team of a new team of people, you know they may all have similar goals and attributes and maybe they don't know about you because they're just meeting you. So I definitely think I would want to make sure that they know who I am, what I'm about, what I can, I guess incorporate, so to speak to the team. And I would want to feel part of the team. So in order to do that, That I have to kind of introduce myself and tell them what I'm about and make sure they don't feel like threatened or anything. I want to just fit in as part of the team and not stand out from the team. So I definitely would Behave in a manner, that's appropriate. Professional.

It's especially hard when you're really annoyed at somebody and you want to say something, but I think in a professional sense, it's better to just ignore them and try to move on with your day, you know, and hope that the next interaction you have with that person may be a better one. I think that it's, it's common, you know, I've I worked at plenty of of Industries where you have that one employee or co-worker that likes to annoy you just to kind of get a rise out of you. I've had some actually pretty bad experiences to be honest with coworkers so I've learned from that that when I'm in the workplace on there to be professional and get a job done. So I'm not trying to have any kind of drama or any kind of Interactions with my co-workers. So, I definitely react in a way of just, maybe laughing it off or just quickly trying to brush it off. And I think I just react that way because I feel it's better to avoid the drama then to start anything. So I just think that, you know, in time, you kind of get used to people and that's great. But there's still always going to be that one person that annoys you and you just have To like realize it's not really worth getting a rise out of you. It's not really worth wasting your time when you're at work, you're at work and you should professionally be doing things. So if the annoyance continues on and it's like out of control and I cannot handle it, I guess I would talk to my supervisor about it."

If things are not in perfect order looking professional. So typical of me. Definitely not if my workspace is unorganized. It's probably because I'm rushing around and get some work done or, you know, I didn't have time to clean it that day. So I would just probably finish up my work and then get it cleaned up as soon as possible it would definitely be very aggravating so I would want to get it done and cleaned up. So definitely not typical of me. I'm a very organized person. I just that's it's part of my Stein. It's just who I am. It's how I am at home at work. Anywhere. I am, I like to be organized. I mean, if I walk into somebody's house and I see they have a sink full of dishes. I will do that. That's just how I As a person. So I don't know why I'm like that. I think I just over all the years of kind of being raised in a very organized manner or I guess so to speak. I was the one who had all the chores. So I just grew up knowing that, in my opinion, cleanliness is next to Holiness and I don't feel right and my brain, if everything's not completely organized. And set in stone. I just don't feel right if it's not. So I would say it's definitely not typical of me. But if it happens I would clean it up as soon as possible to make it look nice, it just makes me think better and makes my brain sharper and it makes me fully prepared for anything that comes my way."

Creativity is Maybe less practical in some instances but in Creative environments such as on writing projects or even drafting emails. I generally do a pretty good job at that and then attitude wise, I am a pretty easy to work with person. I'm very diplomatic, which usually creates good relationship, strong relationships and makes me a reliable partner to work. Work with an environments. My biggest weakness, the flip side of the coin there is probably my my confidence.

I think they would also describe me as I describe myself as a creative. And I think they would also agree that sometimes I lack confidence in certain scenarios, but and my best friend goes back to when I was like pre-kindergarten, so he knows me very well. So, you know, Has the good and the bad but I think he would definitely describe me as Dependable. I think he would describe me as a good friend. Someone who's a good listener?

When there is a vacuum, I am just always willing and capable of doing that which has often in group settings. Led to me becoming the leader of a group of people, but if there's anyone else who is willing to take that position, they will and I won't Vie for that or anything. Professional decision. So when making like, professional decisions about my career, I usually do not put myself out there, I usually fill vacuums or voids, which is good and bad. There are pros and cons to that, I think."

But I will encourage myself to introduce myself to people in a friendly way. But I can imagine that I might actually seem kind of standoffish at first when meeting a group of people. If everybody doesn't know each other for all on the same page, don't know each other. I think I'm more likely to put myself out there. Whereas if I'm joining a group of people who already know each other, I probably will be more standoffish. I'll be very friendly and diplomatic and Cooperative, but I might not be as I might not insert myself into conversations that are happening. Organically already is what I would say. And that might just be a social anxiety thing, a shyness thing. However, you look at it"

So I'm respectful. But if there is, if something has bothered me I try and be honest about that, I don't try and withhold that information because I find that leads to resentment that grows. So I like I like transparency and Clarity and I also like to bring up things. Such as annoyance in a productive healthy way, that's not toxic or not critical in the wrong way. That is That it acknowledges their point of view. My point of view and leads to a positive outcome, if that makes sense."

I am a neat person, but I do let things build up to a point of disorganization before then kind of hyper focusing on cleaning it until it's clean. And then letting that process repeat on a cycle which I feel is normal and perhaps healthy. I wouldn't say I don't think I'm messy. And I don't think I am a neat freak so probably I'm average because I very much like having a clean work environment and it just depends on the time and efficiency of making that happen because it's I feel like you waste time. If you clean, if you spend so much time, keeping the space clean, you're not working. That's no longer helpful to anyone. So I try and find a healthy balance in between"

Number one, would be work ethic, so I have a tremendous work ethic I get from my father. I don't like to miss work at all. I like to work hard when I'm at work. Another would be communication. I am excellent Communicator. I'm a supervisor of 12 people. And my biggest thing is, I want them to communicate with me and vice versa about any issues or problems. If I have to say a weakness, it would be trying to take on everything for myself instead of Handing off or delegating to somebody else because that would free up more time for me to do things. I need to get done and it's always no of my other employees. So that would say be my greatest strengths and weaknesses."

If sorry, if engineering can change something on the aircraft or not, I said only changed review board and we decide that. So most days, I make big decisions, but there are once in awhile decisions that you're talking about, you know, millions of dollars and if you don't get the correct professional decision, You definitely won't move up. Hopefully, you won't be demoted. So I behave in the situations with extra attention to detail. Specially and discuss exactly what is needed for engineering to make a change. And so most important thing is the company we don't end up scrapping. Any parts we get the reason is that because the more money obviously,You will take that one. Yeah, I think I'll take everything seriously but you'll give it a little extra attention because you're talking millions of dollars and if you scrap millions of dollars because you made an error that could get, you demoted, I've seen it.

And I ask more questions and normal because obviously it's your new people and there's new situations and everything. You deal with is going to be different and new for myself. So that's why I asked all the questions and treat everybody with respect because you're connected co-workers. And then you do treat with respect, you need to treat people that way to get back respect I think so you work hard Drew people with respect and you'll get that back but that's how I ever got back to it and why"

But at that time, I was actually the best when I scheduled a production facility, I was actually the best one of our group doing it, so, The wrong reaction. But I got frustrated with her and said, that's not going to happen, go sit down and maybe mind your own business. I'm the best one. We have at scheduling Why did that? I was a little younger and this person was extremely pushy. Ignore it. The pushy and annoyed everybody, the better way to handle it would be probably your to go. There was a guy in my arm and to really kind of, you know what everybody, but I would just not really, but anything you said get under my skin, you know, it's did work, I haven't talked to him. Yeah, we'll talk back and forth a lot of banter, but you know, the one thing, I didn't let him see emotionally, they annoyed me, or feel that way, because that's just going to take away from my work and what I'm trying to accomplish. So I do not let him get under my skin or my head, so I can produce the way I need to have time to worry about him. So that is how I reacted one row bad. And the next one good. So I did Lisa learned."

So, that is the typical thing that I like, is organization. I'm very big on having things. Organized helps you tremendously was probably one time. I can think of that, I didn't. Have the organization. However, under a big project with the finish, and I had laid everything out of my desk, and, and boxes everywhere. And I don't like, I mean, I obviously don't like that because I want to be organized, but, you know, why that happened was because we had a deadline to get to. I couldn't worry about putting everything back exactly where I went, I had to do that after the project. That's the only times that my workspace would be. Sizes, if a big project comes and they had really no time to soar servicing and put it back exactly where it goes.

I honestly, normally behave with a little bit of anxiety because it is a lot. not on your shoulders, but I usually make it through because I trust my instincts and I know that I have the right intentions and good in my heart. So hopefully that is the output that I'll get as well. Why do I think that is because I might parade around as a pessimist, but I actually am an eternal optimist and I believe that you put good in.

But it does happen in these situations, I'm usually very polite because, like I said earlier, I am pretty non-confrontational and sometimes someone didn't win you. It is not personal so it's not. Not their fault that that particular behavior is annoying to me. However, so life is life.

At the same time, I got offered a job from another department that it had hunted me to become an analyst for our different sailings.

But when they do, I tend to be the person who doesn't focus on the negative and due to me being like that, it allows me to not let someone get to me. So so typically when I am around someone who annoys me, I try to put myself in their shoes and realize that sometimes what someone is projecting isn't about me, it's about them how they're feeling, and it maybe it's just their personality and I do that because I think I'm generally so optimistic and positive that I feel like If I deflect and not allow them to change my mood based on their mood, it won't become something that I internalized and people will pick up on that and probably not feed into that annoying Behavior."

I tend to be that type of person that just wants to jump on everything, get it all done at the same time. So how typical is it of me? It happens, I would say for one quarter of the day and try to stop myself and trying to get everything done, it mediately generally, I like to try to focus on the most important things and I try to put something Is on the back burner. So I create folders for myself, I try to be very organized in order to not to get my my workspace to be unorganized, but it happens only because of the nature of my job and how the function of my job that I deal with so many people and sometimes at the same time because I have five to six phone calls coming in that I'm juggling at the same time, so I try not. Not to be like that. And typically I try to be more organized but due to being the type of person that likes to get everything done at the same time, it's something that I have to be conscious of and reel in."

I have an opportunity to learn something new. I'm always really excited in positive about the new experience along with that.

I really enjoy sitting down with people and that moment when they really figure out what what is happening when it clicks, you know, I really enjoy seeing that and helping other people, learn weaknesses.

I think that my My best friend would describe me as being a good listener and a pretty compassionate person. You know, I tend to really absorb other people's emotions and I'm good at reading people.

And if we make the wrong decision in that situation, people could die. So usually in those types of situations, I am very calm, you know, able to really Process things. And you know, keep myself focused, but At times after the fact, is when I get nervous when I'm kind of thinking about the things that we did, that's when the nerves sort of set in. But in the moment, I am always able to focus and put aside the nerves. I think that the reason that I'm like, that is, you know, I'm more of a doer, you know, I try to avoid thinking too much about the consequences while the You know the issue is taking place because it's just not helpful at that time to really let yourself get caught up in the emotions."

I spent several years as a travel nurse and that involved, you know, every 13 weeks I was basically moving to a different facility with completely different employees. So you know after having that many experiences with it it sort of became a routine for me when I'm entering a new team. I try to make it a point to introduce Myself to everybody and you know, offer help, you know, I always want to make sure that they know that I'm somebody who can be depended on. So I really make an effort to get to know everybody a little bit that way I can sort of, you know, Gage, everybody strengths and weaknesses. You know, find the people that can help me with things when I'm struggling. But also find the people that may be struggling with something that I can help them with. With, I think that the reason that I'm like, that is because while I am a very strong nurse, I do understand that everybody needs help with things sometimes and including myself, and, you know, being able to rely on your co-workers and being able to trust them is a very important part of working as a leader, and, and working as an employee as well."

The best thing to do in that kind of situation for me, is, you know, to just try to focus on getting the job done. First of all. And, you know, also may be trying to understand why somebody may be behaving that way. I think. Most of the time, if you can get to the root of the, you know, of the behavior, you can try to, you know, mitigate After the fact, you know, to try to prevent those kinds of situations from happening in the future. You know, a good example of that is, you know, in healthcare sometimes patient, assignments are challenging and just sort of keeping an eye out for my team, strengths and weaknesses and you know, trying to focus on not giving somebody too much. You know, that helps everybody have a better experience and then they tend to behave in ways that are less challenging."

There are a lot of things that are out of our control. So having an organized workspace, which if, if I'm working as a nurse with patients and organize workspace for me, looks like, you know, stocking my med card, making sure that I have you know everything that I need syringes needles you know alcohol swabs that really helps make the day go better. Really not typical of me to start the day out without everything that I need just because I have been in the past in situations where I wasn't prepared where I didn't have the things that I need and it puts you further and further behind I absolutely hate feeling. Like, I'm behind I hate having to go in and out of a room, you know, to gather supplies. Once I'm there, I hate wasting time. So not super typical of me to not have the things. You know, that I need at the beginning of a shift. But as I said, sometimes things happen and you know, the situation gets kind of off the rails and you just have to do your best to Take it as it comes."

When I'm assigned a task, I take the time to really understand it. Develop a plan on how I'm going to approach it outline my plan. Consider what resources I'm going to need consider who I might need to help me and then outline the steps. And then I Implement my plan. I'm very methodical and I always evaluate the results of my plan to see how successful I was identify any weaknesses and then move forward evaluate the results and then determine if how in what I need to improve in the future. So I'm always reliable and consistent and how I approach things, I would say, some of my weaknesses can be that I can tend to be a little bit emotional. I can take things a little bit personally. So that can kind of hinder me if I'm a little bit reactive and I need to temper that in order to make sure that I don't react to impulsively and they can be a good thing as well. And that it keeps me motivated and keeps me very invested in my work, but I need to make sure that stays tailored and focus that I can use it in a positive way."

If somebody else is unprepared, I'm the one that's going to be. Picking up the slack, have all everything accounted for be. The one that's going to have extra Band-Aids, extra clothes extra food.

We would be the right service provider for them that we can really add value to their businesses that the services that we could provide really, really detail-oriented to their business that we have solutions to provide to them that they could not get somewhere else that the level of attentiveness that we could provide were really much higher than what anyone else could provide. So there were decisions that I had to make that showed that the value that I could provide in addition to my team were invaluable. So it was hard work, it perfect. Included communication, and included, attention to detail, and it included putting this all together in a way that was understandable to the client. So it's really a matter of showing the client that I could understand what they needed. I could deliver what they needed and that their needs were the most important thing. And that relationship is really the most important thing in the bottom line goes beyond anything else. And that that relationship is really the foundation.

And the most important thing to me is learning the dynamic of the new team learning what's important to the new team learning how the new team comes together to work and how they function as a group separately individually. And as a whole unit, the most recent time that this kind of happened to me, Was about three years ago I came together and it was probably the biggest team that I've worked on a team of 30 to 40 people and it took a good amount of time to learn the Dynamics. And there were a few times when I stumbled slightly, but the times you stumble of the times, you learn the most and you come back from that and you learn a lot regarding the team. And I think that's the most important time to reach out to the individuals. Learn what that About the team Dynamic. And you can kind of say, Hey, you know, this is what I learned from that, not even a mistake from that experience and I want to learn from that, how we can increase communication, how we can increase the ways, we work more mature and the efficiency, and how we work together and create a new process or procedure. And really, it was a huge team. We became a A very well greased wheel over time and how we function to be nearly Flawless and it was a great experience, it was very hard but the harder it was. I think the more successful we became over time and we became a very well-managed team and I learned so much from that experience to apply that whole process anytime I integrated into a new team."

And I think the important thing to always remember is that no one's going to work, just like you do. No one's going to provide a work product, just the way you like. And I think, for me, in particular, what I've learned over time is that people definitely do. Our can annoy me. And but what I always tend to realize when I feel it happening is it's usually about me and my state of mind and perhaps I'm letting work get to me and I'm not taking enough time to relax or reassess how work is for me. So kind of, you know, examples can be, excuse me, a subordinate. Submit something to me and there's some kind of careless mistakes and I feel myself getting a little irritated and I without kind of thinking about it, I let the emotion get to me, but if I take a little bit longer to think about it, I realize it's not about the mistake, it's not about the subordinate everybody makes mistakes including me. I make careless mistakes everybody does. And I realized My job, of course, is to review Point them out. That's what I'm here for. And that is totally normal, but I realized more, it's about me, not taking enough time out and to control my emotions. So, I like it, when I feel myself getting annoyed, because it's a check for me to check myself in my emotions, it's not about the situation. So it's always a good lesson to remember where I am into into. Understand my role and to know that this is exactly what's supposed to happen. It's expected and to take that feeling and turn it Inward. And remember my duty and my job."

So because of that, they sit at my desk. So it's more like There's a lot of there are a lot of materials and files at my desk. It's not messy. But there's a lot of stuff there just because there's no other place for these files to go and I can't get rid of them because of certain rules that don't allow me to. So unfortunately policies in place require that certain documentation is held for certain amount of time. If we're up to me, I would be getting rid of these files in this documentation and it would be completely paperless and I wouldn't have a lot of stuff, but there are certain procedures that I have to follow which requires that I keep a lot of stuff, so Organized messy tidy. I mean there's different kind of ways to say that I think in general I know where to find things when I need them. It's not necessarily disorganized. But there's a lot of stuff that I have to maintain just because of policies that are in place. Again, if it were up to me, I wouldn't keep any paperwork. I would prefer everything to be virtual, but for legal purposes. I have to keep some some things in Paper format. So somewhat disorganized because of certain legal procedures that I have to follow and we don't prefer it to be that way, I prefer to keep everything paperless completely because that's a lot easier. Keeping things and papers not is not preferable."

What is the person who's trying to solve the problem? What do they really need or want? So I'll ask a lot of questions of them. Try to figure out. Those Minor Details that they themselves, may not have known. And then once I have some of those, a good understanding of what's trying to be solved, try to break it down into pieces that are manageable and different members of the team can pick up and solve together or independently. So I think that is one one great strength. I have as a weakness. Sometimes, you know, maybe I over Schedule myself, it's hard on a remote team. Like how I'm working now to ensure that there's enough FaceTime. It's all virtual but I think maintaining that communication with the team is really important and it can be hard sometimes when you're working remotely. So one of my goals is to continue being a better manager and getting a closer relationship with each of the people on my team."

Those kind of things. I have never had anyone say that. I Have annoyed? Yeah, I do annoy people, I'm sure, but it's not something that comes up a lot where people seem to not like, to be around me. I'm not very extroverted. I would say more introverted, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy being around other people. So I'm still very personable and friendly. Probably another thing. My co-workers may say is that I don't get to I don't show stress do easily, maybe I do get stressed but I don't show that and I think like having that calm demeanor is really helpful for a team lead. Like I am So that's something that I think someone both a best friend would describe me. And then a co-worker would describe."

Sounds like it's a very important decision. Of course, I'm going to be very thoughtful and just take the time to consider, am I making the right decision? Does it affect other members of the team in a positive or negative way? But just being very considerate of my team and the impact on our project, And then finally, like, how does it impact me? And I I would say I'm not very impulsive, so I'm going to make sure the right decision is made. I have good information sources to make the right decision and if I need help, I'll seek out help. I'll talk to members of my team, I will talk to my project lead or other people that have worked with. If it involves something that could affect my, the way I work, or where I need to live, something that may affect my family. I'll speak to my wife about that. and I wouldn't expect it would be something that I decision needs to be made within an hour or they even so hopefully there's enough there would be time to make a proper decision."

It excites me because of all the possibilities that are right at your right in front of you as you join a new team. Usually I wanted to spend time listening and learning how the team functions, how they communicate, how they operate just so that I can. Not really ruffle any feathers so to speak. I want to be able to come on to a team and have them respect me and know that I'm gonna do what's best for them. Now, in terms of helping the team, I'm going to listen, of course and find ways that maybe things aren't working well for that team. And maybe there's ways that can do things differently. And eventually I'll keep track of those and share with the team. Hey, this is how these are things that we could maybe do better."

Maybe cause that person to act that certain way. Why do I find that person annoying? Maybe there's something that I'm doing or something that I can do differently. Of course, there could just be jerks out there and maybe the best approach to dealing with that is just to avoid, or minimize interactions with them. If it's affecting other people, I would hopefully see that I would step up and say something to stop any Behavior that's inappropriate. But generally I like to think I act pretty calmly and rationally and I'm always trying to figure out how to help the team and others. So if, if there's something that needs to be dealt with, to help the team or other people that are impacted by this, then I'll do that."

I'm imagining that's Well I guess a workspace could not be organized if there's just a lot of clutter. There are times when my desk, or my workspace or not, they are very cluttered. And I do have that tendency sometimes, but maybe at the end of the week, I'll just decide. Okay, that that's, I've had enough. I'm just going to spend some time cleaning it up, so I won't I don't say it goes on for too long and it's generally I try to keep things in order. Now, if it's, if you're referring to, maybe a team being this organizer, how a team operates be disorganized, that that is a larger problem. Sometimes there's easy fixes, but usually, the fixes take a lot of time to to actually resolve. There could be personalities on the team that makes it difficult to fix or help the team. So, It could be a lot of steps that a team has to work through and usually, since I'm on the agile team, that's where we have retrospectives and that can be very helpful for figuring out. What are we doing on this team or this project that's disorganized or unproductive or inefficient? And that's where we seek out ways to find better. Better means to solve something."

I'm always willing to do any test set before me even something that I'm not too familiar with. I love learning and exploring different size of myself. I also enjoy just working generally. I will say that. My weaknesses is that I do have moments where it takes me a little bit longer than others to really get going. But once I do get going, I get on a row and I really just focus on the test and hand and I feel like that I am essentially a dog with a bone when I am working.

My best friend would describe me as probably kind of a knucklehead as well. Just someone who is always, always just looking for ways to, like, just joke with you and, you know, be light-hearted and not really focused on anything. - I definitely know that my Was say that I'm generally someone who is just typically always positive and always looking for like the bright side of things.

I like to get a greater. Picture overall as a whole. And I think that, that could definitely affect my status or money-making situation and both positive and negative lights because I do typically I do typically like to avoid making rash decisions about any sort of professional like situation.

I'm not generally too focused on going out of my way to try to really befriend people. And that's only because of the fact that I've always been really shy and reserved and it's just dates back to just my childhood and not necessarily having the greatest of time or easiest of time of making new friends. But once I Did make friends that were similar to me or once I started talking to people and force myself to get out of my shell. I discovered that the people that I thought that I couldn't really open up to were a lot more like me than I realized. But I also find that it's generally really, okay? At the end of the day to be reserved and quiet, when I'm meeting a new group of people Because I feel like that my personality always shines through in the, long run based on the actions that I exhibit amongst people.

And I mean, I would get a 1 One on one with that person and generally just, I was generally just let that person know how they made me feel and why the situation. I mean, why the situation that is pertaining to them? Is upsetting to me? And I feel like that I am that way. I feel like I'm that way because I think that it's best to address a situation with someone had on if that person is annoying you in any way or does something because the only way that a person will know that the only way a co-worker or a fellow employee will know what your boundaries are and know that you are someone to be. that is, if you tell them that and I think that is perfectly possible to be professional About It by just making sure that the language and the wording that you use is, you know, respectful and it isn't coming from a belittle in place but also being firm in your stats with that individual"

Because even if I am in a work situation, where I know that I am not going to have my usual help, and I'm going to be doing more tests, aside from the ones that are generally assigned to me. I tackle things. one at a time and I don't tend to let it like overwhelming because my working my work in process is that if I have a lot of different tests to do and I know that is going to be a little crazy as I'm going through with it or even if I know that it's not something that I'm going to be able to finish by the end of the day, I still make sure that I work on one task at a time and I finish it completely before moving on to the next thing because if I don't do that I'll end up with a clutter workspace and my working my working like Mojo will be like no longer in effect at that point for lack of better term."

I try to focus on one thing at a time and do my best to achieve that specific goal. Other strength would be that very diligent. I like to get things done, precisely, and that's important to me because I like to see positive results. And as for weaknesses I would say one that might be a minor setback is that I tend to be a perfectionist in some senses with I like being so precise that it may undo my progress just because I'm focusing too much specifically. And I want to see just that, that's result. About that project. Other weakness might be that. I also try to get certain things done before others. I tend to get I don't know where to start for certain projects, I have a difficult time prioritizing so that might be another another weakness but of course I could work on that. No biggie. So yeah."

I'd like to try new things all the time and you might also say, well, he might say that hard to say. They might tell me tell you describe me as a very friendly person.

That could affect class status, how much money I can make. The number one thing for me, is monthly where, where would this situation? Put me and so my behavior would probably work like that first and foremost. So, You know that puts something like like a job interview. For example, I'm going now but there was a job I thought I might like then that would be the first priority for me so I would I would be the main reason why I would be applying for that job in the first place. On the clue is ladder, for example, if it was a job I dislike, I would probably not be there in the first place just because I put mine. I'm a cool well-being. First, my, do I think that is I think, I don't know. Just like that's just the first priority for me, and I think it should be for others too. I know. It's not all the time.

I like to find simulator similarities between us. To me, I find that usually is a good Icebreaker gives you gives people and myself Common Grounds to work. It kind of easy easy. The tension of meeting new people And I think that's the main goal. When I enter a new team is try to get myself a miliar and comfortable with each person there. And why do I think that is? I think that is mainly because those achieve the best results. The more comfortable, you are and your team, the more open you are to sharing ideas showing criticism. I think that is the main contributor and progressing as a team, I think it's very important to have those attributes if you're in a team. And yeah. I think. It helps the team to grow recently.

Wonder what exactly about them is annoying me and if I find I can't, I have trouble doing that. I might tend to distance myself or just ignore the annoyances and focus on only the positive aspects that that listen, I don't think that is just out of Sure Comfort obviously being annoyed is not a positive feeling for the most part.

I'd say that's very not typical for me despite my background background here, I promise you. My front desk is a lot more organized and say, it's not very typical at all. I tend to keep things very organized and I think that is because I like the order I like knowing where things are way things are, I find it, it's help. Awful for efficiency. So the only time that maybe typical is when in the process of completing a big project and I tend to get more disorganized and normal. But even then, at some point in the project, I will make sure to check that out. Reach a benchmark and make sure I set aside some time to organize. The things I need to organize, so I can proceed proceed with the project and then organized fashion and I prime minister's best for medication, see best for my own well-being. That's just what I thought easiest for me. But so, yeah, I'll come. That's the main main thing I'm looking for"

I do that everyday in my current job. I'm a consultant. And so I work for myself in every decision that I make has an effect on how much I can build my client and how much they might be willing to pay me the way that I treat those situations is that I look for what is best both for the client and myself. I don't want to overcharge my clients and I want to do what I think is fair. And the reason I do that is because I consider myself to be a very fair person. And I hope that I look out for the interests of everybody involved."

As I am joining, the new team, they know more than I do as to what is going on with the work situations and with what's going to be expected of the team. And so their knowledge is going to be really valuable to me. Me. And so that's why I always try to listen."

I know that everybody has a different personality type and has a different way of dealing with things. And one way is not necessarily better than the other people are going to react the way that they are going to react. And so I try to diffuse the situation by letting the person who is annoying me just finish what they're doing and then I can extricate myself from this situation.

I don't like to waste time, looking for things or searching for things or not being able to find things. I like being able to accomplish my tasks quickly and efficiently and effectively. And so being organized is really important for that."

I've got my own business that I work towards pretty much every day. They was probably describe me as pretty fun for you as well.

What I should with my level and I can always behaved pretty. Well, me situations could dictate if this is a company that is worth staying at or I could be better off, moving on to a different place.

I take a lot of pride in doing a good job. It goes beyond the simple nature of earning a paycheck for me it's in to get emotionally attached to a job and see its successes and failures as my own. It just gives me a tremendous feeling of like self pride to know that I've done a good job. Of that. I am building a company. And then I can honest this. Like look at the results of my work, not just for myself but in the context of the company, as a whole and say I did that, I was responsible for improving the company because I think when you Kind of give off that energy, it, inspires the people around you, like I don't have a tremendous need for power. I don't necessarily need to be the manager or tell you no other employees what to do. But if I'm leading, by example, it just kind of creates a very Positive work culture where everyone is going to want to take personal investment in their work and feel like they're part of the company. To I'd say, one of my weaknesses is that Definitely second-guess myself, sometimes I get anxious and I kind of overthink things and we'll kind of get a little too deep in the Weeds on in terms of details and that can kind of hold me back. Like it's not going to really affect my efficiency. Like I'm very good with my time and making sure the deadlines are met but sometimes I just find that I end up putting in more work that's necessary because I'm like going back in like double-checking my work. I work when I know fundamentally that I got it right already and I don't think there's anything wrong with being cautious or just making absolutely sure you did a great job but not if it's going to prevent you from being able to move on from a task. So fortunately, I've efficient enough, like I said, where it's not going to really affect my, the speed of my work or Getting tasks done or anything like that, but I could probably already be on to another task or project if I just kind of Let It Go."

Like, I don't understand. Like, if I was to ask somebody, like, what do you do in your spare time? What are your hobbies and interests? And they're like, oh I just hang out my friends and watch Netflix. And that's pretty much all I do when I'm not at work and that's Is fine. If that is something that brings them happiness. That's great. But for me, I would just kind of find that existence not very filling. There's so much Beauty and interest and culture in the world. And I think it's our responsibility to get out there into Try new things and interact with new ideas and kind of make ourselves a more well-rounded person as we interact with this beauty and you know that can be art or good food you know, just so many sensory things out there that we can emotionally engage with. And I think it just really makes us more fulfilled people and that's going to benefit us. On a work level 2 because happy people tend to be happy workers. So that is probably biggest things that they would say. I'm very ethical, they would say that. I just I think it's very important to follow rules and laws and do the right thing. And a lot of that is tied to my values of. I'm just very protective of people from underserved underrepresented groups. Regardless of gender or ethnicity or sexuality. And I really bring that into the workspace to where I just feel that we need to have true diversity and give everybody a fundamental chance to succeed."

Looking out, not just for myself but my co-workers and the company as a whole like I said, I'd tend to get very emotionally invested when I work with a company and it's not really. The amount of pay that I have, obviously, I want to have a comfortable life. I want to be able to pay my bills. I know my worth and you know, I want to definitely be paid a fair wage, but making money is not my soul. Motivation for doing work. That is you know one of the biggest and best results of doing work. But if I can benefit others through my work, I mean even on a fundamental level if we were talking just like retail sales, just helping a customer out and giving them great customer service, helping them find a product that fits their needs or wants and leaves them satisfied because they know that they dealt with someone who is Treating them with respect, treating with honesty wasn't just trying to make a sale for sale sake and they're going home with something. Whether it's a product or service that is going to leave them happy, then that's a success for me and much in the same way with coworkers and managers and the company. As a whole if I'm doing good acts, that are going to benefit them and makes their lives a little bit better. In improves things for those around me that I know that I'm on the right. Right, track. So went to say that. How do I behave in these situations that affect my status or how much money I make? I'm going to always be consistent. The work I do. I'm just you know going to try to do my very best to do the right thing."

But now that I have this here generally I have a little bit of social anxiety, it doesn't hold me back too much, but when I first get into a new setting, a new group, sometimes, it could take me a little bit to come out of my shell. I understand the importance of being professional and pushing through that to do my work. So I don't think it's really going to hinder me but especially if I'm introduced to several new people at once. We're going to be working closely and working on projects together. Sometimes it takes be a little bit to kind of open up and feel my confidence and kind of put my ideas out there. A lot of that is kind of respect to, I'm learning other people. I don't want to come into bullish in, you know, impose my will on other people. But it's also a comfort thing and I think that's fine. I think that, you know, there's unfortunately, some people who never get comfortable in a work setting and there's some people who will kind of just fold in on themselves and isolate rather than making an effort. So it's like, I know, this is something that I struggle with a little bit and so it's just always an opportunity to do a little bit better in to push through that. So I think the best way to do that is kind of just listen, kind of pick up on people's roles in the group and see where we can go from there."

I think we're all going to enter situations where we meet somebody and through specific actions of their as or different personality traits that kind of rub us the wrong way. But generally speaking, when it comes to work, I just understand that, you know, a healthy work culture where everyone is getting along and able to collaborate and do their jobs together is going to be the most important thing. So, I think it's kind of interesting and important where you say, how do I react to that situation? A lot of times especially in a professional setting, I simply do not react only. If it ever becomes an issue where I feel that the person if it transcends into something like they're behaving unethically, or they become threatening in their behavior. Or if they have behaved towards me in a way that is completely inappropriate for a workplace setting. Will I act upon that? But, you know, I think there's something to be said for being the bigger person. There's something to be said for leading by example and, you know, sometimes you just have to leave that at the door and come in and do your job to the best of your ability. And while, you know, even if you're in a team where you're working closely together, I think there's opportunities to be able to step back a little bit and getting your composure or kind of At yourself from the person in question so that you know, it's not going to become an issue, but ultimately, it's a learning experience. If I know that someone is going to be someone, I'm not going to click with. In terms of compatibility at work then you know I can even learn from that knowledge of how best to handle them and handle the situation."

That it's just very important to be aware of my organization my cleanliness. Keeping clutter to a minimum and a lot of this ties to my belief that efficiency is hugely important in the workplace and you just cannot be efficient. If you can't find your tools, can't find the information. You need things are just you know ought to place stashed underneath other things. Everything's a mess. But also, once again, it goes back to what I was talking about about leading by example. And I feel like if I I whether it's in my cubicle space or if I have my own office or out on the sales floor, if I'm presenting organization, then that's going to set a standard for other people to follow. And it's just simply tied to my beliefs about professionalism. I want to come into work looking presentable, ready to work, and I need my materials to also be prepared and Ready for work as well. So I'm not saying that I have not always been completely organized. No I am saying yeah sorry I missed phrase that I'm not saying that there have not been times where I have not been organised it is happened before, a lot of it is sometimes tied to like time crunch or a really busy season or something like that, but, you know, when in doubt if I'm not actively working on a project. I need to take that time to get everything organized because it's just going to benefit me in the"

I don't like to leave things undone and I like to make sure that problems are resolved and that I know why the problem happened in the first place. So it doesn't happen again. I enjoy researching things and explaining why a thing happened and using that information to make things happen. More efficiently, one of my greatest weaknesses is probably The same thing because I don't like not knowing I don't like when the answer is just because it's the way it is. And I absolutely feel crazy when I hear somebody say. But that's how it's always been because that's never a good excuse for a system being inefficient and not working correctly. I think another strength is that I like working with people and people are generally receptive to working with me. I've always had a good working relationship with everybody I've ever worked with. I've never had any kind of conflicts with people that were due to personality or Conflicts that were interpersonal. There were external factors every now and then, but I get along with everybody.

I think she would say that I should be more confident in myself and more Brave as far as I've always wanted to start a business and things like that and she has one and I'm a little jealous. And I think she would also say that even though we live very different lives, she has kids, I don't she owns her own business. I don't that we find common ground and are able to work together on projects that we've done and Keep in touch even when it's hard because we're far away from each other.

I'm having a little trouble coming up with an answer for when I've made a decision professionally that could affect my status or how much money I make. I suppose one of the biggest upheavals in my career life has been when I worked in an IT department at a New York at a university that was outsourced. And we were told we had until IPM that day to decide if we wanted to work for the new company. It was the same pay and it was worse benefits. And I did decide to stay at least for then because it was that or not have a job. If I had left at the time I could have taken unemployment and possibly gotten a job that paid more, and I probably should have done that looking back. So I think that deciding to take the safe route in that at that point in my life was probably not the best thing I could have done. But I did my work for the new company and I ended up leaving about half a year later, but in the meantime, I did the job that I had. I don't believe in showing up for work, and not doing my job. So, I was loyal. As an employee until the day I left, but I do think that if I had left, I probably would have been able to find a similar, it job for another nonprofit, which is a goal of mine. And probably been better off financially, but I made the decision I made, so here we are."

So my behavior usually involves sitting back a little bit kind of getting to know everybody before trying to find my own place on the team because I don't want to just Barrel in and disrupt what they have going on. If it is a good dynamic. Why do I behave like that? Because I don't want to disrupt the group as it exists. I want to be a good addition. And not a disruptive addition, unless they need disrupting in, which case, maybe that's why I was hired. But I think it's important to take a minute before barely my way in, like I said, and just changing the group arbitrarily instead of giving them some time to get to know me and trust me as a co-worker and me getting time to know. Them and trust them as co-workers. So I think it's important to slowly get to know people and get to know their work Styles and their personalities and see where I can best make a space for myself. I think it's important to not just try to take over especially if I was coming in a supervisory role I wouldn't want to just start telling people what to do who know how to do their jobs better than I do. I think that is one of the biggest pitfalls that I've seen. When I've gotten new managers, so I would want to try to avoid that."

So usually my reaction is pretty non-existent because in retail, you learn to not react when somebody is rude or unkind or maybe a little off-kilter and strange and demanding. And so I feel like I have a really good foundation for Even if I get annoyed, which is really uncommon at this point, not showing that I'm annoyed and trying to resolve whatever the issue is, that is causing friction that also covered the. Why? Because I have a lot of experience doing it. I have a lot of experience in high-stress retail positions, grocery stores, and I worked in jewelry during the Christmas season. I worked at a Kmart when I was a teenager, so I have a lot of experience dealing with people in Potentially stressful situations, especially retail over Christmas and resolving any issues that I have with people without generally showing them. I'm annoyed, I think I've only displayed annoyance at people maybe three or four times in my entire career and those were excessive situations where I had concerns for safety, but I don't generally get annoyed with people."

Space is organized. But if somebody asked me where something is I can say oh that's under that pile under the form that I need to send out tomorrow. So it's not really a matter of it, being disorganized for me. It's a matter of other people looking at it and it potentially being disorganized, if other people have to use that workspace, I wouldn't do that. That if it's my personal workspace that nobody will have to worry about aside from me, it may look cluttered and that's pretty typical for me. It always has been but I also really like making sure I know where everything is. So I use sticky notes and a filing process I have containers and I make sure I know where everything is and at any given point in time, I also a lot of the time we'll do things digitally and just save digital. Miles in a in a way that makes sense like an organized file structure. I'm much better at organizing a file structure than I am at organizing physical space. Most of the physical space dis organism what appears to be this organization is again because of neuro Divergence. There's some there's some studies about that. That are really interesting but they're the studies, all say that. When people who are a nerd neurodivergent, can't see, something is gone. So I keep a lot of things out so that I can keep track of them. So either I organized it digitally or by keeping it somewhere where I can see it in an order. That makes sense to me at times when I've been very busy occasionally, my workspace has looked disorganized because I've had papers spread out that I needed to work off of in multiple ways. Ways. But they're always cleaned up afterward. I don't like having a lot of papers out because they do get lost things, get buried and then they get lost and not handled, and I don't like not handling things. So, I always make sure that if I do have a lot of papers out, I work with them as much as I need to and then they either get scanned or thrown away whatever I can do to make sure those stay off my desk."

I can take criticism personally pretty decently often. Where I even if someone is trying to give me a helpful advice, in a nice way, I can personally I can feel upset about it just because I want them to be happy with me which is not a good thing because you should be able to take criticism and something that I am working on, but I recognize it currently has a flat that I have."

That have the same job description in the same field of work that I'm already in, but they just happened to pay about her and they might have better benefits or just be a better company overall.

I don't feel it would be comfortable if a new person came into my group and started trying to make us all change, it was acting very inappropriate. I think it would be more.

But if you ignore them that they won't get the satisfaction. They'll just go on sooner, but if they're on essentially doing It then I try to recognize that.

It's just like this place papers and stuff which is okay. And I try to organize those who never get a break just because there's always going to be a new mass. And if you put it off for too long, then you will probably miss. You'll probably lose an important paper. And that can become an issue later on and I don't like that to become an issue. I'd rather just prevent it to start off with. So I don't think it's very typical that might work or work place is very unorganized. Yeah, I think that's just his my job. I don't think that has to do very much of my upgrading upbringing or like, my personal life, where people around me because I think in all of those facets, people have been pretty unorganized. But I've just learned through work to be more organized, to accept that."

I've gotten, I don't know, three, four, five, different degrees, both. Aren't you Sarah. And as to acquitted universities, I have a wide base of skills. I have an MBA, I have a chemistry degree. I have a writing degree. So I find myself generally Be able to take on most tasks from many angles of learning. I, I think that I have the ability to learn new skills rapidly and to take those skills and put them into use in my job. And in my life, most of my friends, find the angle, he's the along with, I'll take lead and responsibilities were necessary, but if that's not the case, then I'm more than happy to work on a team and give In support of my leaders goals. My biggest weakness probably is I, well I'll Excel mundane tasks and things that are kind of slow and boring. I'd rather have a challenging job. It's Dynamic and pushes my skills and and so, I'm always looking for a situation where I have something new to learn new people, new responsibilities. So I guess that all told I bring a lot. Of skills, a lot of learning and knowledge, a hunger for knowledge, and the ability to get along with people lead them when necessary step back and support them if that's relevant. So I think my, you know, my 40-year working career. I've shown all of that, you can review my pass preferences, people that I worked with, and I think it would universally agree to that as something that, you know, that they have. Have have found in working with me. I've basically always been the last man that had. Oh, we need somebody do this and I'd want to learn and do it my current job. I used to be a product manager, but I also database skills and I had a lot of other skills that were outside the domain, my job. So I was doing all these things for all the other people. And so I think that that would pretty much summarized what I would bring is my greatest strengths and"

Well, I think that would be probably an evening and some drinks to hear the whole story I have made friendships from high school and college that have gone 40 years. We've been married together divorce together, you know, just planned retirement, stay there. So they would describe me as amiable and supportive always able to listen there when they needed me, I try to Give you no moral any kind of sport, I can, I'm a person who believes that, what you give to our friendship, you get more than back in dividends and in that relationship. So I think they describe me as intelligent and caring and able to listen and not afraid to stand up for what's right? So, I think that, you know, we've been through a lot. So my best friend A lot to say and I think all told it has been a good run and build, they look forward to what's coming next because we're always growing and changing supporting each other."

Well, the Biggest what I think was, when I was in Kansas City in 1993 and my kids were in eighth grade in high school and they shut down. The event has headquarters, rowers working mood at New Jersey. They gave everyone a job in New Jersey if they wanted to move. But if you didn't, they gave you a pretty good package and so because my kids couldn't move. I decided to take the package and start my career over in Kansas City and they moved out and when I took the package and Resign my position. I couldn't find an equal position in Kansas City and so after about six months of looking, I thought Something's Gotta change here. And so I went back to Penn State and got a statistics degree. And when I came back with my MBA, and my sister degree, I got my current job with GE and so I took a step back, got more education. And when I came back, I had a better position with more skills. Kind of a gamble, you know, I had, I not gone back to school. I may not have gotten an equal job that I had given up because of the moving of the site, but all told, I think it worked out for the best by far. But there were moments when I thought, boy, this was a stupid decision and I assure need a job now, but it worked out well. And I took a gamble, a risk for the family and it paid off. And my career two and three years later was much Better than they would have been had. I not step back and resigned my position and got more education and came back. So I think that, you know, my status probably took a step back and thereafter, it has been better off if the best thing that I could have done for my career."

Probably about every two years at my current company site. Eva my staff is I've a help desk in India and our developers are in Poland. We have a site in Stockholm and wanted to London. So what I joined this team, it wasn't Americans with my background. So I had to kind of step back and And learn the culture and what you know, these people thought were kind of the proper ways to comport yourself and, and how to deal with this, besides having a job around the clock, because, you know, the Sun never set on the British Empire, but the way our company was laid out globally and never said on our responsibility. So, I had to, take out time to get to know the people and the culture and their work Style and what to expect for them and what they expected for me. So, so when joining a new international team, there's a lot of growth and learning and understanding, and that you bring to it. And so, it is made me a richer person. My Life is Richer. I mean, I was spent time and A lot of time in Europe prior to covid were, you know, I was there for a couple weeks and got to know the culture and the people and their families. And so when I have joined with a new team, you just got to step back and get to know the people and you get to know what the responsibilities. They're working Styles. What they expect, what you bring them to let them know you be open. So all of those you know, have gone to my constant learning and my love of people and different stuff. So I enjoy joining a new team. There's a little bit of stress up front but your life's richer and you're a better employee and a better person if you Embrace that and grow from that."

And generally, I haven't been annoyed very much. I, I kind of have a lot of deadlines that I have to do. We are in month in quarter, and quarter blessings that type of stuff. And there have been times when I was under a Time deadlines and needed inputs from some of my other managers, or Hers or whatever and it is kind of annoying waiting because you're kind of helpless waiting for their response, their data, their input or whatever it is. And so I've had to try to gently try to remind them that I had this coming due date that I need something to work on and that would they please get their stuff back to me so I can do my job which can be frustrating. But at the same time those people have deadlines and demands on their time and so they really You know, I'm sure they're doing the best you can, so you have to be understanding yet. Let them know that you had, these needs in this deadline and that this has to be done for you so that you can do your job and so, you know, it said it can be frustrating knowing but I don't necessarily think that they're tried to be, you know, give me less than what they could give other people. So I just think you had to have some empathy that you're working with other people and you have to, you know, understand They're probably the best they can and it said gently remind them or, you know, dude, reach out and say, well, what's going on? Can I get you some more data or some more support to get your portion in so it can be a situation where you go better than a person and get to know them better or get you know more confidence to them or vice versa. So you know, you try to make it a positive and it says work environment. You're going to work with them in the future so you do the best you can and keep things civil."

Well, as I said, I have a global job and I get different cultures and different demands different deadlines, and all that kind of stuff. So, the nature of my job is been kind of chaos. It's been pulling out of this, multi-national situation the best you can. And then there's Goldman, I mean I had an office and everything else before covid and When covid hit, we were working remotely for a couple of years and then we went back to the office and it was open seating. And so your workspace is disorganized, you go in one day, you're here and you're there an exercise, not a desk with your kids picture on it and stuff. Like there had been the previous 35 years of my career. So you have to kind of work light and you have to be able to go into the situation and set up your workstation and your meetings and and flourish without the 925 office that you had before. Or and so both the nature of who I work with when I work because my job, you know, never really starts or ins. It's just a continuous Global support situation. So I may be working for my home one day and he might office the next a different desk. And so, the nature of my work space is turned into this Dynamic here there 24/7. I'm here today over there tomorrow across from next day. So, I by Nature prefer having an office in a standard work space, where a, I have everything where I know it is, but the nature of life and my job and everything especially related, with covid has made it a situation where that's not the case. So you just have to make the best of what you got and flourish in that environment."

I like the odds of me just coming up to you and talking to you is pretty low, unless I need something from you, or if it's work-related it's just kind of always, always been always kind of been a solo person, you know, independent person,"

Or, you know, just get away from them distance myself. Try Not to cause any issues just because I've, you know, I've dealt with that before, where you make it awkward as someone and it's just, you have to pass by them every day, and it's just awkward. word and so I try my best, you know, not let that happen, but If it's like, you know, if it's not like home or, you know, somewhere on the streets or whatever, and someone's annoying me, you know, I'm kind of a straight-up person.

I had stated earlier that's I'd say that's probably my biggest flaw. That is like a parent noticeable. That kind of affects my life. It's just I've always just been so unorganized. Like, I don't I don't really know. I mean, it could part partially be due to laziness and I've always kind of been the person that I don't like to pay attention to the like small details and like, you know, as long as I know where everything is and you know, it like works and functions to get what I need to get done that. I don't really care. But It's kind of weird because I like, you know, I'll get into like a little details, you know, for like technical indicators for markets and like, you know, just like that kind of stuff, but when it comes to like stuff like that, like, organizing or doing a small objects, like let's say, like, you know, sewing, like putting like that little string in the needle, you know, like that kind of stuff, like, pisses me off to no other just doing a little tiny, tedious, stuff like that. So, I mean, I've just always seen organization is like a chore. Yeah, I could partially be due to laziness. I've just, I've always been like, I've always been very unorganized since I could remember. I've tried improving it, I think I've gotten a little bit better, but it's still definitely a flaw."

I've given my weaknesses is I help too much. I just want to make sure I help as much as possible. So, that leaves little room for error which is something I tend to overdo a lot.

I tend to act the same in all situations and that's just giving honest responses and honest opinions about how I feel about the situation or how I feel about my performance or coworkers or anything like that. So I just feel that if you're honest and above board about everything that you just act the same in all situations and it's just easier to do that than get all nervous about one situation being different from another. I think all situations just about being open and honest.

And the job I was doing was probably Performed for the most part by younger people. So I felt like I had to prove myself a little bit more than normal but I'm a hard worker on anything I do. So it really wasn't. I didn't have to exert much effort because I just did what I would normally do and that ended up being how I proved myself. So but usually I go in with self confidence and knowing my ability to perform usually takes away a lot of the tension or the stress that I might feel."

So as long as you can look past, what people would call the annoying part, Hearts and see what's what is actually causing that reaction. It makes it easier to handle and to deal with and know that they're not trying to be that way. They're usually just reacting to something. They may feel uneasy about or that they may not be able to do. So if you look past that, it's a lot easier. ER, two to know that they're not being annoying."

That's just how I've always been. I've always been a neat person and like things organized and in their place so that can be resolved very easily and that's just the way I've always been.

I'm not someone that really thinks that it's my way or the highway I do enjoy getting feedback from others and I do like to apply that and make things work better. Her in my everyday life. When I do that, that feedback. And I think that may be one of my greatest weaknesses is that generally, I am a bit of a people pleaser and due to that, I do try and make too many people happy at once. I may be a detriment to myself, I probably have Kanaan too much at some points where I should have, maybe shared the workload more, it is something that I am working on and I think that it's kind of like a difficult skill to balance at times.

I'm someone that has a lot of empathy for other people as well as other living things, animal lover. So I think that generally I'm the one that's a bit shy. I have a hard time like being a loud and boisterous person so I guess I am generally someone that likes to kind of operate from behind the scenes more. I think that I'm a bit bookish and someone that Once you get to know me, you feel like I'm pretty trustworthy and it's comfortable to be around me. However, I think that upon first meeting me might feel like I'm someone that doesn't like people that much, which isn't really true. I'm someone that likes you all quite a bit. I'm just a little bit shy."

The first thing I really have to think of is, what is the longevity of the situation? Is this something that I can keep up? Or is this something that is going to wear thin over time? Is this something that's not going to be stimulating enough over time? So, I think that usually In those situations, I try to act a little cautious. I try to not make any sort of decision tastily. I really want to make sure that I have all the information available to me. So I think that I act pretty responsible in those situations. I think the reason why I do that is because It's typically the right thing to do. I think that, you know, I'm someone that probably I can admire someone that's willing to take a lot of chances and you know, take that leap of faith but I'm someone that would rather be able to say with certainty that I am making the best decision possible. So I think that is probably why I act that way."

So generally, when I enter your new team, I'm someone that likes to kind of listen and observe see what is going on. See what the group dynamics are of the team first, I'm not someone that is going. To steal steal the show. Make myself center of attention in a team or anything like that. I think that another thing that I will do is I will usually try and observe who the people in the group or the team are that seem like they are the ones that are kind of leaders and I will approach them and try to ask them questions and see how Things kind of work on that team. It always try to act really friendly and approachable to everyone. The reason I do this is It's kind of just my personality. I don't really, as I've said, in other things, I don't even being the center of attention. I'm not someone that likes a charge in there and take a leadership role. So, I I think that the way that I why I behaved like this is I really just want to get my bearing Street and know my surroundings are before I leap right into something."

I just interact with them. The least amount that I can get away with without having it seem like. I am purposely avoiding them or it is a detriment to my work any sort of way. So I think that for example, if there's someone in the group that is being very obnoxious and maybe talks over other people a lot, I would try to not even in conversation with them very often unless I had to I'm someone that doesn't really get angry very easily so I don't think that it would show too much that I was annoyed. I think that making any sort of A big deal about it or telling someone that you're annoying, them is just inviting them to press your buttons, more or feel a certain like anger or disdain towards you. So to me it seems like it makes more sense to just kind of try and minimize your contact with the person that is annoying, you rather than just go out of your way to be rude to them."

So it goes both ways where my works. These can be very organized or not very organized. How typical that is? I would say more often than not, my workspace is fairly organized once in a while. It will kind of get to a point where I need to take a step back and take a few moments to get it back in a state of I guess order I think that why that is is usually when it does get to that point, it's because I am really wrapped up in something and I haven't had a moment to thank or do anything other than the task I have at hand. So that's probably why it gets that way."

I like to have all my co-workers and I like when they help me, I'm also really great at making friends. I love being personable with my clients as well as my co-workers and and even my law says, oh my greatest weaknesses are probably that I struggle when there's a a lot of downtime. It's hard for me to kind of find stuff to fill my time when there's nothing pressing to get done or if I have no objectives coming up, so yeah."

A lot of random troops together. You kind of hitting each other up, last-minute, a lot and just dry each other along to it was going on.

I definitely think that it's important to like stand your ground, know your worth and express that. While also being compassionate and hearing the other person's point of view. And I think that's because of how I was raised by. Guys, definitely brought up to be very like you're the best that you can be and you are worth every penny of it.

When I go your new team, I try and be very friendly to everyone and kind of get a lay of the land, how everyone interacts with each other and what the general like environment is. And then after I kind of get a sense for that, I start to warm up a little bit more and I'm kind of shy on the outside. So takes me a minute to like, really let my personality come out. And I've always been Been that way I was always kinda shy in school until someone is really my friend. I think that's just kind of continued on to my adult life.

I don't say anything. I don't react, I was kind of process. It mentally my brain and move on. If it's something that's happening often or occurring a lot, then I will bring it up to that person. First face-to-face be like hey, Like this happened and it made me feel this way. Maybe in the future. We could go this way. What do you think? And try and come up with a solution that works for everyone if they're not receptive to that, then I would go to someone higher up to help facilitate the conversation. But I'm definitely going first or first face-to-face first with that person, if it's an issue and otherwise I'm keeping it to myself because you don't need to are everything."

Wherever I like to have a very neat and tidy station area and have everything in line. And my personal world, my house is definitely more very unorganized and I think that kind of stems from like having to keep everything perfect at work to not wanting to have a perfect at home, but I definitely action better with a clean space."

Peacefully, complete, my assignment or Mission or tasking and so doing that is it's almost I'm not afraid to ask people and come to terms with that. Hey, I don't know the answer and say to people that I would appreciate if you could help me understand and produce an answer for this assignment. Something about weaknesses are always been slightly more shy, not what I'm in charge. How does the subordinate? But like with my equal peer groups like if I'm a manager and I'm dealing with another manager, I sort of have a natural inclination to trust the other manager to do the right thing or not to Not too, that's make a mistake and so I won't always. I feel like I don't speak up often enough when I maybe see something going wrong with somebody at my level, but I will always always take care of my subordinates and talk to my superiors and keep them informed and search for my weakness. This is something that I've I used to be worse at, but now I've improved with time and I'll continue to improve on it. And really, that's just accepting that things aren't going to always go well and to be constructive and not overly critical, but to work together as a team."

When it comes to a personal growth, having been in a variety of stressful experiences and professional working life. And adapting and overcoming, and then ultimately being successful in those situations as well as being a source of comfort during difficult times whether professionally or personally, and in doing so taking care. Of a team or a friend are making team members feel like friends so that they can confide in you and seek find some Solace and so we can reorient to get back on the assignment or Topic at hand. I found also labeled me as someone who's physically strums and terms of that side lifting things but like I have and I can do that but it's also the endurance to go long hours to deal with a variety of issues may be cropping up in the short amount of time and working through it through extended hours or acquiring a lot of pencil resiliency to get through the problems."

I will work towards something that is tangible because I've seen a lot of people go down. A lot of rabbit holes for per half. Whispered promises and Kudos should abs and never materialized. And so where I've gotten today is working diligently, being friendly. Taking care of my subordinates, looking out for my soup. Visors and working with my teammates. And Getting them making them successful because when you do that ultimately your reviews prove as well as just your interpersonal relationships cause people to like you and support you in your endeavors to promote and grow when you're talking about status or money. So I've had a series of promotions of my life and it's not something I planned out in two years in advance. It was something, That when it with these opportunities came on to the market, I use existing relationships, I use my existing demonstration of abilities to share that, I was ready to receive that, that bump and status and pay."

And I think it's the most important thing you can do is be disarming is that don't act like you already know everything don't act like you're going to change everything. Come in seek, an understanding about where they're coming from, what some of their issues are, who they are, as people, maybe some of our icebergs, emotional icebergs things, you want to tread carefully on and so that's just for introductions. And then you also find it very valuable, hit the books. What's expected of you, what is the organizational chart? And And a real treasure Trove, what's happening is to go look through historical files. Look on the sharetribe. Look through filing cabinets and see. Okay, what's been happening since last year, two years, five years, even 10 years ago that brought us to this point. What are the numbers? What are the qualitative aspects? And I find when you do all this, you get a good understanding of the climate, the business climate of what's going on in the, in the system. And then who is operating in this climate, and what their concerns are, what their needs are. And because it's not a one and done, you're going to work with these people for a long time. And ultimately be successful, you must understand. Then And adapt to how they are and to get to get the most from your chart, more flies with honey than you do vinegar and so just always found that to work the best and it's led to a series of promotions and elevations and status."

And I think really the important part is how you deal with it. And for me, I very much internalize it and you take it, take it inside me and I kind of push it down and I don't really portray much in outward expressions of annoyance or I'm never rude or condescending and I don't escalate situations when people are annoying. Me I find it's best to defuse situations. Operations, I find it best to turn a cheek to be the bigger person and the discussion and not let people get the better of you whether they're doing it purposefully or unintentionally, I think, you know, with unintentional annoyances, you certainly never correct publicly, but there's nothing wrong with taking someone aside perhaps in their office. And explain to him. Hey this is I felt a slight or I felt an issue with what you said or what you did. And I want to address this with you just, so we're clear about what's going on. And during that I think you're typically find most people in rational and reasonable and they will come around and maybe make some incremental improvements will generally understanding and do care about being presentable."

So I don't keep a lot of papers or file folders stuff like that around, just because it's Overture to inventory and move things and fought search for things manually. But so much of its gone digital. Now, usually I like to make all my products on working on very public with my work team or the suitable customer is needed. And that requires A lot of organizations. Now so I think the times when it's not as organized is when you're not working for your team or you have something in draft or development and things may get a little more disorganized on your personal machine or on your desk as you're trying to work through something. But that's not the typical response for me. Typical response is to have everything where if I was calling tomorrow people could unravel the history in relatively short order of what's going on, how I got there and then how they can continue the job. I think, other than being a generation that's into digital sorting. I think I just have an internal Sensible desire for organization. It calms me, makes me feel better when I leave at the end of the day. I can. Get work a little further out of my head if things are compartmentalised literally and figuratively."

I would say that I can be too much of a perfectionist. Sometimes, I Find myself where I tend to be too worried about getting it, perfect. And sometimes that's not appropriate for the situation. So, yeah. But the organizational is I enjoy it. I'm good at it. It's helpful for me, it's helpful for people that I work with or volunteer with"

I'm the one that tends to persuade people to stay and do more, and keep going versus calling it a night. So, definitely, they would say that I am persuasive, but also that I have a big part. I've typically been the person that people go to when they need help whether it's financially or Mental support or just needing to get some help with some stuff done, whether it's their house or whatever it might be, I'm the one that people typically come too."

So I'll make lists of the good in the bad and I tend to jump and go for it. If it's, you know, something where I might have to move to get a new promotion or more opportunities or if changing companies or tweaking the field that I'm in means that it's going to be better for me in the long run. I'm not afraid to do that and I will jump in with both feet and do that. I don't know exactly why I'm like that. I know a lot of people have a hard time with that but I think it's how I was brought up. Just always being told to do you know, whatever you put your mind to. You can do just always knowing that always being told that living in that environment. So I definitely will, you know, put in the, you know, the extra hours, the time, the move for the company, if they need me to go somewhere, if it means that it's going to put me in a better situation."

But quieter, I try to get to know people a little bit. I have a very loud personality and I don't like to come off as too overbearing with people. And so when I'm meeting, new people are working with new people on a project or task. I like, Like to, you know, kind of be a little bit more reserved so that I'm not too overwhelming, you know, not giving off the wrong impression. I don't want people to feel intimidated or question, you know, who I am, or what's going on? I like to know what people's personalities are. Like, kind of helps me, understand better how to interact with them. Some people, you know, like to be very specific. So I'd like to get to know people and kind of understand how they work before. I let myself get too comfortable."

I I would say that I tend to be a little bit more. Reserved on how I respond to that. I think it's because I always bartended on the side that's kind of a side gig throughout my life regardless of what my career was. And so you're always dealing with people with, you know, weird quirks or, you know, obnoxious behavior or people asking a lot of questions repeatedly. And so I think it just made me a little bit more tolerant that, you know, if somebody's annoying if they're not being hurtful, Or mean, or impacting my productivity or the group's productivity. Then I tend to just, you know, roll with it and not be too too frustrated by them. I mean, you know, sometimes it can get overwhelming, but it takes a lot. It takes a lot, a lot. You have to intentionally be trying to push my buttons to get me to that point. So like I said, typically I just, you know, just roll with it maybe an But just roll with it and do the best we can to work around it."

That something is not right. Typically I am the organized person. I am the one with the calendars. I am the one who knows the schedule, who can tell you next Tuesday at 9:00, there's a meeting with the commissioner's office or you know, the following Friday at 3:00. There's a meeting with the city clerk. I'm the one that's typically on top. Of schedules. Knowing what needs to be done when it needs to be done. So if I'm not organized typically, that's going to mean. That something is wrong, whether I'm sick physically where, you know, I've got some, you know, a virus or cold significantly, impacting me, or if there's some kind of turmoil going on at work, whether it's with, you know, a supervisor or somebody and we've not been able to resolve it. It or I'm feeling completely unappreciated. Those are times that I don't intentionally become an organized.

All the meetings, you know, I'm an introvert. So, you know, anything more than five hours of meetings in a day, is just going to wait me out, you're not going to get the best version of me, but I mean, I can still control myself.

I mean, only once, if I actually had the guts to ask for a raise, you know, I was six months into my management position and they asked me, you know, if you know, like when they told me, they hired me, they told me I was below. The range was like, okay, well now that I'm six months and I'm established. You guys clear? What you like me? How come I'm not? Getting paid at least at range. So, luckily I went on vacation, I came back and boom. I got a nice raised. So it was uncomfortable for me because I'm like, here I am advocating on behalf of my other teammates, the people that are direct reports and like, okay, well, you know, you all set there, you got to back yourself up to you. Got to advocate for yourself just like we have as parents, you have to advocate for your kids. So you know, that was a big choice for me to go for it.

I make as a boss where I'm thinking, well, this could end up on my review, but you never know how it's going to work out. You just say this is my compass going with my compass.

I broke bread with a few but I didn't know Mall very well. So especially Actually early on and taking over a new role I was pretty quiet and reserved and careful might with my words, the West words you use the West. You can put your foot in your mouth. So, you know for me I was very reserved and quiet and just listening. I want to make sure it is much. Listening is possible to gather as much information about each person so I can get to know them and start looking out for them and ask the right questions, you know, how can I help you? And sometimes you have to listen instead of talk to get some of those answers and I think it made a difference with the people I took over, you know, I'd be why should I to working with Yeah.

So, I carry that sort of Mentality with me, in terms of my work ethic, my weakness can be that. I tend to go everything alone, I don't delegate and I don't ask for help and I will tend to push myself past my own limits. A lot of the time and and that is definitely a weakness where it would be better for me to ask, for other people's help, and I can be a little too much of not giving other people enough room to to shine.

I think I tend to have just a handful of meaningful people in my life rather than a lot of acquaintances. I'm a believer that I would rather have four quarters than 100 pennies but that's just for myself personally. My best friend in the world died in 1993 and he died of AIDS. So,"

And it makes me kind of, I don't know, awkward with people, socially awkward. So I try very hard to get people to like me. Maybe I try too hard and then a lot of times, people just don't get or trust me. So it is what it is. Some, I'm kind of a love-hate person. People either love me or hate me. It took, it took me a while to learn how to be a team player and not to try to do everything myself. Especially when I worked as a paramedic because I was ultimately responsible for everything that everyone did around me and that was just way too much for my anxiety level.

And so I need to use those wheelchair seats, on the first row of the bus, which makes a lot of people annoy me, because where I live, a lot of people want to use those seats when they don't necessarily need them, and I actually need them. I can't get in and out of the regular ones and I don't have enough space. To get my Walker in and out of there. So I'm competing with people who want to have their Cargo in those spaces. A lot of the time and people who want to be in there because they want to watch their bicycle which is on that front rack at the front of the bus, people who have their E Scooters in that seat people who just don't need to be in the wheelchair seats that annoys the hell out of me. And what I've learned now is that if I get on the Us with my Walker and people don't get out of those wheelchair seats when they see me get on if I ask them they're not going to get out. They're going to lose their mind on me about it like as if I don't if I'm not entitled to those seats, if they don't understand that entitled to those seats because I'm disabled and they're not, they're not going to work with me that's really annoying as hell. So I handle it by I just stand there with my Walker. Like if they don't get up, when I get on, I just stand there and ride and just let them do what they're going to do because I don't have the mental health resources for that. So it's just easier for me to just do what I need to do."

Just a little stack of paper and my reading glasses, it's about it's about this high and it's just, you know, some mail and the authorizations from my doctor and a hair comb and just a few little knick-knack things and it's always about the same. It's always about this high. And I had to move it at one point when I moved my desk to clean the carpeting. So I picked all of that stuff up and she rubbed it into a bag and the little bag of everything that was on. That pile is still in that bag. From when I clean the carpet, now there's another pile, the same size that has taken its place. So clearly there's some part of my brain that thinks there needs to be a little pile of junk about this, big on the corner of my desk at all times. That's obviously just some malfunction. In my brain, that wants to stack things up on the corner of my desk. It doesn't need to be there but somehow in my brain, there needs to be just a minimal amount of clutter. Now, I'm not the person who wants to have color across the entire. I don't want to sit in a mountain of clutter, but my desk can't be just need is a little pin either. Now, maybe this year, I will actually get a nice little organizational system, get a proper filing cabinet because I don't have a proper filing cabinet system either and get a wall hanging organizer where I can put, you know, my bills and my medical stuff and Bubba. Blah, that would be great. But for now I will cop to having a slightly disorganized workspace at all times. Just as a function of the way, my brain is wired. I'll own it."

Outer space to move floor. Move forward in resolving the conflict. You can't force motivation on other people. You can only Give them resources and tools that would be helpful but you ultimately can't force someone to change their minds on things.

We never had enough employees there. And so main things really chaotic, we didn't really have time to do anything. We were just in a hurry, we had patients left and right and so things weren't very organized. That's not real typical of me unless it's something that I can't control. I like to stay organized. That way I know where everything is. I don't have an anxiety when I'm looking for something and can't find it. I know exactly where it is. I'm a pretty organized person. I like the neatness and Clem Clem Salinas. I think it just makes for a better day and makes you happier."

Solving things like, how can we do this? How can we do this in? Like the best way possible that takes the least amount of time and expense and you know, is the most like precise and clear and And makes good use of resources and is going to supply people with what they need. I would say my weaknesses part of it might be that I am not really confident in telling other people like what to do or like delegating duties and tasks. And so I think with this company being a traineeship it's a really good opportunity to learn more how to do that and how to sort of Manage everybody's own strengths and weaknesses to kind of pull the best out of everybody in the team and kind of make a cohesive, very strong unit, I think would be very beneficial because I do consider that a weakness, not really in the positions. I've had, I've either worked in a group or I've been a solo worker and like, independently just had to set my own. Own schedule and everything. So yeah, that definitely would be the strengths and weaknesses part."

Is that was a one that you know, I Sorry off on a tangent. I also think she would say that I was very loyal and like very caring person and they know that I'm also like I would say, we call it like high-strung, but I really like things to be like scheduled and decided we have a joke that I'm like the spreadsheet Queen because I make a lot of spreadsheets for personal use. So and so she definitely would kind of pick up on that organizational like this. I'm always on time I'm like consider it I'm always thinking of like how to be more like Hospitable. If you can use that as a term for like, just making a friendship easy for other people. And yeah, I think she'd say also that I'm pretty outgoing and That I like care about other people and pay attention to other people as well. So from the comments she's made in the past, that's I feel pretty sure of like how she would describe me."

I started off like in traffic infractions, and I ended up going over to small claims and civil and those things do kind of become a little bit repetitive once you do them for a few years. And so then I moved over to clerk of the court and that is something that does affect your status because you're in the courtroom You're talking with the judge or much more noticeable, mistakes and like good workmanship is also more noticeable and so that was like a definite learning curve. And there's other situations where I've been offered sort of inter-department even like promotions and some of those were like exciting. Because I knew that they were the right, the right thing they were forward momentum. that was like a good thing to happen in my life, personal career, other things made me a little bit more nervous like switching things and in the courts and I would say like that last Decision of being the clerk in court. Was a bad decision mainly because you see a lot of traumatic things in court and like some of those situations and stories of, like, in depth of like crime, and people being hurt and vulnerable, like, children being hurt that really stayed with me. So that was not a good decision. I can turn off like my emotions or my empathy in those situations but the other ones Is that were good decisions. And so you kind of have to live and learn and make the best decision for you, not necessarily for your status, or for the money, but for like, your soul, like, who you are as a person, and your own personal development"

Passively. I like to you know really kind of get to know the other person like a general overview of Of like how long they've been like at the company, maybe a little bit of family life likes and dislikes. Just so I get a sense of who they are and then also like their work style, that's can be like really important. There was one gal that other people kind of struggle to get along with. And I in my mind like she really exhibited a lot of the mannerisms So, someone who might be autistic, and so I just kind of went with that like don't touch anything on her desk or like, that's a problem. You know, she's going to hyper fixate and you just have to allow it to happen and you know, but other people had different different needs and so it was kind of about learning what those things were, as quickly as I could, I'd also like a pretty open person. I'm not very secretive. So I think that helps as well. And then just being very friendly, like, good morning, being a little bit persistent. I find that sometimes other people are standoffish around new people. They're not very welcoming and so sometimes you have to take the lead in doing that to make a connection and just kind of find your own Groove with in all of those personalities."

Is it unreasonable of me to like approach them and say, would you mind, you know, maybe not being so loud or something more tactful than that. Do you mind if this or that? Like but what if it's just their personality and they can't help it. That's it. Seems unfair for me to expect change in that kind of situation. And so, I more focus on myself and like, what I can do to deal with it. Like, is there a way around it? Like, some things are just like bad mannerisms. That's not like a hardcore personality trait. But other people, like, maybe they don't have the Short term memory or they can be, you know, very rarely like over overly talkative, you know, in a workplace or you're trying to focus and like some of those things you can say like, hey can you attacked a way for being, like, not be so distracting. And so it's just kind of I tend to take a lot of that on myself like that. I need to adjust to them. Unless it's something that That's actually feels like it's a bad behavior. It's like a deliberate thing and they can help it. Then I feel like it's something that probably needs to be addressed and depending on the situation and the severity of what it is. I might see if we can like mediate like with with a supervisor just to kind of help, kind of, not like to tell on them, but just to have like a objective in Tween person to mediate or I can just approach them directly if it's nothing. That's like a very big deal and just politely ask because sometimes they'll never know unless you tell them."

It was a desk job and my my boss at the time she was really good about kind of teaching me some lessons of like what's professional things, I didn't know. And so like that kind of correcting was so helpful and so one time she was like, you know, we don't leave our desks messy at the end of the day like we need to keep things kind Kind of organized because that's really professional again, it was a place where there was like some it needed needed to be professional and I was like, what? Oh yeah. So I always got into that habit of organizing everything at the end of the day because who knows maybe I might be sick or I might not be able to come in and someone's going to need to come in after me and like, figure out what things are where they are. So I tend to Label things even though I know where things are, I want other people to be aware like this is where I keep this. This is where I keep that just in case, you know, maybe I'm at lunch and someone calls and they need to find something. And I want to make that easy for them. And for me I don't like having a really messy desk, it kind of feels slovenly and so like it can get very disorganized through the days. I'm like working through things but at the end of the day gotta organize it makes. Sure, everything's good to go and I've kind of always practiced that."

When I get stuck, I can't seem to stop and go take a break and give my mind to rest. It doesn't do any good to keep trying the same solution over and over and over again. It's obviously not working my greatest strength I guess is that I tend to, Yeah, I don't know. I take my time and I have patience. I'm always on time, I always finish all my projects. I don't know."

I guess they would describe me as being someone who is caring and giving, and generous, and a little weird. Tends to be quiet. And tends to be kind of depressed. I quit drinking and all that kind of stuff, so they can't gripe about my drinking anymore. Yeah, that's about it. I don't know. Is there something else I'd like to add? What do my friends think of me? I don't know, there was ask how I'm doing. I don't know how to answer the question, I'm sorry."

I usually behave in these situations. Is the job I'm currently in. I continue to do the best job I can. And I don't tell anyone that I'm looking for a job. I keep it hush-hush until the day comes where I get a job offer. And then I tell my boss. Sorry, dude, later I'm done. Nice, knowing you. Why do you think that is? Why do I think what is Why is do I act that way? I don't know. Goes to run around and tell everybody I'm looking for a job. It means they're going to be looking for a way to fire me. So I'm not going to tell him. Yeah. Okay."

Because I'm afraid, if I say anything, I'm going to say something stupid. So I just don't say anything. I really don't like being in a room full of people. I don't really like people very much. No matter how much you do for them, they always screw you over. So I don't really deal with people. I have had to be on teams at work, I don't like it. I'd rather stay in my office and get things done remotely and not talk to anybody. Why do I think that is all sorts of mental illnesses? A rough life. I don't know. Just not digging it man. I'm much happier out here by myself avoiding people."

I would very much like to tell them to shut the hell up and let me work because they're being stupid, and they should leave me alone, but I can't do that because I'll get fired. So what I dinner generally do is just sit and wait for them to stop talking so that I can get back to work and just nod and smile and agree with whatever they say, no matter how stupid it is. And why do I think that is because I've got five hundred things I need to get done today. I've got work. That's going to take 24 hours and I've got eight hours to do it in. And my boss is keeping track of everything. I do, I don't know. Time to deal with your bowl. I just don't I'm working in one of the most stressful jobs on the planet and you're bugging me. So yeah, I try to just shut up and wait for them to calm down and go away."

But as soon as I get that project done all of its materials will be put away organized place in their proper spaces. And then I will move on to the next thing. Why do you think that is? The reason is as I go through each step, I have to lay out everything that I need to get done and while it may not look organized, it actually is it's not actual chaos. There's a reason I'm doing it this way and like I say once I'm done everything will get put away, it's not typical of me to be disorganized."

I have made that could affect my status. no matter how much money I make my social status is generally the same, Why do I think that is because of its situational barriers such as ableism and due to the Miss understanding that.

I think that is because I have practiced boundary work in the past and I'd rather not be annoyed by people."

So I think that some weaknesses I might have our that typically I can spend to too long on working on problem, but that's because I want to try and really understand what I'm working with before, I can tackle it, but I understand that sometimes. You must make very quick decisions especially when it's a timely manner. But I would say that some of my greatest strengths lie in my ability to create a list of steps that guide me towards my goal and a way to achieve those away to achieve that goal is to follow that routine that I'm used to. And I also think that I can work, well if I'm a part of 18 because with those goals in mind, I am. I understand? How to guide myself and I feel like, I understand how to guide people and that would work. Very well. As I take a leadership position in teams and guide them towards doing the overall goal that we all have to achieve for the company."

And I believe that those are very apt characteristics that I have, I tend to work well with others. I don't like to be rude. I like to account for many different things that could happen to people. And I understand that no matter who you are, you come from a different place. And I think that is very important. At that for people to be cooperating for them to understand that there must you have to have sympathy. You have to be a nice person. Additionally, I think that would describe me as generally more quiet and reassuring. So while I won't be at the Forefront, all the time of leading discussions, I will always be there and I understand that. A way to be there is not simply to be the main person the focus of attention but to also be the person that's just there at least for if you need to talk about anything. If you if you need somebody to bounce thoughts off of I'm there."
60e9031f16bbe7da0089ea25_q3_c1_1672704816_5c951bc8-d6f0-45d7-94f2-68fe39460400,"So generally with these kinds of situations, I think about it. Kind of, not really affecting my life because I understand that there are many ways for me to succeed in life and just because this could be a great way for me to get ahead in life and it could make my life even better than what it is. Now it's not the end, all be all. There is still my entire life ahead and money, isn't everything. So understanding that fundamentally no matter what. Amount of money I make, I will still be the same person is very important because when it comes to these decisions, I understand who I am, and what I want. And really I believe that it helps me just choose the correct decision when it comes to this. And I think that happens because a lot of times I try to not think about job about the salary. Rather how much I enjoy being there and doing the work because I can make as much money as possible. But if I dislike my job, if I don't, if I don't want to be there on a day-to-day basis, then really, I'm making money, but I'm not gaining anything in terms of happiness, in terms of Life, betterment, all that money would go to waste and I would have nothing else. Genuinely, I think it would be a waste of time to pursue a career that makes more money. If I don't think that would make me happy."

They don't understand who everybody is, and everybody's trying to find their place in the group. So I feel like by being outspoken or usually I am not, I will be able to vouch for myself. I'll be able to introduce myself to people and before they can make any assumptions about my work ethic or Or what I would do, as a part of the group, I am able to take that first step and meet them halfway in understanding our relationship. And I think that it is very I think that's because I tend to be more of a quiet person more shy, once we get products going because I try to focus on the project at hand, instead of trying to waste time and talk a lot about things that wouldn't necessarily help. I mean, I understand that planning would be very good but planning that leads to nowhere and planning that only prolongs no prolongs the amount of time that your you spend not doing anything and just idling is a waste of time."

I'm not going to do all these impulse reactions and deal with it in a way that I understand to deal with it. Because any rashly should decisions that I can make would be wrong, and I tend to be a more methodical person. So when I go through steps of how, to deal with something in the just in my daily life and goals in general, I go very slowly. So if I were to apply that to my social life and I appeal, I feel like that would be very beneficial for the outcome. And I think that's because quite frankly, Lee I've failed at doing that before and I have acted impulsively impulsively before and that has ruined my opportunity to be the bigger person and to possibly men, the relationship and be friends with that person."

Now that is because I tend to help from thing to thing. I try to be as productive as possible and that can that can result in me trying to compensate for all the work I should be doing. And it creates a messy workspace where although nobody else could walk in and understand what's going on. I understand where everything is. That is very different from. A common workspace, a common workspace. I probably wouldn't do that. I would try to keep things digital and even then it was still be very messy and disorganized but everything would have their own place in my mind at least and I think that's because I tend to be not scattered but go from thought to thought so quickly that I just write things down and I do them. Out of order and I try to get everything together, just kind of like a very general picture of what I'm trying to do first. And then from there, I can start to narrow down to very specific things. I want to do from each category that I've set up after I set up a general overview of what I'm trying to achieve."

I make sure that I complete everything thoroughly and generally, I get it done under time, but I'm not going to rush myself. I'm going to make sure that it was thoroughly done, and I'm going to make sure that it gets finished, whether with a team, or on my own. I always make sure that I have Helped people in regards to weaknesses. I would say that I do stress a little bit about perfectionism. I know, that's kind of like a go-to answer for people, but, um, I am very meticulous. So, it really, like bothers me and I will think about it often if I don't do it perfect. So I would say that's probably my greatest weakness."

Well, I would say loving probably, I just love people. I want to help people. I want to make the world a better place, and a lot of people think that means like some big gesture, but I think that is just, you know, showing your everyday person that they're important that they matter that they're Adhere so really just loving people. It can be as simple as holding the door and knowing that hey you're important enough for me to hold the door for giving them like you're at Aldi and you give them a cart because you already have a quarter anything like that just making sure that people in this world feel appreciated and know that there's someone out there that cares about them."

So I would just behave as normal. I would act myself, I would make the decision based on what I think would make me the happiest. And not, what would give me the most Financial benefit? I don't really want to make money my top thought or Feeling. So I kind of just set that aside and make sure that it's actually what will truly bring me happiness and not just, you know, some amount of money that eventually will most likely fade and my happiness won't be there."

Like, do they also have kids? You know, we have one. Do you have one? What's their ages? Did you get married young? Like I did, what's your favorite sport? What's your favorite TV? Show anything, I can kind of like get in common with them and then we can kind of start just talking like that. That. And then, I think that makes a professional relationship. A lot easier because you have kind of like a common Bond. Guess, I'm just very uncomfortable in new situations. So, when I can find a common ground, it kind of makes it where we have a talking point, and it's not just the new conversation, it's like, oh, hey, we agree on this, and we do this. So, let's see how we can kind of best work together to try to make this situation and work environment the best for us. Because everybody has different personalities. So, you want to make sure that you're like, not just being selfish and making sure that you work as a group effort,"

I would say that the quickest way is just to disrespect me and I would just point out, like, hey, I don't appreciate being talked to like this, let them know why and just let them know. That's not how I see the person. I'm going to be treated if you wouldn't treat other people like that. Don't treat me like that and so just kind of helping them realize what Happened. And why I hurt my feelings, I really just don't get annoyed at a lot of things though. I have a pretty good amount of patience when it comes to people. I try to think the best of people, but I really don't like when people are mean to me or disrespect me, and as long as they are doing it, like in a purposeful way, sometimes people just don't realize what they're saying, so in that case, I wouldn't even get upset but if they're purposely trying to her, Me, I would definitely just let them know. Hey, I don't appreciate this. Can we kinda tone it down a little bit?"

So, I quit my job. And I decided to go do a full career change and do home health care. And that was really intimidating for me because I had no prior experience, but I knew that it was going to be something that I would be passionate about and that I would be feeling fulfilled every day from doing and the pay was a lot better.

Is bothering me and or, yeah, but I think that most of the time, I either just kind of try to tolerate it to keep the peace, or just kind of brush it off or not, really, just try to let it affect me too much, and continue to do my job or live my life, or whatever it is."

I enjoy working with others, I'm very collaborative. I also am just open-minded and great at brainstorming and thinking of new ideas. That's something that I'm really passionate about. If I had to pick a weakness, something I've encountered in the past is that sometimes I really want things to be done, super accurately, And that can cause some difficulty with meeting deadlines. I've, I've come to the realization that relying on. Others is a great way to kind of help me through that. And also, like kind of live by the motto that it's better done than done period than done perfectly. But yeah, it's something that I am continually working on. I just really like doing high quality work, which I do think is a strength. But I think when I first Focus too much on that, it can become a little bit of a weakness."

I also am have a great sense of humor. That's something that's really important to me. I actually do improv comedy. So generally, I'm always trying to laugh and kind of make the best out of different situations and I tend to be optimistic as a result of that. I think they describe me as somebody who's really elevated. I tend to work hard and especially when I have a goal that I set I really like to achieve that goal. Usually if I set a goal I'm going to achieve it so I'm really driven in that way as well. I'm trying to think what else? Yeah somebody who just likes to have a fun time who Embraces New Opportunities and new challenges, who's always trying to kind of push herself to better herself.

I think I usually behave in situations the same way that I would. If there were a situation that didn't impact my status, I'm not necessarily motivated by those external factors. I'm more motivated by, you know, my own internal motivations. So, regardless of, if there's a decision that could impact my status or how much money I make, I'm going to work really hard. I'm going. To work to get along well, with others. I'm going to, you know, really try to achieve the best result that I can. And I think that just comes from like the way I was raised and kind of how I was as a child. Like I've always just been pretty self-motivated wanting to kind of achieve the best that I that I can in any given situation.

Generally, in these situations, I go in with humility and a true genuine desire to get to know the individuals on the team. I usually like to kind of feel out the environment first, and get a sense for, you know, what people's personalities are, like, what they're looking for in a co-worker, that kind of thing, and then I kind of assimilate the best that I can to that environment. Bayern meant I usually enter new situations with a sense of humor just because I think that's a great way to kind of break down barriers. And I think that's something why I think that is, as I learned that again from a really early age, that sense of humor is a great way to connect with other individuals. So I still use that today and have kind of always relied on that other than that, yeah, I always want to be somebody that can be relied upon Upon. So when I enter a new team I let people know you know that they can come to me with any concerns or questions and then I'm an open book and that way."

I think a great example of that is just driving in general. There's always it feels like every time I drive there's some sort of annoyance that comes up whether it's somebody cutting in front of me or tailgating me too closely or something like that, and I react in, you know, all sorts of different ways. In that situation, I do like to take a deep breath and kind of process. Us as best as I can. And then you know, I don't like to be, you know, retaliated retaliatory. So like honking or following them closely or something like that. So I just like to take a deep breath and kind of recenter myself and then move on with my day and kind of Let It Go as quickly as I can. I find if I like let the emotion wash over me the frustration feeling kind of sit with it for a second, then it goes away. And so that's what I what I prefer to do. Just kind of sit with it breathes and let it pass."

I would say that I have a system that works very well for me. But I think if an individual were to come into my workspace, for example, they might not understand the system that I have going. I am always working on like new organization methods. And I think, one thing that I that helps me a lot is Deke, Cluttering in general. So if I can get rid of the excess stuff, usually that helps me stay organized. And I think why that is is there's just a lot of priorities and in my life and I know in the lives of many other people. And so if I'm making a list of kind of my what my priorities are, it's always going to be, you know, working with students and working with faculty and working with other teachers, that's my priority and organizing just Falls a little bit lower on that list for me. But I do definitely have like a point where things get disorganized enough, like, that's going to become my new top priority for a while."

There was a project that was coming into fruition and so at one of the meetings, I was given an opportunity to speak on ideas or anything like that because that particular project that was being its Apparition also was going to be one of those things that Help the company overall. And I made a decision or I spoke about my particular idea, as far as what direction, the company could go in, with my particular idea and what particular way they could go about it. And my idea was one of those ideas that was considered, but I think it was in one of the top three choices that I heard and I unfortunately didn't get it. My idea to be chosen but it was a very big decision and they said that still my ended up being something that gets considered later down the line. If that particular option didn't work for that particular project they were investing in.

And so when I joined this new team of people, normally when I usually typically behave, when I enter a new team just becoming I'm really observant observant and really just thinking critically and keeping to myself to kind of pay attention to see how everybody reads the room or have a body tends to work together and just pay attention to see how the work culture and the team, everything is in a realistic and setting, you know, based on the interview of resume or the job description, basically, I can see how that is and I think It's what we do to just paying attention and overall just seeing how you act. So, that way, I can be able to act accordingly when I need to, in certain situations, when certain team members or management, may need me in certain situations or to be at certain places when I'm needed. And I think that's just overall a good thing that I typically do to assess the situation and a particular situation. Ocean or place or environment before stepping into something. So I know exactly how to act and react and provide Solutions if needed."

And to me, they came off is maybe standoffish or they came off his arrogant or very opinionated when we had certain conversation about how to take a particular problem or a situation that needed to be addressed, another particular team meeting or Meet up. And basically I was trying to State my opinion or my particular professional opinion and they weren't too fond of it and so they seem to like they were entitled or better than me. And that particular aspect when it came to giving it a professional opinion or advice. And so I just tended to just be quiet and you know shut down and just kind of wait and see how they react or talk it. Was somewhat annoying. Yes. But at the same time, I was thinking to myself, we'll just see how that plays out over time. You just never know. And so it was annoying, but I didn't, you know, showing my face that I was at know, what? I just in my head it was annoying but I didn't react or anything. I just said, okay, and I dressed them is okay. Sir or ma'am in that situation? Um, well, it was a male employee but I said I said, okay, I'm sorry and just move forward and just continue the meeting as we went along."
60f31196cf392939a843ab34_q6_c1_1672960359_e5358a77-bf8e-4856-a168-4f095a44c26e,"Also at this particular company there was a day where we visited a part of the work environment where it wasn't as organized as it could have been. And And we needed to work there for that particular space. And so, I basically just was a little confused but like I said, I was still pretty new at that time. I want to say a couple of weeks in and we haven't really been to that place much but there was one time where we went and it was a little color, a little not organized and that space we needed to use. So and it wasn't exactly my space to be using but at the time I think I was going to be using it. So basically I just organized and clean the space up. I didn't, you know Oh so more anything like that? Or wonder you know who left the space like that or anything like that. I just kind of continued my job and moved forward and just said, okay well it has to get done because I need that space to continue or do I work there? That was needed to be done that particular day and so that's pretty much it and that is pretty typical of me. I tend to just assess our situation and think but not obviously think aloud um, that might be accrued or offensive to some people or unprofessional. So Just kind of kept it to myself and was like, okay in the future, you know, maybe I need to address it to somebody or whatnot in the future, so that won't cause any other issues in the future. It may not be me, might be somebody else who might get offended or, you know, blast off or something like that. So, that is how I would particularly handle that situation. Just typically assessing anything ahead of time. And that's why I think that is"

I like working more than 40 hours a week, so obviously a company will like someone like me to be on board. You know, typically I like to listen to people. I don't like to talk over people. So I would be a great fit for a company simply because I like to listen to my co-workers, I don't think that I am the smartest person in the room there for Or you know, I'll take other people's opinions and ideas into consideration, my weakness. Okay, so one of my weaknesses generally I am shy. So I tend to not talk much, you know, like I said I'm usually a really good listener. So you know, I probably should give more ideas and meetings and stuff like that. I can't think of any other weaknesses."
60f4e3ab507bbb123f866e88_q2_c1_1671660867_8e05fae3-c761-454b-8126-7cb5e8a1d75d,"My best friend was described me as someone who's shy and introverted, I tend to keep to myself. And like I said, previously, I'm a good listener. So I'm my friends would describe me as someone who can listen to them, and, you know, not criticize them, and let them speak and, you know, speak their mind and stuff like that. Also, my friends would describe me as a hard worker. Like I said, I like to work over 40 hours a week. So, my friends would be like, oh she, you know, she's the type of person that will stay no two hours after work to get something done and my friends would describe me as Dependable, you know? Usually when I tell someone, I'm going to do something, I do it. You know, for example, if a friend asks me, hey, can I borrow $5? I'm going to give them the five dollars simply because I said I was going to give them the money, you know, I'm not gonna, you know, Change my mind about, you know, being loyal to someone so those you know my friends typically have positive attributes to say about me. So there you go."

For example, there have been times where I've left companies, okay. And I've lived the companies because you know another company offered me more money and usually what will happen is I'll ask for a raise and sometimes I don't get the raise. So you know. You know, unlike most people, I usually let the company know, you know, this other job offered me, this amount of money and I may leave. So sometimes, you know, they'll offer higher raise and sometimes they'll just be like well good luck. So usually this situation is I tend to be very intelligent in my decision-making. I don't make decisions based on emotion. I make decisions based on logic. And the reason why I behave like this is because I care about my future and I don't want to make any poor choices that will affect my future income."

So usually when I enter a new team I'm very humbled, you know I'm not arrogant because I know I'm in a new situation in the best thing I can do is be humble and and listen to people. So usually when I join a new group of people I'm usually just you know Hi how are you doing? You know tell me all that. You need to know especially if you know this is my obviously my first job at this company. I usually talk to people who are more More experience and I asked them. You know, what goes on this company? What should I know? So, the best way I could describe myself as I'm a great listener. So, you know, I usually, you know, I listen to people and, you know, I hope to give them great advice. And why I'm a good listener is because, you know, I'm an intelligent person, I know was better to listen to Just think, you know, everything So yeah."

And and that annoys me because it shows that you're not thinking critically about anything and you're just, you know, I don't know. You either want someone to talk to you. Or you know, you're just not intelligent person and you don't know how to research things and that that annoys me because I was an adult, you should already know how to do that. And, you know, usually in these situations, you know, when they people do those things, usually in the beginning, I give them the benefit of Doubt and I'm like, okay, well yeah, I'll give them multiple times to change your behavior, you know? And the reason why I do that is because I don't want to be judgmental and you know I try to understand people and you know why they behave the way they do."

So usually my workplace is very organized simply because I don't like to have a lot of files everywhere or documents everyone my best because that you know this tracks me so usually my desk is very organized. The times that it's not organized as because I'm extremely busy, doing something like, you know, if I'm, you know, seeing two out two hours after work and you know, it's chaotic then usually my desk may or may not be organized. Usually is, but the times it might be is, you know? And the reason why it's not because I'm very stressed. And I'm, you know, the last thing on my mind, it's my desk being organized and focused on the task at hand and what I need to accomplish. But that is, you know, Uncommon for me. Let's see here. Yeah, that's pretty much it."

It was my greatest strength. The weaknesses are I don't know. I'm old for this position and I think that a lot of people would not just more of an entry level position, and I think I would not be Very appropriate for this. Other than that, I tend to be very focused and sometimes I will work. Extra hours, and sometimes I'm too focused to communicate as well as I should with others."

So he counted codes guide me as very competent and very intelligent and knowledgeable. We are old Buddies. It's not huge, it's probably say it comfortable guy to be with and you know I pick up the check more often than not so he likes me that way."

I'm not really into status, or lot of money. I assume that if I do a good job, I will be compensated properly and inspected. So why decision is just to do as good? A job as I can, I don't spend a lot of time promoting myself like this. Why actions? Speak for themselves but I have done things where I have had the words reviews and I always stand up for myself and say look this is what I did and there were once or twice, I've had to talk to people about, you know, the future of my job. And I've always been very felt work, right about it. But I'm not someone who actually, which is why self. Because, status and money isn't that important?"

I heard, you know, I did be outgoing and reduce myself to the group but then I like to go one-on-one with each person to see you know who they are and how they are. Because I need to you know, evaluate them and know what their strengths and weaknesses are because I'll be working with them. And I came to take over and direct things. So I need to know what they can do when I can get from them, or what they can give help me with. It's more of a professional professionally trying to Connect with the verses. You know we go by your sculpture or a beer type of thing. And that's because I am not really that interested in having more friends at from work. I just want people who work with and a one has a decent environment."

But with my personal life, someone annoys me, I tend to avoid them and make it. So that the situations that I'm in the only, clued them, or don't bring up controversial subjects, where they would annoy me at work, actually will harder because You suck working with these people and I am not into confronting. I do not want to have constructive confrontation relationship with someone. But if it gets bad, I would probably take him aside and say you know, this is not productive in this in this work bait place and they'll even continues, I might go to the person's supervisor, each a, you get this person to lighten up of it."

My work is always built very well organized on time. Well, very well documented. My workspace on the other hand, it's just clutter stuff around notes everywhere. I've got stuff that I can pick up and play around with And everywhere add to taper. So I find that to be creative like the Clutter and stuff, and I'm not some, one of the clean desk, but my work itself is, it's always very, very professional. And well, documented, well commented, not sloppy in any way."

These are, these are my strengths and I like to do a thorough job and I really like to make sure I'm doing the job, right? And oftentimes, I'll I like to get clarity in my instructions when I'm doing a job and I like to, I also like to do things on time, but I think I think one of my strengths is that I'd rather do a thorough job and maybe take a little bit more time because I found that for myself, and for other people that You don't do it thorough job. The first time you end up, doing end up redoing the job. So, it ends up taking longer over the over the long term. It, there were more errors. So, I mean, that kind of ties into my weakness. I think, I tend to, because I tend to be more thorough, sometimes it can be seen as being too slow, but I think that in reality that, also is my strength, because Like I said, it I into as time goes on, I get faster and more accurate and I think it is better to be more accurate within reason. I think, you know, when I first started job, my weakness is that I tend to be too slow, but Oftentimes, as I progress in the job, I end up being faster and accurate at that job. So I think those yeah, that I think those are my strengths and weaknesses."

I'm not as reserved as they think. And I think they would also describe me as somebody who helps other others out. And I do that, I end up doing that quite a bit. I think most of the time when people ask me for favors I just do them without thinking and I think I think typically I tend to just do things when people ask and that's maybe not always a good thing but I think four friends I think that that's that's a good quality for them. And I think they know, I could be trusted and relied on 11. They really need something. So I think that that's some good qualities. I also think that my friends would describe me as somebody who Maybe thanks a little bit more about certain things. I'm not. I'm not the type who judges things on first glance. So I tend to when I learn about something, I don't just take things at face value. I tend to look more deeply into things and I think my friends also describe me as somebody who has a fairly wide degree interests in subject matters. I maybe not. like the type of person who would be into partying or extreme sports or anything like that. But as far as intellectual Pursuits, I think they would describe me as having wide a wide degree of interests."

I think, That people appreciated those, those qualities of being thorough and typically management. Really appreciated that because it seems like more often than not. There were a lot of people who were in different jobs, who would just do cursory things and not do a thorough job. And I think most people want somebody, they can count on to do a job and think thoroughly about that job. So, you know, is taking on a leadership role. In projects, training employees and then trying to do a thorough job. I think those were the things that made mainly employers looked looked for and appreciate it in me."

And no number good with names. So I usually I often times had to remember, had them tell me their names again, but the thing I tried to identify was the person who could teach me the most in the situation, and, and whom I could learn from Acme, count on to get good answers. so, typically, I would talk to that person and Seek out. The person had the most information and then because, you know, because it's a job and, you know, I have to do the job and then I would try and probably find out, you know, an alternate person. The person who had the next most amount of information. And next person who I could count on, So and after I got cut more comfortable in the job, I would probably interact with more people and that would take some more time because my priority was doing the job correctly. And after I got feeling really comfortable with the job, I would probably interact with people more and, you know, joke around and more socialized with those people. But, you know, my priority was always to get the job done. And to be able to do it adequately and proficiently. So like I said, though, the my most important thing was to be up to do the job, right?"

You can't, you can't avoid that person. So, I guess, typically, when I would interact with people who had, no, I'd me, I would just try and Have the minimum amount of interaction I could with them and try and be as polite as I could. and just Basically just try and get them off my back, you know. So I could do my job and you know, I would never in a professional situation, I would never try to get snarky or nasty with those people, but I might try and avoid them a little bit in the work situation and just just do the bare minimum. So I think generally, I would just try to avoid those people and in my personal life, if there was somebody who annoy me, I might be a little bit more vocal with them as time went on or, you know, if it was somebody I could just avoid altogether in my personal life. I would just avoid it because there's no sense being around somebody who's annoying in your personal life, because you usually have control over here your personal life, the exception being with family, you know, if there's somebody in your family and they annoy you, you probably because their family and you're a little bit more, you can be a little bit more open with them. You might I might show my annoyance a little bit more with those people and in family situations, I might try and involve other family members not to argue but just to kind of soften the blow of being around that person. so, I mean, I think that if a person got bad enough about being annoying, You know, in a work situation I would probably if it were were a more minor annoyance. I might address them directly. If it were a more major thing, I probably would go to my supervisor supervisor or employer, boss, whoever and say, hey this person, they're being annoying annoying, and it's affecting my productivity. And if it were somebody in my personal life, I probably would be more direct and just, you know, if I couldn't avoid them, I would be more direct."

I would just keep it organized because that's that's the most productive way to get things done. What's ironic is that sometimes if you know, I'm not very busy, my my workspace would actually get more disorganized.

And I also am able to learn new skills quickly, for example, I taught myself a couple of new programming languages over the summer and I really believe in my ability to just use Google or YouTube to find tutorials and I can really learn any new skill quickly in the context of management. In the past, I have worked at a couple of doggy day cares where the boss has been able to teach me how to Do things and I pick it up very quickly. My greatest weaknesses as an employee is. I would say that sometimes I don't like asking for help, sometimes I believe in my ability to figure things out on my own a little too much. So then the result is I am a little bit hesitant to ask authority figures for help because I think I can just figure it out myself. And I would say that's a weakness for me. Because it can make me a little bit slower, and I can develop my own methods, which might not always be the most efficient."

Generally speaking, I'm usually the one that is trying to forsee any possible like issues with any plans that were making and sometimes I tend to micromanage a little bit. So I guess my friends would describe me as responsible. I would also think that my best friend would describe me as funny. You know, I like to bake jokes and I think that my friends would also just described me as a fun person. I think that I'm fun to be around and I like coming up with activities for us to do so yeah. Generally speaking, I think my friends would see that I both have this very responsible side and that I also know how to be fun as well."

As I am, a current college student and all of my previous work experience, was just kind of with, like, minimum wage jobs, where there isn't as much room for improvement. So I would say that I've kind of Switched Majors during college, but originally, my goal was to just study something that I found really interesting regardless of what my future salary would be. So I was a physics major because I just thought that physics was really interesting and I knew that kind of only career path for that would be to either become a high school teacher or a professor. And then I pivoted and switched to being like a data science major, which has a more definite career path. And A more direct path to having a job with a higher salary, more quickly as opposed to having to obtain a PhD first. As was the case for physics. So, due to that choice, I would say that. I usually, I would say that I would care more about how much money I would make than necessarily my status. I think that's just kind of a necessity in today's economy is to care about how much money you make, but But I also care about how much money other people make. I would say generally that if I was a manager, I would want all of the employees to be paid as highly as possible. I firmly believe in the principle of reducing the pay of the people, at the tops of the people at the bottom can make more money. So that is a decision that I would potentially make as a manager that could affect how much money I make."

So, for example, I joined a research group for this past summer and I kind of was He's able to do both of these things. Since I was rather inexperienced I needed to just like get my work done and really learn how to attack more work. So I was trying to be very productive and was always like, asking for help asking for what other tasks. I could get started on and then on the flip side like during group meetings or breaks, I was also trying to get to know everyone and include everyone and Crack jokes or whatever. And I think I was successfully able to befriend the group. So I would say that in general, I tend to both be hard-working and productive when I first joined a group so that I can kind of prove myself and get established within that team. But then I also try to be fun and befriend everyone on that team."

And that's because that is the right thing to do. I think most of the times when someone is being annoying or annoying, me, they probably just don't Eyes or they have some sort of like me that they need to fulfill. So they're nagging me about it. So the right thing to do is to still just be positive, be polite, and kind to them, and hopefully help them resolve their goal that is resulting in them annoying me."

Was when I was working at a Doggy Daycare in high school, because we used paper pencil to keep track of everything for our clients, as opposed to keeping it on a computer. So we just had lots of cards and papers everywhere, all over the front desk, and it wasn't very organized. I mean, some of the other younger employees did try to organize it At some point. So I would say that having an unorganized workspace. It's not necessarily typical of me. I like to keep my things at least somewhat organized. Sometimes, I'm not the most organized person, but at least I always know where everything is. So that works for me and I would just think that being organized in generals because I'm kind of a conscientious person and it's always good to know where everything is. So yeah."

And also line level of compassion is impeccable. It's really comparable to the majority of the average person. You know, so I'm always willing to help someone out, I'm always willing to take things, a step further, and I'm also willing to go above and beyond, but now, one of my weaknesses is, I don't like asking for help. So if I'm struggling, I tried to tend to make mistakes and learn how to do the job myself. Even though I should be asking for assistance at a certain time, especially when I'm struggling. So that's one of my biggest weaknesses on a job. And also another strength is on Vance - and another one of my weaknesses is. I don't like I tend to kind of Rush and hurry up and try to solve the problem versus trying to take my time."

First of all, secondly, he will also describe me as a person who is simply blunt and honest. but compassion alone, you know, like I said, I'm not a mean individual but at the same time, I'm not a pushover either. So what's right is right? And what's wrong, what's wrong? What's fair is fair. So that's would be the perfect way that my best friend would explain me to you all. You know, it's just a somewhat National individual but account last night, individual, you know, the type of person that would give away the shirt off my back to someone who needs it. and also the type of person that called out any form of wrongdoing, any form of fashion, so, oh, and my best friend would also tell me that effectuated with improvements.

Occasion for my previous job, actually on well, Around this time, a lot of people would quit. Because of bad work morale along with - work ethic and I'm the type of person. I try my best to stick it out for as long as I can. So that being said, you know, my survival often, leave a promotion, because we're going on regional manager, but I didn't want it because of the fact that I know this position is way more stressful and the extra money is just simply not worth it, especially, Really, when you are ready, you know, have a another legal side, hustle online or something of that nature. But anyway, long story short. That's part of the reason why I no longer have been place because after that my supervisor got very upset with me and he moved me to a position that I was way overqualified for. And he had me actually try to train someone to replace a job after rejecting a promotion. So eventually I put in my two weeks notice and I left So I have been allies for not accepting a position that I did not walks in the form of a motion."

I try to give each and every team member that I will be working with the benefit of the doubt in the beginning. Unless they, of course, give me a reason not to give them, or allow them to have the benefit of the doubt from the beginning. So, Usually usually I'm just kind of quiet, you know, in the beginning, to try to get to know each team member and their characteristics. You know, whether they are timid aggressive passive, or we're not going after that. That's how I know to act. According it helps me be to be able to act accordingly and make adjustments. So things can remain peaceful and smoothly, especially when the young Lieutenant because first impression is everything, you know, you always want to make a good first impression for the bad first, impression can set the whole tone of the entire time that you're working at this particular place.

That's just one pet peeve I just really can't stand with people not washing their hands and they use the restroom Now, another situation is, when I see this all the times, when people tend to act arrogant and make others feel bad, just to stroke their own egos, I don't like that either because I feel like anybody can be humbled at any given time, you know, maybe Rich today and what, a more anything can happen. So, the same people that you see coming up on the way to the top of the same people that you will run across on the way out of that. That. So, and another situation is, When?

Maintenance man did not want to fix these machines. It got to the point they were looking at us to fix the problems that they were getting paid to fix. Why they were being lazy and sitting on their behinds in the break room. Wow, I'm out here struggling. Trying to figure out what's wrong with this machine now, only good thing that came out of that situation is I learned a few things on my own on that particular job because of the disorganization problem that they were having. And no, that was not normal. That's not typical to most places. Are normally extremely organized with this private company. In particular just seem to have a problem with organization and competence pretty much. So and I honestly believe that corruption has a role to play in that because there's no way that other companies and other locations of the same name, in the same company can have updated equipment in this particular place. So at that point, that's more on the management for management and not the employees themselves. So, no, that's not it."

So instead of framing an issue, As a problem, I prefer to frame it in a way where it is a learning experience or just a safe place to to share things that everyone thinks can be improved.

I'll do what I need to do to make sure that I reach all the goals that I have set for myself. One of the weaknesses that I would say I have is probably not taking a lot of risk. I'm not someone who likes to put myself out there too much or put too much on the line, because I tend to have a lot of anxiety, and I tend to have a lot of stress and fear at what could happen if things go wrong.

I once I feel a connection to you, I will do my best to make sure that I am the best friend that I can be. I'm a person that likes to give a lot to my friends.

I do try to make my self aware enough to, you know, go out of my way to smile and make it seem like I'm open to meeting new people, where it seems like I'm friendly and people can come up to me. Like I said, a lot of the reasons why I tend to be more quiet and not go up to people. I don't enjoy being the center of attention. I have too much anxiety for that to be something to ever happen. So I tend to kind of just sit back and observe what's going on. And I allow people to come up to me to start those conversations."

If or you know, if it was something Saying that kept repeatedly happening, it was someone who wouldn't let up, then I would confront the situation head-on, but if it was just someone who was talking to me and I found them to be very vain or I found them to be funny. Not be funny than, like I said, it would probably just be me offering them in a fake smile and then an excuse to remove myself from the situation. So I wouldn't have to deal with that person anymore. Again, I know that it wouldn't be something where I would try to make a scene or anything like that because I don't enjoy being the center of attention and I would find that to be very embarrassing.

But if I'm not knowledgeable about something, and someone else is definitely more in tune to answer something or to teach somebody something. I'm more than happy to take a back seat and let them kind of do it. And then one of my greatest weaknesses is that I definitely need to learn how to have a better work-life balance. I generally tend to have always had my mind on always have my brain on especially since I'm such a creative person. Even I could lie in bed at 3 a.m. and wake up and think of an idea for work.

I'm Gemini generally, the one that they go to, for advice, but also kind of like the comic relief. My life is very crazy. I have so many different stories to tell people. So, I typically am the person that my friends are like, Lexie, like what happened this weekend and I have this whole elaborate Story about some crazy thing that happened. I mean, or if the Vibes kind of down something, sad happened, I'm kind of the one that kind of picked people up and come be like, hey, let's go do something. Let's have fun. Let's go, get drinks. Let's go watch a movie. Anything like that, I definitely don't like people to use sad and kind of down.

Actually, I had a very pretty good job. I was top of the sales, I had a great workplace. I love the people that I worked with, but it was just not something that I want to do full term. And so I kind of took a risk and I had to leave that job because I want to do an internship about one state away. I live in Georgia and I went to Myrtle Beach South Carolina for the summer and did an internship. That's not pay as well was more hours, more work but it was something that I wanted to do and it would increase my ability to do things. I would learn a lot. I would just have so much exposure and it was something that I really want to. To do and so I did it. And of course, the money was not as good, but the amount of things that I learned in the education that I got from, that was absolutely. Extraordinary. And I would not be where I was if I didn't take that risk. And so I'm really glad that I did because it's definitely paid off in the long run."

So, a new job, I might be a little more passive but after a while my shell comes Soph and people see the real me where I'm comic relief like I said, or just really extroverted, but if I'm with a group of people that are around my age that maybe I have a common interest with them. I feel like I'm definitely more extroverted and I would get to know them and kind of lead the conversations more but it really just depends on who they are.

It's not that person's fault. It's kind of my fault that I am annoyed with them. They're just doing their best or not being intentional. Most of the time. I don't think anyone really intends to be annoying. So I kind of keep it to myself and kind of realize. This is just me. They're not doing it intentionally. Lee, they're just trying, their best, whatever the case may be. And so I think I just kind of tend to keep it to myself. Tend to maybe shut down a little bit in the situation and not react as much to them in regards of if they're talking to me. I might be a little shorter. I might not pay as much attention, but I definitely don't let them know that they've been or me or anything like that because I know how terrible that can be I've been on. That side where someone's told me I was annoying once and it definitely hurt my feelings and I never want anyone to feel like that."

Very on top of things or you can come in one day and realize that you have to post five things within that hour and you're freaking out and it's cluttered and you're just trying to push through the hour. So I'm not. I'm very used to having those situations so they don't really mess with me a lot but I do like to have things organized personally, If something's not personal. If something's not organized though, it doesn't typically bother me unless it's something that can be straightened out. Be organized, really quickly. I just do it to the side. But my desk tends to be very organized, but my head and the things that I'm doing tend to not be organized, but it's worth it."

I'm also very empathetic and good, it picking up on kind of the ways that others are feeling. Being and helping by responding in accordance with how others are feeling also.

I do anything in my power to get those things done. I think she would say that I'm caring toward others and eager to help others out in any way that they're needing and that I tried it.

I want to make sure that I have all the information and all the details that I need to make an informed decision weigh the pros and cons of different options that I have. So that I feel like I can make a really informed Choice. Even though these kinds of decisions are situations can be stressful and there's a lot of Pressure link to that, I want to take a deep breath and try to be as objective as I can and weigh all the options and really make sure that my decision is fully informed by all the information that I can get."

And and why that is, if it's in like a professional setting or a setting may be where I'm not as familiar, or comfortable with the people around me, then I'm probably more likely to try to decide like, okay, is this annoyance of a battle that I really want to pick or do I want to let it go and move on? And so again it just kind of depends on the context but in a work atmosphere, are more likely to probably be if it's not a big deal to just let it go and move on."

I really need order and to know where things are, otherwise that causes stress for me, if I'm looking for something, and I'm not exactly sure where it is. So I make a strong effort in my workspace in my office to make sure that everything has a place, and the throughout the day, at the very least, the end of the day, the thing. Things go where they're supposed to so that I can find those things later and that's a skill of I've definitely honed over time because I've learned from prior mistakes that if things aren't organized that it's harder for me to find what I need and then that's going to cause me unnecessary stress. So at this point, I think I'm very organized in my work environment."

I'm really grateful that in my position, we have electronic notebooks and kind of like electronic organization system. So like everything is in folders. where it needs to be and that's been really useful so it's not typical anymore just because I have created a system of organization that's easy for me to follow before when I was more prevalent as I said it was a lot of it had to do with the fact that I was taking on too many tasks and then I couldn't keep them all straight or when they were do or what I was working on with which one And so that that is where I feel like there was a lot of confusion.

I also make it a point to ask my co-workers or members of this new team personal and for personal questions and kind of get to know them on a personal level. Well, I think other people think of you more positively, when you are interested in there in themselves and people like, to talk about themselves.

If there's other people that I feel like are more competent, or more qualified at that, but I do like to get the ball rolling on the right foot and I know I'm capable of doing that.

Not that I would. Of completely avoid the person, I don't think that's ever successful but I tend to avoid just the situation in general. I don't like creating confrontation or someone annoys me also. It's usually a personal problem and not something. The other person has any idea that they're doing. So I just don't really confront it with them because it's a me problem and I think that's because I do tend to get annoyed with people for things that are that's us. Side of their control. So, but I also recognize that so I don't want to cause problems, and I also don't want to create an uncomfortable work environment. So I do tend to just, you know, avoid the issue.

Again, if it's a personality thing for the person and it's just something that the people the community doesn't really like. That's one thing you can't really do anything about that and you just have to work through it and you have to work with the person anyway. But if it's, you know, a bigger issue if it's an actual Behavior issue, that's when I begin to stand up for people, other people that are affected by it. I don't really ever put myself first in those situations. Because I feel like if you're talking about just yourself, it could become a self-centered argument. But when you're talking about a group of people being annoyed for good reason, that's when I feel like I have to stand up for these people, and I have to take this position of standing up for them. And so that's what I do. So, you know, if it's one person and I'm just annoyed by them, nothing really happens and I keep working. And if it's a group, I depends."

When I'm thinking, my brain thinks a little bit all over the place and there's bursts of energy and everything always gets completed for me, like, always, it's I've never had an issue with having disorganized work just to disorganize space. And that's proven successful for me so I don't really feel like I need to change it. I do like having an organized space and I like starting with an organized space and you know, cleaning up every once in a while. So I do clean up, but it's not vital for me to complete my work.

Usually you're able to identify your strengths, if you look internally reflect on your own skills and your own mindset and your own behaviors. But if you don't have those qualities, sometimes you take on the strengths and weaknesses that others have presented to you. My greatest strength, I would say. Say from generally looking at in word is understanding My Own Strength, I guess. So being reflective being able to take criticism well and being able to improve and provide quality behavioral skills and quality program improvements depending on my own expertise. But also, knowing that I am not an expert in everything. So being able to understand that, if I'm not an expert in everything is like the best thing. For you to know.

Everyone can see different perspectives on a problem and that's why you need to work with those people, of course. There's always going to be a few people who want to be the leader, or the people who don't who want to fade in the background. I would say, I'm more in the neutral middle ground because I want to work with the leaders and those who fate, I think it's important that we all were Work together as a way to solve any problem or situation.

So, Oh, yeah, there will be people who annoy you, and there will be people who make you frustrated, especially when it comes to subordinates or bosses or even supervisors. I think it's better to think of ways to problem-solve, rather than to react, if you always react to annoying situations, you're going to be the person who those people are people in general would not want to work with.

They weren't my supervisor and they weren't, they were not my boss, but they were acting as if they were. I think that was probably because they knew that they had more experience on the job. So they kept telling me what to do how to do it pointing out everything that I was making a mistake on and I don't think I would have minded that very much. at that they came across as kind of like demanding and kind of like Kind of impatient, which I think was unfair, because I was a new employee at the place."

I didn't have time to tidy up after working on one thing, putting something down to work on something else. But that wasn't that's not a very typical thing that I usually go through. Usually I'm very organized and I keep my things. In order where I know where each thing is, where I could usually easily reach for."

I generally work very well with others. I enjoy collaborating on different issues or problems. I also take my work very seriously. I'm motivated to do a good job and that helps me to remain focused on what needs to happen. My greatest weakness might be some senses of perfection and I like to do a good job. I like anything that has my name on it to be something that is high quality work. So I sometimes have had a tendency to over manage other people. I'm working with something. I have worked on in the past. However, I do believe that my willingness to work through things is a great strength."

I believe that I am generally someone who enjoys being with other people enjoys listening and making sure that our relationship is mutual reciprocal, making sure that I am responding to their needs and their interest. I enjoy taking advantage of situations and having fun. One with others either. Something that they like to do or the I like to do.

I would take in my career that would affect how much money I would make. I usually behave in a way of reflection and looking at what do I actually want with my life? Making procon lists looking at? Is this decision really decision that would make bring me joy. Bring me purpose in life, land me in a job or career. That would be a place where I could be motivated. Be Inspired work with good people or am I making the decision purely based on that status or money that it might make? So I do believe I have made the right path decisions based on those situations and more looking at overall quality of life rather than outwardly what may look like great quality of life in terms of money or status."

I do believe it's very important to get a handle on the Dynamics of the team. What is expected of me before jumping in and making assumptions? I think it's also good to establish a baseline of collaborative relationship with other members of the team. So that That we can move forward working. Well it is often hard. I think to invite a new person to join your team. So I'm often thinking about how they're feeling about my presence. There is something that they are excited about something. There are a little nervous or worried about and how I can work in that and, you know, settle any worries or fears that they may have. I do think a lot of this stems from my interest in working. Well with people, I prefer to work on a team that communicates well, collaborates well together. So I think that by By stepping back and making sure that I can fit myself into the team. Appropriately is kind of my number one priority. When I am joining a new team."

I definitely take time to reflect on my own emotional reaction. Why have I been annoyed? Is it something specifically with this situation specifically with this person or is there something bigger than the situation that has caused my emotions to be a little bit more - going into the Ian and I'm placing more impact on their reactions or actions or behaviors than is appropriate. I think I often Retreat to think about the situation a little bit further. And then based on that don't function, is something that does need to be addressed. Is this something that was really something that can be moved on and maybe a dress differently in the future? Then I based on that is what I do moving forward. I think that that is because I am Aware that emotions can be a little bit finicky and a lot of it is based on more than just what's happening surface level. So I think that it's important really to get to the core of something before addressing it because you might be bringing in additional things that might not be appropriate to be addressed or might not need to be addressed. Also understanding the other person's perspective in that situation is really critical to making a good decision moving forward. If you understand, where they're coming from lot of times that can diminish your own anger or frustration. When you see that they might be having similar feelings for another reason."

However, this does not happen very often I prefer, you know where everything is so that I can be more efficient with my time. I enjoy setting up a routine and procedures for different different procedures that happen during the workday. So that I become more efficient, more competent. I'm able to move through tasks quickly and I think that is because I like, Like being very efficient, I like moving quickly at work, especially things that are more routine, and don't require a lot of mental load. So I think that having everything where it needs to be and having my to-do lists and my files, everything organized knowing where it is having spreadsheets. All those things are very valuable to me, and my own organization and my own stress levels, being able to know, you know, there's a procedure. There's something to do and I have the control over that."

I think that I'm pretty flexible and I am willing to relocate or change my responsibilities in a job or anything because I'm always willing to have new experiences and learn new skills. So I think that that would be one of my greatest strengths and as for a weakness, I think that I could I tend to focus on the details a lot. I think that I when I'm really passionate about something I really want things to work out and when they You I kind of get a little bit like shaken up because I am very goal-oriented and when I'm following a specific way of work and then it kind of goes off the plan then I get a little discouraged but generally I'm able to work past it and working in a team. And with others, I kind of learn how to do. What this kind of thing. So I think that overall focusing a lot on the details is something that I can definitely work on, but it's something that is fixable and something that I'm working towards."

I think that this is one of the main qualities that they would try to focus on and trying to describe me. I think that they know that kindness and empathy is something that I really value. And it's something that I really try to and body and try to give off on an everyday basis, whether that be with them or just with strangers, I think that this is one of my foundations in life that I really try to use and live by on a daily basis because not only does it make me happy but it also makes others happy if people are kind. It's kind of a basic quality, but it's something that I feel like a lot of people can just kind of Take it as a given but I think it's something that we don't really live by. So I think that that's definitely one main quality and I think that they would say that. I'm also really good listener. I think that they they know how much I care about what people say and how much I love hearing people's stories. And they know that it doesn't just go in One ear and out the other. They know that like people stories and what people are saying really means a lot to me, no matter who it is. So I think that's another thing that they would describe me as and yeah that's pretty much it."

And I think that within this opportunity, I would choose to really put myself out there because typically I would say that I'm an introvert. Vert and kind of keep to myself. So I think that I really put myself out there by talking to all my co-workers and supervisors and getting to know people in other fields within the business. So I think this was one of my main strategies. I think that I also I'd typically put all of my work into what I'm doing and all my effort. But in this job particularly, I think that I really tried to push myself to a degree that was typically outside of my comfort zone. So I really wanted to show my bosses that I was passionate about the work and I was willing to put in more than they ask for, because I knew that if I did put that much in, then eventually I would be rewarded for that. And it gave me incentive in the future as well. Because I realized that if I did do that much, then eventually I would reach a higher status within the company that I was working for. So I think that these few strategies really did help me build my reputation and my status overall,"
60ff7e913a2ea98fff1d0cf3_q4_c1_1671762864_7dbf8e27-de97-4dde-adc0-4a14c67950ec,"So, I think that I, when I usually join a new team, a new team of people. I tend to be on the quiet side. I kind of observe what the dynamic is like between co-workers and between supervisors and managers, and all that before I really get comfortable with talking to people and kind of setting myself in that position, And I think this is typically out of kind of like an old-fashioned way of thinking, just out of respect for old, like, people who have been there for a longer amount of time. I think that, I tend to be the type of person who likes to, I'm typically easygoing and I want people to feel like they're their status is not threatened by my position. In the work. So I kind of let things go and I go with the flow and I do what I'm told. So I think this is how I typically act when I first enter new team and eventually with time I start becoming more comfortable as I gained new relationships. And I start really knowing what my responsibilities are in this field of work. And I think that, That I kind of grow into the role and especially when there's new people who come into the team. After me, I really try to act as a role model and kind of welcomed them in because that's what I would want as well, when joining a team. So, I think that those are kind of the ways that I maneuver, when I am put into a new team,"
60ff7e913a2ea98fff1d0cf3_q5_c1_1671763010_7dbf8e27-de97-4dde-adc0-4a14c67950ec,"So I think that when I'm typically annoyed, I usually is caused by someone doing something, either repetitively, or something that I kind of dislike in like a personality. And I think that when I do get annoyed by someone, I typically try to remove myself from the situation. So I think that if it's not someone's fault and if it's something that is kind of something that just bothers me and isn't really typically considered like annoying. I think that it's my responsibility to leave a situation because that's just something that I have to deal with and something I have to work through, but if it's something that I Three with fundamentally. And if someone's doing something that I just think would be better if it wasn't happening. Then I would probably try to have a conversation with the person. I think that these kinds of scenarios are perfect ways of like having an open discussion and kind of trying to change someone's ways. If it is kind of harmful which isn't usually the Case when someone is annoying me, but if it is then it's a, it's a good learning experience for both of us. And it also allows me to kind of get my feelings out versus keeping them internalized. So yeah, I think that typically, I just try to leave the situation because that's just how I am. But overall yeah that it pretty much works out."

I get kind of flustered so I think as soon as I see things start building up, I really try to just Clear my space and just organize my head, because I think kind of a disorganized workspace also creates a disorganized mind as for, just, for me personally. So, as soon as I see things building up, I really try to just organize things back to just get myself more, relaxed, and ready to work. And I think, That also using a planner is something that I also really value because to me, it's really satisfying to write all of my tasks down and to check off things that I've done already, because it really helps me. Keep, keep it organized and just know where I'm at and what I'm supposed to do. Whether that be short term, or long term. But yeah, this is something that I really cherish and something that I really try to stay on top of because I think my brain kind of gets over 1 quickly, if things aren't organized. So yeah, I really tend to be pretty on top of my things in regard to my workspace."

My greatest strengths would be my ability to follow instructions and learn quickly. My determination and competitive nature so I feel like whatever the job may be out of the task, maybe I would look at it more as a competition. In which I need to advance and succeed in and win. So, I'll take that very seriously and whatever it takes to get the job done. The right way is what I'm going to do weaknesses, you know, I probably would say maybe wanting to do things correctly.

I went from being an employee to being a business owner. I went from having a steady paycheck to be responsible for making my own money and for every facet of the business, Now you know how I behave and that type of situation is again, just being very competitive and doing what it takes to get the job done. And at this point, you know, in that situation that applied to everything. So you know why that is, is because generally, I'm a competitive person, I grew up playing sports, which, you know, made me want to. When succeed train and do what it takes to be successful."

So usually how I behave is that you know get to know everyone on the team. You know, we discussed what the goal is and see what our strengths and weaknesses may be. Legate, you know work and, you know, find out what is exactly is going to take from us individually to be successful as a team and make it known that we were there to support each other.

And why and why that is something that Needs to be done calmly, you know with respect and you know, just have that person see it from my angle and and usually you know that will do the trick. So yeah, I mean it's not something that I'm just going to let you know stew for a long period of time. You know, I'll take the necessary steps to initiate a conversation. With that person and and we'll get it, worked out."

It may take an extra few seconds here are there but it pays off in the long run. Organization in every way will actually pay off. So, you know, just discipline myself to do that.

To best help the company or the the group, some of the weaknesses. I'm not incredibly assertive do well in leadership positions. But in a situation where I need to get on to somebody, if they're not doing what they need to be doing, it is difficult for me to kind of pass that line of going from a friend to be more aggressive and assertive and pushing that person too.

So maybe taking a career path today would make you more money, but it's not going to set you down the path. That will be best for you financially. Ali and status, you know whatever metric you want to measure it by. So I think I'd like to have a long-term approach. I usually behave in a long-term oriented decision making process where I look at that career path but it would lead to what it would require of me. How that would affect my family. I think, I tend to be long-term oriented in general and also prioritize things in my life more than just financial and Status, although Those are important to me, but I married and having a good relationship with my wife and making sure she is happy as obviously top of the list for me as well."

I'm not a very Rock the Boat kind of guy like to just kind of go with the flow and get on board. ORD with everybody and avoid conflict. I think I'm a conflict diverse person and sometimes that's a bad thing. But I think overall it's a good thing because there's some people that go out of the right to initiate conflict and I try to resolve conflict and ultimately I think that is a more healthy environment for everyone to be in.

When everyone else is scared to say that, I think she would describe me as a very strong individual, physically and mentally and someone who can face adversity and troubles with Strong Outlook and be able to work through problems and work through any type of issues that may arise in her life. I think my best friend would describe me as someone who is very thoughtful, very loving. I know she thinks of me as one of the best human beings out there even though I'm nowhere near it. And True probably describe me as one of the best people you've ever met and those are her words and I mind she's using that, she used them before her words, but she would, she would probably in has has described as one of the best people you'll ever meet solely because of who I am my morals, my ethics. Everything that makes me me."

So in between you know, figuring out how we're going to get drivers out safely and if drivers are even I'm willing to drive because a lot of drivers by that time had said they're going home early and they didn't feel comfortable going across town in order to deliver for their job. I had to decide whether to divert them to the drive through which I worked at, or keep deliveries going on. And if they were to divert to the drive-through, it would be safer for drivers. But I would most likely get less tips because Those individuals who had to switch from delivery, to pick up, would probably feel some type of way and not want to get up and actually get out into the storm and pick up their own food. So, because of that and because of my position at the job, I had to make a decision, but when I'm in situations like this, I usually think of what would be the best outcome. Not just for myself, but for Other employees in my co-workers, what would be the safest outcome depending on if safety is a factor and what would be the more logical outcome? What's going to be the most logical way and I think I think like that mainly to it's like a utility utilitarianism the greatest good for the greatest amount of people although people may be upset that they're not getting their food, I would rather people not get their food and order a different day or find a different Pizza. Place then drivers, get in accidents and getting hurt over people not getting their food because if my drivers are hurt then no one's going to get their food regardless. So yeah."

So when I first started joining or when I join a new team in general, my first line of work first, I guess line of work is the best way to put it is observing besides listening and listening to instructions and you know getting trained observing is one of the biggest part because although they may tell you one thing they may act another way they may tell you we usually go to lunch or for but after You observe you realized it's usually for 15 because of timelines and clean up. So the best way to learn and to insert yourself in a new team is to observe and do things the way they do. Because although you may not agree. You with the way everyone moves or you may not agree with everyone's actions, they are in fact there for a reason and the reason they do things the way that they do is because it works for them and you will realize that the longer you are on a team so go and continued as follows and as they do it. So that it doesn't make anyone you don't make anyways, but it doesn't cause any time type of breakthrough within the team itself. It Kate, it may cause problems if you decide to change the way that they have ran things and the reason I think this way is because it creates the best situation and the best environment for me and for my other teammates creates a good way for me to insert myself without making problems and also for them to take me in without there being any issues"

But when people do annoy me, I tend to let it be and let those feelings pass because annoyances a temporary feeling, there's no one who has annoyed me from the whole time. I spend with them from beginning to end, most people are annoying in certain behaviors and certain things they may say, but that's not their whole self. Just like some of my behaviors and some of the things I say, man, knowing other people, that's not who I am. And that is how my whole core I react. Not at all. If I'm being honest, I don't really react to people annoying me. I could get overstimulated. Um, but When then, that over simulation, doesn't cause me to lash out or in any type of way or react adversely to anyone. I think it's better to let these type of feelings past, because it's so much. It causes less problems than if you were to react to any type of temporary feeling like annoyance or even anger. And I think I react this way solely to make sure I don't cause any problems because if I cause problems and if I I decide that this is the time that I'm going to react. I could create more issues for myself than if I were to leave the situation alone it's so much better to leave the situation alone and let bygones be bygones, then to react and create even more problems with my reaction."

Not just with their managing, but also with their communication skills with the assistant managers, which was myself and other former employee and their communication with their other other employees in my subordinates. So This was not just a problem with that but there was also a problem with physical organization within the company with how much ice cream was ordered, how much ice cream is put in the freezer, how they would organize the deep freezer and how all of those things came because a lot of that became a big problem, very quickly, and all of that was left for the lower employees to deal with. So when that became a big issue, Shoe. We decided to me and the other assistant manager decided to take it upon ourselves to create a team in order to fix this organization, the physical organization. And when communication problems arose, we created a time for us to really talk with our teammates, we created a separate work group chat without the head, the store Owner the franchise owners so that we can communicate amongst ourselves when there wasn't communication within management and we created an open work environment where people were not afraid to speak up and we're not afraid to communicate so that we can fix that organizational issue. Within that part. The physical organization took a lot of team members, deciding what they're willing to do. And what Part they were willing to play and once we found that out, the rest kind of just came into fruition."

We've known each other since we were six years old, we're still in touch. I would be there in a heartbeat. If she asked me to be and it's important to me that she returns that and I think that's what inspires my loyalty is having loyalty from her. I think she would call me passionate about a lot of different things including my ambition, I'm passionate about being successful in whatever job I take on and it's something that she's known about me since we were young. It's probably why we're best friends because she herself is very ambitious, she knows that I'm very family-oriented family's really important to me. Nothing means more to me than my mother and my father, and staying true. To the way we grew up which is a small town life. She and I both Both moved to larger cities after college but I still like to go back and and experience that small-town atmosphere, visit small businesses, that we grew up going to when we were teenagers. So I think that that's how she would. She would describe me as passionate loyal, traditional and ambitious."

The last time, this happened was three years ago. I was in a job that I loved my manager, my executive the agency was somebody that I've worked for four years. Somebody that I trusted that I really considered a mentor, not just professionally but also personally, But when the job opportunity came that I hold. Now it was something that I just didn't think that I could pass up and I did consider that it likely meant higher status and more money. But I really wanted to think about my, my track, my professional track my career as a whole. I like I like I mentioned, I loved my job and I loved who I worked for, but there had been things that happened. That led me to believe that there wasn't much room for advancement. And for me there. And so when I was thinking about this professional decision, to take another position, even though it hurt me, it hurt my heart and I worried about how it would be taken by my mentor my boss. I really thought that I had to give myself an opportunity to go somewhere where I could grow both professionally and personally, and yes, that did include an increase in status and money and it, you know, it really I felt a little Tasteful to talk about it like that and so when I broke when I offered my resignation I did try to put forth the idea that this would help you know my advancement for the rest of my life just to make sure that they understood that there was nothing personal about me leaving because it was important for me to leave on a good note and to continue that personal relationship and I hope it. I hope it didn't work out that way."

But when I join a new, a new group and your team generally, I'm pretty pretty exuberant. I know that that can be kind of overwhelming, but the last few times I've been involved in introduced into a team, it's been in a leadership role and I think that's a little bit different than when you Come on as a member of a support staff or as a lower member of a team you're coming in to meet people that you really want to follow you from day one. And so I think it's important to go in there with just a really warm welcoming nature with energy and so they sort of know what fro what they can expect from you both as a person and as a boss as a leader. And so that's why I really like to, I won't say dress in bright colors. But I'll typically wear something that is a bit more different than just a basic black and white outfit. But but just something that maybe shows my personality a little bit, I do really try to get as many names as I can that first day and I'm terrible with names, but try to meet everybody one-on-one and shake that their hand and try to get that personal connection with him as quickly as I can, so that they can start building that trust with me as soon as possible."

I felt like I was doing a good job of listing and responding and agreeing when he made good. Good points. But it didn't seem like that was reciprocated to me. And so after a while of course, that that caused me to be less welcoming and receptive to anything, he was saying. And so instead of working towards, you know, a compromise, it was clear that he was only going to accept his position and that may be less willing to kind of compromise in his Direction. So it wasn't a very good conversation and I actually ended up going and following up with him later and saying, hey, why did we come at this? Like with butting heads instead of trying to find a way to work together and you know, we talked some more. He was still a little bit stiffer than I wish you would have been but you know, he had what he felt was around, its knowledge of the of the issue. And I think that that the initial conversation was in front of other people and there were some fear of him feeling wrong in front of those other people, which is why maybe he pushed back towards me so much. And once I understood that, you know, just something I sort of added to my knowledge bank. That next time, this comes up with this type of person. Perhaps I approached him first independently before the issues discussed in front of a group since he seems to be sensitive to a peering wrong or incorrect."

My desk is a very messy work space and I don't know exactly why that is, I tend to know where things are, or I feel like I know where they are, but I understand that it doesn't really have the immediate impression of someone whose professional my supervisor. In fact, I can almost feel the eye roll. Even though he keeps it to himself when he walks past my office and sees the mess. On the desk. I don't quite understand. No, I do is something I'm working on though. Just last week, I had a support staff member process, a large pile of paper that have been in my dad's for probably about two years. And, you know, there was a nice light feeling after that was done. So I'm trying to hold on to that feeling and and that sense of you job accomplishment to encourage myself, to take a better be more, proactive at keeping a organized workspace and Understanding that that would lead to more organized work and more timely completed work."

My ability to work well with others and my ability to problem-solve I think maybe a weakness I have is that often I want the project to be the best they can be and sometimes that is not the goal. I think oftentimes I maybe want to get the work done all by myself but that's what delegating is for and yes.

And I understand that sometimes people when they come to you, they may not be asking you for a specific answer. They just want someone to listen. And so I think that's something that she would say that I do really well. Additionally, I think she would also say that I am passionate and that when I want something, I do everything in my power to get that done."

Quite recently, I decided to change employment for a company that offered me less money. However, at the end of the day, I do think it was the correct decision because the stress and the workload and the environment of my previous employment was not conducive. Of to how I work best. And so even though I'm making less money, I'm much happier."

It's not because of intimidation or shyness, but honestly, I'm just being observant of the work environment and of the Dynamics between people. I think sometimes the easiest way to integrate yourself into a group of people is just to see how everybody already interacts with each other, it can do a lot to avoid issues.

Usually, the first thing I do is to take a deep breath and try to reassess the situation from an outside standpoint. I think there are much worse, things in the world than being annoyed. So I try to remind myself in that situation, that being annoyed is okay. Sometimes, I'm not in any physical danger. I'm not in pain, I'm the safe and that annoyance isn't going to last forever. Oh ever. So I just try to handle it with a clear head."

Sometimes we get caught up, sometimes we get busy. Honestly, beating yourself up about it doesn't really do much. We set up systems in place to help us, stay organized. And if we need to be assessed or just to see how we can better be efficient than, that's what we do. Okay. Oh, why do I think that is? I think I just get busy sometimes, and instead of beating myself up about how, I wish my space was I do my best in the moment and later I assess how I can make it better."

One of my weaknesses would be sometimes a lack of time management or an underestimation of the amount of time something's going to take. So yeah, I would be basically putting things off too often. Sometimes procrastinating on certain projects. But a way that I've learned to overcome this is by time walking better and then like with as a being in a leadership role being able to delegate out all these positions as separate time box for everyone. So then leaving a longer amount of time at the end of it in order to just plan and know exactly how long things are going to take and have time to review it and not have things going to dummy super last minute."

She might describe that as one of my downfalls, but I, I'm trying and she's helped me a lot.

It had us working. Just alone like me and maybe another girl around my same age, probably 15 16 may be at the time and I had to make a decision one point if I was going to be able to do shifts on my own and this was a big step for me. I usually behave in these types of situations with a lot of caution because I really am someone who likes to think things through and consider all decisions beforehand. So I think in this particular decision I thought things through I realized I could do it. I had the confidence to do it. I told her I could do these, just Sloan and ultimately she was able to end up paying me more. As a result of this and I was able to learn skills that I wouldn't have learned or experience that I wouldn't have gotten without this."

It was really, it was probably one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make because it was such large sums of money. I didn't really know how to conceptualize, how much money that was.

I often do not have the time to kind of sit down and think about how things should be organized and which items need a place. I have sort of a classroom of sorts that I need to keep organized. My desk is, usually the most organized place. Because that's the place I am sitting at the longest, I would say, but my classroom is a bit harder to organize. You have to consider the fact that sometimes kids move things, what needs to be hidden, what needs to be visible? What is breakable versus non? I take all these into consideration and sometimes it takes time to figure out what works and what doesn't and what materials are needed. And so over time, I've been able to capture that and organize things pretty well, and again, slow process with materials that I have versus don't have. But if given enough time, I can definitely make things better because I'm always looking to improve in that area.

I had a lot of turnover within my team and because my supervisor saw that, I was empathetic and had the potential to Be a great leader and I was a person who was in charge of training all the new cumbers and not only that, but I took the initiative to develop a standard operation procedure to make it easier to train people in the future which show that I was thinking short-term about the people that we had on staff, but also the long-term success of the team. And one of my weaknesses kind of goes a line with helping others is sometimes it can be difficult for me to say no. However, I do always know that I need to prioritize. The, what's going on at my job in my role? And I've gotten better at letting people know and being honest about, you know, hey, I can't help you right now, but maybe check in in a day or two or say no."

And during work, if I am given a responsibility, for instance, for a project, I am known to get it done in time, and I usually try to get it done a few days before it's actually the deadline. That way I can get, I have time to ask for feedback and Wait, any feedback that is necessary. And my friends also find me reliable as whenever we are hanky. Now, I always end up going there on time and I'm not never late. And if I say that, I'm going to do something, and I commit to going somewhere with them, then I'm good at not canceling. And I would also say that my friends, typically think that I am a good listener. As I am very empathetic, and And they can see that when we are hanging out, they'll tend to ask if I have any advice for them and that also aligns with my work as a lot of my co-workers and would go for me if they were having trouble with their work and they would ask me for advice which I was happy to give them."

And I think that I have this opportunity for growth and therefore will be staying at this company for a long time and can really work on strengthening the relationships that I have in the community and learning and challenging myself."

Once you find something that you have in common, you're able to let your guards down a bit more, and it's easy to build trust and build a good working relationships. With each other. I also find myself to be an inclusive person and so I would try to sit next to someone during lunch or ask if someone wants to go on a walk during break, just to get to better know someone. And I would also if I'm joining a new team, I would ask if I can chat with someone because I think it's important to learn from others and for others to see that, you know, you are self-aware and you do want to learn. And hopefully, Later on Provide support to your team members as well. And so that's usually how I behave when I am with the new team."

And you know I can't control how they're acting but I can control how I will react and so I try to maintain Diplomat. See when I be diplomatic. When I am with the person and then if I'm stressed later on, I will usually go for a walk to calm myself down as I have found that. That is helpful in stressful situations, especially if I go on a walk with a co-worker or a friend and that just helps me in those 10 minutes. You know? Clear my head that way I can come back and do my job."

And so, usually, if I have a few minutes, you know, say I've been staring at my computer a long time and I need a break from that. I will try to go through at least one or two cabinets. And throw away things that I no longer need or organize things better. So that my space looks neater because when my space is neater, I know that my head is more clear and I'm able to get my work done and it also provides a nice break. That way when I do need to go back to looking at my computer, I feel like I can better focus because I was able to have that break away from staring at it for so long."

I have very strong communication skills, both verbally and in writing, I'm good on the phone. I'm good in video chat media as well. And I love to kind of tap my team and work with people who are good at different things than I am because then we get to contribute to a really integrated and robust. Last team together and I think that's really great. I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to be a little bit perfectionistic and I tend to be a little bit hard on myself when I make mistakes and part of my process around that has been practicing cultivating acceptance when I make a mistake and like, doing what I need to do to address the issue and move forward in a productive and constructive way. And then also affording myself some Grace. And some care and patience when I make mistakes because everybody does and it's actually good because it means we're learning. Yeah."

I think my best friend would describe me as Thoughtful and silly and committed. I think, I really commit to activities and B, and like threads of thought. I think also creative. I have a lot of creative friends in my life, and I have a strong creative background and I think that comes up in, like, leisure activities, like watching movies or baking. I love to just like, be creative and be thoughtful and I'm getting distracted by my hair Hoops perfectionism. Um, but like my one of my best friends and I love to watch movies and like pick them apart and examine, those creative choices that are being made. And so I think thoughtful and thorough and 0 is also like detail-oriented this is like the time to slip that in but I would say, typically I am, yeah, I'm I am attuned to my surroundings and I think that lends itself well to Comedy and also to thoughtfulness and deep like The moment I think which is really important professionally as well with colleagues. And with clientele"

And so, I think it's so important that my Fundamental kind of True North is doing right by the people with whom I work. I think this is like a risky thing to say in an interview but this is a study. So I'm going to say it that's kind of fun. I think greed and Corruption are really Impeding our human capacity on like a really big cultural scale impeding. Our human capacity to connect and care for our communities and the people around us. And I think that in modern, at least in like modern Western society that I'm experiencing, I'm in the United States were so separate from each other, and I think that can be really toxic because we were meant to live in community. Oh, I'm going on a tangent. Not great. And then interview. Whoops. Thank you for your patience. Thanks for going on this journey with me. I think it's important to me to make decisions that I feel okay about at the end of the day. And I think doing right by other people regardless of money is the most important thing to me, which can be hard because also like needing money to live is a real factor in being a person. But I think I would lose sleep if I didn't prioritize doing right by other people. And I think that's, that's really what guides me and most of what I do."

I think that's probably pretty normal as like I'm adjusting and getting to know people typically I like to be in like a big group setting and do like I don't know like a work meeting like introduction kind of thing and just like everyone's names kind of a general sense of what everyone does. And then I like to kind of start finding the common Eggs, which can be like, we both like knitting or we both are from the west coast of the us, or just like, little common threads, and I don't know, generally, I think I'm looking for ways to connect with people. And so finding those little common threads and using those as like, kind of a baseline to build professional relationships on top of I think I do tend to be a bit quieter when I join a new team just as I'm kind of getting to know the Dynamics at Play. And I think that as I work with a group and have experiences with them and like handle situations with them, then I tend to get a bit more comfortable with them and we're confident in like my capacity to show up for the team as well.

So I try to take a sec to like, breathe and regulate and like, maybe come into my own space if I can and think, like, what is this? Bringing up in me. What is this reflecting back to me? Because I don't think that we're annoyed for no reason. And I also don't think that it's anyone else's responsibility, but mine to like notice and observe and manage my own annoyance, I think that's kind of Part of my job of being a person. So typically I try to like meet the person where they are complete the interaction. Make sure everybody leaves feeling or do my best to make sure that I'm pretty leaves feeling respected and heard and appreciated. And then I try to get curious with myself about maybe what my annoyance is cluing me in on, in myself."

I think, typically, when my workspace starts to become disorganized, I think it's generally a thing that happens when I'm feeling a little more overwhelmed or I'm in a stage of like transition or like, like maybe I'm traveling or maybe there's like some upheaval in my life, somewhere else. And I can see it visibly with, like my workspace. Usually, it's like a desk and typically, I'll start to notice when I'm seeing in my visual field, that clutter and I'll be feeling it in here as well. And those two together kind of clue me in that, maybe there's something else I need. And I find that I tend to initially have kind of a resistance of like clearing off my desk. For example, is going to be like so much work and I can't do that because I have to do all these other things I'm overwhelmed. And so, everything feels like it's going to take so much time and effort and be so big. And I think a lesson that I keep learning is that if I just clear off my desk that's one thing that helps and it clears off a little bit in here too but also even if it doesn't my desk is clear. Now that's great that's helpful and I think I tend to be focused on What are the words I'm looking for right now. I think generally I focus on the big picture to the extent that it's really easy for me to get overwhelmed, because I can't do everything at once. No one can and no one is really expecting me to, but I think it goes back to that perfectionism, to of, like, I want to accomplish everything and I want to be able to like picture it in my mind from beginning to end and sometimes that's not realistic. Sometimes Typically I think I just have to like remind myself that if I start I can get through the rest of it and figure out as I go and cleaning off my desk is just the first step. So I think brief answer, I can get kind of overwhelmed that can be reflected in my space and I think in general, I'm practicing trusting myself more to get started. Even if I don't have the end in sight because I can clean off my desk I can clean off my desk. I know I can do that."

So, I would say that my greatest strength and weakness is probably my ability to get things done in a timely manner and to an extent that serves the purpose of my job description in the description of the project that Working on but probably my greatest weakness would be that I can very quickly become you know, lethargic about something or just not focusing on, you know, whatever I'm supposed to be doing. And so it's a it's a greatness and weakness of the same time, so thank you."

I can definitely be a little bit more on the quieter side. If I'm around people, that I don't necessarily know as well or that I'm not in. So, he's comfortable with, but definitely energetic. We have a great time laughing and hanging out when we are together and just, you know, spending time together. Generally, I am much more on the quiet side, but typically, I can be brought out of my shell, a little bit when I'm around my best friend or around people who, Are energetic and I could match that energy and be energetic alongside of them. And so I think that is a huge area where I do appreciate, you know, like being friends and being around people that make me more comfortable and that make me more. Just make me have a lot more fun stuff. I usually will end up being much more energetic about things then. Perhaps I would be with other people and so I would say my best friend probably describe me as energetic. and fun but also very laid-back and calm and can typically usually be someone that is very supportive and whatever Endeavor, you know we're experiencing you're going through the yes would be very much so very supportive but also yeah, probably more quiet and laid-back, then then other people would expect me to be"

And, you know, when Integrity is put into question, it's very difficult to kind of know who you can trust in the people that are around you but I need your distinctly. Remember going through and thinking about use the situation and just my emotions towards it and my, you know, just personal like decision store. Is it and in the, you know, the process of that, I went through this situation and, you know, eventually made the right one to spite, you know, taking a little bit of a pay cut from it. And, you know, within that situation, it revealed the heart and the intention of the other people that I was working with, in the people that were around me. But personally, I think that Integrity is an important. Characteristic to have and it is important to do the right thing even though you know there are situations where maybe that can be put into check and maybe those situations. We will reveal the heart of the other people that you are working with, but it is important. And, you know, it is important for you to maintain your integrity and to maintain the things that you hold value of. And that you do not you, not necessarily let those things go. Just because You may take a pay cut but it's important to hold to that integrity and hold to those standards that you, you know, hold for yourself and that you hold valuable for, you know, your work ethic in all of those things."

I knew them a little bit but I didn't know them super well or know them well enough to you know necessarily feel comfortable with like the team Dynamic yet. And I think it's a little bit nerve-racking for a little bit intimidating to coming to A Team especially if you feel like they all are more. You know, just equipped to be working with one another maybe than you are. And so I think coming into that new team Dynamic was a little bit scary, a little bit terrifying, but it is also a good learning experience for me. And I grew a lot in just my confidence in speaking up about how I viewed things and how I value things, and I think the reason behind that and I feel the reason behind that is because of just the opportunity and the challenge that can And with with that growth and with that, just that challenge of growing a little bit more than maybe you're used to, and walking into a situation where you're not necessarily as comfortable with the people that you're around. But you also find a lot of opportunity to grow and to yacht just to go into value that into value. Just the growth that comes with that in your confidence and in your, you know, just your words and how you go through and how you present yourself"

And we're not devalue doing the other opinions and ideas that were being shared. And I think, you know, for me like that was just something that was not acceptable, and not something that I saw is acceptable. Nor was it something that I appreciated in their character and their behavior. I think that you know, in your character you should be treating everyone with kindness and everyone with the same, you know, respect as anybody else honestly. And so I think just like the fact that that was not necessarily the way that the situation was handled in just annoyed me and frustrated. Me and I don't necessarily see that as a character flaw because I think there are times when we can be justifiably annoyed and maybe a little bit frustrated with somebody Because of something that they are doing in something that isn't okay. And so I think that that would be a situation that annoyed me and the rectification of that situation is definitely more. So something that I would take into account and I would, you know, just maybe make a note of in future situations to just handle that better and maybe to communicate more clearly and more effectively with somebody about how that situation maybe feel."

And I appreciate having things that are organized when things are disorganized, I can function still inside of that. But my preference is to have things that are more organized into organizing in a manner that would be, you know, maybe a little more organized or just a little bit more, put together, which, I know doesn't bother everybody, but it definitely bothers me when my work. Space in my just environment that I am trying to get things done in and be productive in are not necessarily put together because I do not just see the value of that in. You know, I'm very organized in the way that I do things and maybe a little bit more methodical about how I do things so that there is order and so that nothing gets missed and yeah just probably a little bit more. Just organized about how I go about things and to make sure that my workspace is clean. So then my men, Little space can be a little bit more you clean and organized and just give me room to grow and to perform to the best of my abilities. Even when it's challenging your when it's difficult, I see that as a very valuable you know asset to have and to be able to also go through and help other organized so that the overall environment and workspace that the entire group is working in is one that we can all work in and thriving."

I was given and completed them very quickly and often was approached to To buy people patrons of the library for wanting to know where things were, which usually I knew where stuff was. So I was able to help them, I view myself as a very approachable person. So I think that was another reason why they approached me because I am very friendly demeanor. Very kind. I've been told that by many people but I am a very approachable person and I am easy to talk to and I'll try my hardest to help someone if I need if they need help. and I can extend that kindness out of but too much sometimes of not necessarily telling a person to stop if they go past a certain boundary or do something wrong and job but usually I try to work past that and state my position. So I it's something I work hard at to try to not let people necessarily take advantage of my kindness and I try to do my job effectively."

I'm annoyed either by my words or I usually get the certain facial expression on my face that can come across with it, will put across that I didn't like what the person said or did and sometimes people will get that just from the facial expression or they won't and they'll keep going. And I'll kind of the other thing I'll do at that point is to either try to keep explaining what I didn't like, or all just try to stop confronting them about it and I'll just let it be because it usually I've learned past a point it just won't change. If that just keeps going. So I think that a lot of the reason I became like that became part of my personality to do that is because of the way that I grew up and my mom often told me I need to stand up for get in. Two situations that people were taking advantage of me and going around and I wasn't able to stand up for myself when I was younger.

So I've never been somewhere where I've been the oldest. So this was definitely a new environment for me to adapt to and get used to when I behave when I enter a new team. I'm kind of shy at first but then I get to know the people and start to warm up and tell him about myself. Off and get to know more about them and then I try to hang out with them and really make my time working there. Enjoyable for me and for everybody"

Everybody sometimes annoys me, but I think that's a way that people are is that everybody gets on each other's nerves, especially if you're around them for a really long time. However, you just have to realize that, you know, you love them for them and you have them for how you work with them and how you are with them. So even if someone or situations, Amy, it's not permanent and usually, if I just let it cool off, then it'll be totally fine by the next day. And then nobody has to get aggravated with each other.

I enjoy life and I think that positivity is a great strength to have in the workplace. I can be persuasive and I can also generate new creative ideas for the company or the job at hand. And my weaknesses can be sometimes I'm a bit of a perfectionist or I become too worried about the outcome, not reaching my high expectations. Sometimes when I Aspire for such a high levels of greatness, I can be disappointed when the outcome doesn't reach my expectations. I'd also say another one of my strengths is my work ethic and willpower to keep working throughout you know, tough circumstances. And I think that also my attitude in general is a strength because I try to provide value to those around me. And I aspire to make the people around these day better and the work at hand easier to accomplish. So when I'm with other people, I find that I often Reflecting on how they feel and think about what I'm doing or my actions. Another one of my greatest weaknesses is probably my punctuality. I tend to be late or oversleep. Sometimes. That's because I don't really have a rigorous schedule like to be free-flowing with my schedule and work time. So sometimes if I have a set time to appear somewhere I may be late. You know? This is something I I can easily overcome through sleeping earlier or changing my schedule to align with the current needed time segments. But yes, I can be punctually late at times and this is a weakness because in the business world, people do not want you to be late.

Regardless of the circumstances, I think my best friend would describe me as someone that can be a bit self-critical and critical of others at times. I think I can be too critical because I do, I do truth truthfully. See the best in people and hope that they reach high aspirations. But sometimes people just cannot do that the sir at the current moment and I can at times, you know, call them out when is not needed, but I'm working on that. I'm trying to critique others because I find that does not help other people. And I think my best friend would understand this.

Had a job working for sales for a company. And I was dealing with a toxic work environment, toxic co-workers, and I decided to quit. I didn't put my two weeks in. I just said I'm going to quit and I never came back. I finished my shift that day, but I didn't come back, even though my boss you know, my boss tried to persuade me to Go work for a different branch somewhere else. But I was too emotional too hardheaded to stubborn because I thought I had been putting in great work. I thought I'd been really working hard at this company and the sales department and doing my best work. So, when the someone, my boss was like, you know, not reprimand me, but brought up a mistake I made, which was very slight mistake was, which was just me being informal. To a customer. I felt disrespected because I thought that my coworker was making outlandish remarks about about me and was being very toxic and I couldn't be in that environment. I hate being in the toxic work environment. I didn't like the upselling, part of the sales department that they were pushing us, to up sell products, it was against my morals. So, I decided to leave and I think that I behaved a bit stubborn, a bit hard-headed, and I think that is because, like I said, the way that the business and sales was operating was against my moral code. Code, it was against my ethics and when the business I'm working for is against my ethics and against my moral code, I think that. Yeah, I can be stubborn because I don't, I don't want to waste time working for a company that doesn't align with how I think, how, I believe, how I act what I think is right, what I think is fair. So when you know the company got mad at me. And I had to quit, I was stubborn and I was hard-headed. Also another situation would be when the owner of a large company tried to get me to become the head of the accounting department and I declined because I don't like doing accounting. I think that this diminished my status because I could have raised my status by being the head of the accounting department. But I do not enjoy accounting and because I do not enjoy the work at hand, I could Accept it because I have to love what I do in order to be at that."

Why I'm often a social butterfly often, very vibrant, very positive, very happy. And as time goes on, if they are coccyx, I start to lesson which kind of sucks because I should be able to stay positive and vibrant, but I times I am a bit too emotional, but it's because I expect them to be like me. I expect him to be vibrant and happy and loving and caring. You know, I think I'm like I'm this way because I just I if it's a job and I'm that I enjoy and I care about and it's I'm entering a new team to work on this job.

Why do I think this that I'm this way? Because my brain is very quick and quick witted I'm very observant. If I put a paper somewhere that, you know, in a stack of papers and it looks on unorganized, but I know exactly that that paper is in that stack of papers. I know where it is, in the stack of papers. I know how to find something where I put it. I don't forget where I put things, So, although it may be unorganized, it's also easy for me to decipher. It's easy for me to work in an organized space. I do like I said, I do prefer an organized space this because I do prefer cleanliness and organization can, you know, basically be cleanliness. But at the same time, if something is unorganized and I don't have time to really organize it, or I don't want to spend time organizing it, then I won't because, you know, that time could be better spent working on the project at hand and not distracting Myself by needing to clean or cleaning up because I will find what I need and then in an unorganized space regardless and I think that, you know, not everyone is like this. But I think that some people can work in unorganized spaces. And I am that type of person, I'd like an unorganized Nice space, because I'm very self-reliant, and I'm very happy inside of my own space. I'm very happy inside of my own body. I'm very happiness out of my own environment. So if something is unorganized and I could still work, I can still work very efficiently and he still work happily and I still work, I guess still get the job done very quickly and easily. So I don't really worry about organization too much. I just do what I have to do, and I get it done, and I think that a lot of people can relate but some people, they would think that I'm crazy but that's fine because I I still, like I said, get the work done in an organized space."

I'm currently I'm in my new role this year and my job entails a lot more work than my previous role for just about the exact same compensation. And I do ensure that I get all my work done in a timely fashion and I do the best that I can with in the limited time that I have throughout the day to complete my work. I would say my greatest weaknesses are being able to reach out and collaborate. I do find collaboration challenging because I do think that it takes more time than just getting things done on my own and I prefer to just take advantage of my time and work quickly, since I don't have it that much time throughout the day to plan and get things prepared. I do think that there are many benefits to collaborating and planning together. I just don't feel that I have that free time to spend getting things done with other people."

Like if I'm at a store and I see something that, I know someone will like favorite candy or an item that they movie franchise that they enjoy is on sale or it's just like a little something, I will pick it up and it will purchase it for them. I am kind of always thinking of others. I am quick to step out and help and support people that I love, you know. I'm usually the first person that people, my family call when they need help, or they need assistance for something. The problem solving or than you need to physically be there, I will arrange what I need to in order and in order to be able to go and physically be there for them and help them. I do think that most people would agree that I am just thoughtful and kind."

Don't have a lot of negotiations since we do work with in a contract that is set forth by our Union to ensure that it's fair. So I don't really make professional decisions that affect how much money you make or my status. I'm really just teacher. There's really no other role for me to play. I would not want to move up, become an administrator and I in order to make more money, all I have to do is ensure longevity within the career and just more credits, more continuing education credits. So that is something that I do regularly, I take advantage of professional development when it comes becomes available, just because of the opportunity to increase my salary. I don't think that there is any significant change in status for teachers, depending on what What step there in in terms of Education currently I'm at a master's plus 30 credits. I can move up to a master's Plus 90 credits and then the last step after that, would be to earn a PhD which I don't plan to do it any time in my career."

I going to put in the district, I'm going to new building, I'm going to enroll. I usually want to enter a new team. It's I, my usual behavior is that I am very quiet. I am rather introverted, and I don't necessarily speak, unless I actually have something to say. So when I'm in a new environment, I do is kind of like to observe and see what the dynamic is like and see how everyone else is behaving and what procedures there are. Following what habits they have. And then kind of see how my habits and my procedures, and my expectations behaviors compared to those before I reach out and kind of put myself on the spot. With those things, I'm not someone to raise my hand in a meeting especially when I'm new to say something, unless I specifically called on even when I feel like I know more or I do just know in general, what's going on and people? Who could benefit from my expertise? I will never be someone who will raise their hand in a group like that.

I have very fond memories of my childhood just being very much annoyed at classmates with in school or things that my parents or my sister said to me, when someone's in the wing me, I tend to get very flustered because it's generally a situation that I cannot immediately step out of, or I'm annoyed because Cuz some someone's behavior and I'm not a control, someone else's behavior that could just become incredibly frustrating to be annoyed that someone is just engaging in something that's just irritating. I do like to control my environment and my reaction to what's going on around me. And when someone's annoying you and you can't step out of that situation, it's very frustrating and I don't necessarily enjoy It. For example, when I was in high school, I really found it annoying. When students, ask questions about a topic or an idea that the teacher had just finished elaborating on and I would just tell them pay. They just answer that question. If you didn't understand it, or you are paying attention, that's not on us. I don't want to have to listen to that. Again, you should go to extra help. So just stuff like that has always annoyed me. I don't necessarily have a lot of Patience, for people who aren't paying attention, and expect that repetition. That's probably one of my biggest triggers for just getting annoyed and someone's not listening and then they expect to just to do the same thing over again just from their lack of attention."

This year, teaching five different levels every day, which requires a lot more differentiated paperwork between levels. So because of that, I just have a lot of things to keep track of on my personal workspace and it can get pretty cluttered right now. And occasionally it is not organized. It is not typical of me to not, have it be organized. I think sometimes when it's just not organized, just not a priority. Like I said, I do have a lot of work to planning to get done on the day-to-day and with five different levels to prep plan grade, and provide feedback. For sometimes just keeping my papers physical papers, organized just not become a priority. So I will just leave a pile on my desk in organizer. First thing the next day. Day. But I do function better when things are organized and labeled and I can see them and they're easily accessible. So that is not common at all for me."

Generally in the past I worked at on a research lab and I was able to communicate and express my opinions of others while also taking into account their opinion. So I'm good at kind of looking at both sides of an argument and evaluating what the best. Option would be. And as for weaknesses, I tend to be kind of shy when I first start a position. So I might be less likely to ask questions. However I've been working on that and what given enough time and instruction in a certain role, I find that I become comfortable and then as I'm more comfortable, I'm better at answering or asking needed questions. And I'd say that my strength definitely help with that weakness as being able to communicate with a lot of people makes me more comfortable."

Think this is really helpful for the work force because you never know what type of people are going to be interacting with. So it's really helpful to be able to connect with a wide. Wide range of people and even some people that you wouldn't necessarily like to interact with outside of the workplace. I think it's good to be able to handle these people and as if you did like them and I think I'm really good at that because I am really good at bringing up small talk and gauging the person I'm talking to and yeah."

I found that I wasn't as stressed when I actually came into work and because of that, my productivity was much better.

However, I'm I found that I'm able to quickly warm up once I start to connect with people, all usually take a little bit of time to get to know everybody individually so that when we're in a large group setting, it's not as daunting.

Our argument, I feel comfortable bringing that up. However, if it's a situation where the annoyance is very benign and bringing anything up, would worsen the situation I'm capable of biting my tongue and kind of just allowing it to happen and knowing that that situation won't happen forever and that's just really because I feel that I'm very good at predicting certain outcomes and I always want to do the best thing for this.

Then I'd say, typically like every week I'll organize my things and then by the end of the week, it'll be a mess. But I think the mess actually Ali tends to make me feel more productive as when I have a clean space. It's kind of like too neat for me.

So I think I do that because confrontation is really scary for me.

I am my own person, of course, but I think it's very important when especially coming into a new team that has already established certain relationships and methods of like ways they work together. It's Important to do your very best. Not to disrupt that funk shui. If you will, that sort of, for lack of a better word that vibe that is already been created. But what I tend to do is, I do my very best to make myself present myself as as what I can bring to the team.

So when working in at a job or in any sort of Team regardless of the circumstances it is the very edit, it is to the team's benefit, for everybody, who is a part of that team to assume that while we're in In at work or while we're in this environment, in which the team is working to accomplish a certain goal that everything that is being done is being done with the success of the team. In mind that being said, a certain attitude in which somebody might be that something might come across. Let's say, somebody's needing to get by you and they say, they say they say move, they don't even say, excuse me, right? It's a move. That could easily be mistaken as very rude and they get could be very easily taken. Personally, in fact, the that exact scenario happened to me when I was a part of this team, whose goal was to sort of help facilitate facilitate the flow of a theater competition for the state and immediate my immediate reaction, of course, was take that a little personally, and be like, oh, excuse me, But I always just take a second to myself, take a deep breath and just acknowledge that fact that they might not have even had my feelings in mind when they said that, which may be might be a little brute but also it means that I shouldn't take it personally because at the end of the day, it's going to be all for the benefit of what we're trying to accomplish together."

Like a tidy workspace can also in ways influence and improve the way that we function and the way that we are able to prioritize things and see our goals and organize tasks or prioritize tasks. So that being said, I do my very best to keep things at least somewhat organized. I have been sort of, people have described sort of my workspace as organized chaos. And by that, it definitely does not look messy at the end of the day. There's a difference between messy and sort of my sort of organized chaos. I guess that I'm sort of describing here but as long as not only I'm able to know in regards to what I interact with and move and sort on a daily basis. As long as I'm able to know where all that is and where it goes. Everything has a place and a place for everything. Nothing and everything in its place, I guess. But I also need to be able to communicate that to other people who might be interested in to my workspace. That way they are also able to do what they came into my space to do, you know what I mean? If I can't do that then I would consider that messy."

I think this is just generally because I tend to be an action-based person. I'm not I don't beat around the bush so I tend to be action-based but then past that, like, rash point, I do think that I do act rationally. I think, I generally speaking, I really consider what I need to react with what's important for me to react in like a certain way. I think this is just generally because I'm a rational person. I try to consider what the consequences of my actions are and The importance of really considering what I'm doing and like what, how that can impact these people that I'm getting annoyed with?"

Organized, if you want an effective life, I think that if my workspace were to be not organized, I would have to be under an immense amount of stress and I'll really have the time.

So I feel like I'm a really strong Communicator. I enjoy working with lots of different groups of people. So it's very easy for me to work with kind of all different groups and I think that's very important as a manager. I'm also very punctual and organized, I think punctuality is the big thing. You never want to come off bad to a client or potential. Customers of punctuality is very big for me. And again I'm very organized. They like to keep track of everything and planners and Excel sheet. So I make sure that I'm always on top of everything and I'm never forgetting something that could be deemed, very important. I would say my weakness kind of goes along with that. Although I am very organized. I do like to do everything very very thoroughly and make sure that I'm really on top of everything. So I like everything to be perfect which can cause an issue, I guess you could say, in terms of time management I always make sure that I get everything done but I feel like I could be better. ER, at managing my time and really kind of separating everything, obviously, some tasks are more important than others. So I've really been working on prioritizing those and putting time aside specifically for those more important task just to make sure even though I'm on top of everything that I'm able to get everything done that's needed. But the most important things come first."

I think the first thing that she would say is I'm really friendly I get along well with different groups of people all the time. And I always try and make everyone that I'm around feel welcome and feel heard. I know sometimes it can be difficult when you're in the large group of people. You kind of feel that no one's really paying attention to you or you as a person. So I always try to make everyone feel very welcome. Another thing that I would just like to think that she would describe me as is funny. I again kind of goes along with being a I'm going I really like to make people laugh. And again, make everyone feel comfortable and I think that a good joke is a really good way to do that or even just some sarcasm, some self-deprecating. Humor things of that nature because if you're not willing to laugh at yourself, then who else is going to be going to laugh at your jokes and really again it's way easier to make someone feel comfortable if you're able to kind of lighten the mood or break the ice that way. Another thing that I think she would describe me as as self-disciplined I would say, I'm very on top of everything in both my work and personal. Personal life, whatever. I need to get something done, I make sure it gets done in a timely manner so I'm very self discipline. I'm not one of those people that will put something off until the very last minute. I'm definitely on top of everything and overall I think she would just say I'm kind of like I said I really like to work with different groups of people. And I really like to make people feel as comfortable as possible in any given social situation."

I do like to volunteer myself for that even though it might put more on myself, I like to show that I'm a leader and I really am willing to help people and it Needed again, even if that does put more work on myself, I think I do this because I've always seen myself as a leader, even in projects, in high school college, I am usually the one who steps up and is willing to speak for the group and is really able to kind of mesh. Everyone's ideas together. I like to show that I'm really a go-getter and willing to help people when they're in need. Which I feel is a very strong competency of a candidate who's looking for a managerial role. So I feel like, even though again it might put a little bit more work on me.

I really kind of put myself out there, although I do feel I'm very outgoing in a group setting and a little bit more reserved especially if I'm eating with people, I'm not really familiar with for the first time especially if they all know each other. I do think this is just because again I have a little bit more anxiety. So I like to make sure that I'm always going to make a good first impression because I feel like that's very important and you never know who's going to be meeting with you later in life in a different situation. So I try to be more reserved and kind of let my personality come out a little bit more. The more that I get to know people but I'm always friendly and kind and like to meet other people Theory.

So, in those situations I really just try and take a step back and think of kind of that person's perspective again. If it's very important to them, it could be affecting their performance or something. So I tried, just to kind of see it from their view. Even if If I might find it a little bit annoying, there's usually a reason behind the annoyance and if something is really bothering me, I do try and take a step back for a few minutes instead of replying right away with confessed fingers and creating kind of a hostile situation. I like to just kind of take a step back, Mark, the email, or Mark, the call ISM red and come back to it when I'm feeling a little bit better. I think that I do this because I don't ever want to offend someone or upset someone because I responded quickly just because they were annoying me or getting on my nerves. I really do.

I feel like I'm a very organized person. I like to keep track of everything in my email and different spreadsheets and things of that nature. So it's definitely not typical. I'm very on top of things for the most part. But as everyone does, or has situations happen where they get really busy and things, get a little bit more disorganized, I really just try. And even though I might not technically have the time To do that. I really like to set some time aside so that I can really get myself reorganize because that's only going to help me in the long run again even though it might take an extra day in a couple more hours of work, I'd rather take care of it, kind of grab the bull by the horns and just take care of it right away. So it doesn't become again issue in the long run. So I don't think that I'm typically disorganized, but if I ever do feel like I'm being disorganized again, I just kind of Step Aside, make sure everything and everyone is kind of on the same page and then really get back to the grind and get back to working hard on something."

Anyways, we go to person to. We talk about their personality. No, we don't talk about the person. We look at how they are personally personality. We look at their personality Person one that might be a very angry person. Might not really want to talk to me. Person to might be very outgoing person might want to talk to me. Person 3 might be a very shy person. You know doesn't really want to talk to me. Doesn't really say much, you know, like hi. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know. Simple words. One word responses, you have to look at these things when you're when you're the new team of people because this team of people is your new team. You have to learn how to function with them."

Why do you think that is? So let's say, for example, my boss comes up to me, is it? No it at me, okay. Oh, he's not annoyed at me, I'm annoyed at him for yelling at me over something I didn't do in a situation like this, I had to keep a level head. I have to keep my emotions in check like I mentioned in previous questions, keeping my emotions in check is priority number one. So let's say he's annoying. Me right now. I'm getting yelled at over something. I didn't do. I'm going to keep my mouth shut. I'm going to listen to what he says. And as argumentative person that I am, I'm going to counteract his accusation. You know. You have evidence that I did this stuff. You know, how many people told you that I did this? Usually when someone annoys me I think of ways to, you know, counteract that annoy is mm. That's in me. I can't, you know, be outgoing Lee angry at this person. You know at my boss whoever is annoying me Wow, I'm angry at this person and, you know, I start screaming, it's going to give a bad Overlook of how I look on the people. So I would say if someone's annoyed or someone is annoying me, keep a level head. Listen to what they have to say and counteract that argumentatively."

Why do you think that is so situations when my works? Are my work or work space was not very organized. So let's say, for example, we have a very bad day. So very quick day, very busy day, not organized to way too quick, everything's out of order. So how would we fix this? How typical is it of the workplace for my work? Space not being organized. I would say the only reason it would not be organized as if I'm being lazy. There's no excuse for my workplace or workspace or work to not be organized. Even if it's a rush day, there is always a solution. It is not typical of me to be on organized. It is not typical of me to be, you know, Overwhelmed by a lot of work, all of a sudden. Why do I think that is? It's because of my mindset being disciplined in situations. Like, this is a must, you cannot just, you know, be like, oh, too much work. I think I'm going to give up. You cannot be like that. You have to overcome these situations. The best way you can, even if you're going to be a little bit behind, do as much work as you can, does it matter, does it matter if you have one or two assignments that you have do, does it matter? Do you have to do it? You have to keep moving forward, even if there's going to be a little bit behind at least you're only two assignments behind and not a whole day of work behind, so it is not typical of me to be unorganised. I typically counteract this as best as I can."

But when I have joined new team, They usually behave in a quiet way shy. I also act a little bit more professional, so that they know who they're dealing with in a professional setting. I feel like personal talk personal interactions come a little bit later. I just think I do this because it's at the end of the day. It's a job. You're at a professional setting.

So migration we it says is I'm very committed and I'm very dedicated. Generally if I'm getting given a task, I will finish the task and I will do them as efficiently as possible. So if it's something that they sailed take me an hour but I have all week to do it. I'm going to do it within the first hour. I'm giving it given to given it to. If I have the time to do it, as I feel I want to be do things efficiently. So if you give me something right away, I'm going to do that task. If I have the time to complete it right away, as I want to be able to get feedback on the task. Should there be any changes needed? I don't want to like be Placement and wait for things to finish.

So my best friend would describe me as someone who is very committed and serious, but at the same time, I am someone who's very fun. I like to, like, express myself and do things in different unique ways. There might also say I'm a little opinionated but only for the fact that like, I like, I'm very I like to talk about things that I'm passionate about and I do a lot of research on things that I'm passionate about and because of that I feel they would say that I'm a little opinionated just because like I do I do look up things I'm passionate about. So I know how to talk about them. So if someone comes comes up to me to a subject and I'm interested in or I'm knowledgeable about I am going to want to converse with them about it but they will also say that I know how to admit when I'm wrong and that's a big thing. I think they would say about me that not a lot of people could say, it's like some people kind of stick to their guns but like if I hear an argument for something, I'm going to have a point then I'm I see new facts. I'm willing to change my opinion and I think that's what my they would say about me."

My professional status generally in terms of professional status or how much money I make. I like to to pursue things that are going to make me happier than I'm going to enjoy more rather than make more money. Like sure. I would like to make more money, but if I'm not going to enjoy it as much or it's going to like be something that I'm just really hating, I'm actually going to stray away from them. Um, so for me, the reason I think I do that is just I don't live a bad life. Like I don't have all the money in the world. I don't get to buy everything I'd like, but being able to be happy with the things I have in the situation, I am in life, I feel like, at the very least, this is something that I've always kind of, like strived for. So I think I can basically, as long as I can live my life, comfortably, not like struggle. I don't need to like Do things. I don't enjoy just to make a little bit of extra money and I think that for me is the most important thing and it's the reason why I kind of like make those decisions when it comes to do.

I kind of our Ford and I introduced myself talk about things. I like find out things they'd like to see if find out things that we may have in. Common, and the reason for this I think it's just I think it's better to get everything out of the way. So people aren't like questioning and second guessing like does this person like this are they this type of person and so on generally. I just like to be very forward and kind of be like be not the aggressor is not the right word but basically be someone who shows initiative and I like to like let them know that and that they'll know that's the type of person I am by doing that."

It's so generally people don't know me too much and when they do it's generally because they like they're trying to they know something gets on my nerves and they're doing it on purpose to elicit a reaction. And generally when that happens like I'm quick to call them out, I don't like kind of sit there and let them annoy me without saying anything. I'm kind of very someone who's very like if you want to like, say something to me. I'm very like forward with. Like I'm going to tell you that you're bothering me and then I would like you to stop. Top. And from the reason, I think I am that way. It's just because I feel like nothing good comes from just kind of letting things do and sit there and not being very forward with it. And so I think for me just being very forward and direct is the most for me is like I think the very most important thing and when someone's annoying you I think if you just let it stew, they're just going to keep doing it."

What do you think that is? So this one. I actually can't really think of a situation where my workspace is not very organized. As like I'm always organized like I have to put things back in the right places. I have to know where things go. So like this situation, like I feel like just does not come up. If something is not organized, I'm going to fix it on the spot before I do anything else because I like to have everything in the right place for when I'm doing my tasks. And I guess the reason For that is just I feel like it just makes me be more efficient and without doing that, like I'm not going to be able to work properly. I'm going to be focused on the mess rather than doing the work. So reason I would again, I guess I'm a little short, but again, I just feel like being organized for me is something that it helps me accomplish my goals."

I can make quick plans and and then I can do them due to being Well, I guess I would say, my weaknesses would be sometimes due to my quickness. Sometimes I can Overlook things.

When crowds are together, you know, we can all get along. And we all, like, doing the same things. I also think that she would describe me as being very honest. If I, I'm not very critical. If I as far as being honest goes. I think that a lot of the, when I am being honest, I feel like I probably am being honest about my mistake.

I think one of the one professional decision that I did make at one time was there was a group of Us of three and we each had a specific job that we needed to do to complete a very large project in a very short amount of time. I did tell the others basically what to do and how to do it to get the most effective product out the door and the time restraint that we had at the end, close to the end of the time. Restraint, only about three quarters of the project was done. We ran out of time and we did not get the project out of the door as requested, the customer was very upset. I did not did not affect how much money I made it. Did not dock, my pay but The end, my professional decision affected, my status in the fact that the, I believe that the boss, the, well, not really the boss, the supervisor, and the other employees that was involved, because there were more than just the three of us involved. But I believe that my status went down a notch, just because of the way that I handled things and it could be possible that I could have handled it a Bit a bit differently. So since there was such a time restraint I was very nervous and so I didn't know 100% on what to do. I didn't have a plan of attack per se"

I do interact with everyone in the company but I also am closer to others than I am other people within the company. So when I do join a new team of people, I get excited just because I think everybody has their own ideas and they can put their own ideas within the company and they can, it just, it just brings different ideas and different personalities to the And so I tend to be very excited. Typically I will just jump right in, let them know who I am on a professional level. Sometimes we get a little personal, you know, we share like our families and things like that.

I work around with, but there is one person in particular, he Since he's been there for so many years, he tends to feel like he's more Superior than others. So when other people will come to work that have not been there, very long, he tends to boss those people around sometimes and not so nice ways. Due to me being the nice person that I am. I kindly usually will tell him, hey, maybe you can like let up a little bit. He doesn't like it when I say stuff like that to him, just because he's very set in his ways, he's an older gentleman.

Oil. Weaknesses. Sometimes I have a hard time delegating responsibility. I'm really just like I'll just do it myself but sometimes it's not the best method for certain jobs. Another weakness I would say is time management. I can be you know I get wrapped up in the thought and sometimes lose track of time so that can be a little troubling. But yeah, I mean I think in the deal with our and employees just being a hard worker and also another strength is that I'm a pretty smart guy. Pretty sharp Problem Solver.

A mile in their shoes as they say, I think that's what a lot of the world is lacking right now, especially as we go through some turbulent times.

Say, it's so gauche to talk about money but I think as we've Traversed. These last few years. I think it's kind of important that we think about those things and know that we are being compensated for our value or that we know are worth and can fight for those things. I just made a career change post covid to education and so that came with a little more rigid schedule. But also going to take increase, that is afforded me. Some more flexibility and stuff, which is nice and security I guess. But like I say generally I don't particularly care for situations to talk about money because you know my kindness kind of comes out and you know I'm not really the one who drives a hard bargain or is overly Why was he not a vicious? But, you know, hard knows where I'm all about getting the dollars.

So I'm always trying to be super kind and you know, make you feel comfortable. I think that's the one of the main things when you're meeting new people is is making sure people feel comfortable because that's when people are their most authentic selves. I think you know, they're not in high-stress situations or when they're not trying to put all. And so I try to break the ice or make it seem so it's not a stressful situation. I think I would people usually I usually endear myself. Do people in that way. So actually enjoy that, you know, socially you know we have similar interests or whatever.

So I think that sometimes I can put it in a way where It's not off-putting or rude but I think, you know, we don't are not real with our feelings or emotions that can really be detrimental to us in the long run. So I think we have to, you know, recognize what hurts us, you know, annoyance obviously is not definitely but you know, recognize those things that are nagging and you know, I'd be causing us harm in some small way, recognizing it and addressing it. And hopefully finding a better way to go about doing it."

I'm being that I'm education now, it's definitely bitten me in the bed a couple times, you know, that being is organized. You know, I'm an actor creative person. So sometimes I could leave and go left brain and have things everywhere, you know, all these ideas in my head or in a kind of--can translated to my workspace. So Unfortunately, that's probably another weakness of mine that I'm working on and have become better at, you know, small victories with being more organized. Like I said, I think it comes from being, you know, kind of a theater person or kind of crazy and, you know, having that kind of housing genius. And I call myself a genius, but that genius man said, works, is kind of like a perfect storm of stuff but like I said, I could translate into To disaster and workspace Subway, something that I'm working on."

I enjoy helping people solve problems. I enjoy working, collaboratively, a lot. I really Thrive when I am around people. So I really enjoy any type of position that allows me to either work with or around other people, I consider myself to be very responsible, especially in The workplace, I take my work, very seriously. I typically only really take on projects that I really enjoy doing and know that I can do well and I feel like that's a really good asset in myself that I know kind of where my limits are and I know when to pass the buck onto somebody who might be able to do a better job than I can. I-i'm a self-aware person I which kind of ties into the last piece as I feel like I know I do well, I know what I bring to the table in each given project or assignment and I'm not afraid to ask for help, I'm not afraid to admit when I don't know something and I again I just I like to be a team player, I like to be able to work with other people as far as weaknesses as an employee. I will say that I tend to get really caught up in one particular project. And I really want to see that thing through till the End. And so if I have several projects going on, I can have a difficult time, jumping back and forth really quickly. I definitely am able to do it, but sometimes it takes me a little bit of extra time or effort to really be able to mentally switch over because my brain just really wants to sit and Hyper fixate. Hyper focus on one particular project at a time. I would say another weakness that I might have is I enjoy when it's time to go home. I know when it's time to work, but I also know when it's time to cut that off and sometimes that doesn't Vibe super well with all employees or I'm sorry employers because some some companies, some employers, make a really big deal about, you know, your loyalty to company being based around how much of your life you're willing to commit to the job. I am here, I am dedicated. But I know when when my limit is and I'm I'm not afraid to stand up for that. And some Employers in the past have definitely seen that as a deficit in my employment, but I definitely know my limits."

I know she sure thinks so Mariah. She thinks I'm so funny as far as what everybody else thinks, I don't know about that. I know that she would describe me as caring and and kind and compassionate, she would describe me as somebody who, who loves to love loves to love, Love my projects and my people, and my pets and my ideas. I think she would describe me as responsible. There have been a lot of times that we have been each been able to be there for each other and I think for one more let's throw one more in. She'll say that I'm Dependable, you know, I especially when it comes to the people that I love people that I put time in. With I will do just about anything and be able to help them and love them and that's, that's really where I thrive. So I think that that is how my best friend would describe me."

I'm not, I don't Thrive as much in situations where I have to make snap decisions, particularly in like, a pressure-filled situation. However, if I have some time to sit back and take in the pros and cons and early, think my way through it, I have a very good Instinct for myself. I have made decisions like this in the past. I'm very specifically. I made a quite a change in my career, several years ago, I was working as a nanny and I was making a decent amount of money there. However, through that job, I ended up finding out more about kids with autism and I wanted to work with them and it really sparked an interest. I end up deciding that I'd be making a A little bit more money this way after everything was concerned that, I guess that really wasn't my main decision maker at the time, but I just remember that between several different jobs. I was able to sit down and and list make lists and and like I said, do a pros and cons and was able to come up with a decision at the end of the day."

I love joining new groups of people, even if they're kind of an already formed group, I love to come in. I'm typically kind of quiet at first as I'm feeling my way around, but that's really more. Just because I like to take in what's happening around me, kind of feel out the, the energy of the room feel out. You know, maybe stronger personalities or more more timid personalities and kind of get a feel for what everybody in the room or in the group is like like and then I feel like from there I can come in with whatever I have deemed my strength might be in the situation and put those forward because sometimes what a group needs is a really strong leader and I can jump in and be that and what it sometimes, what a group needs is someone who will just sit back and and and you know, do do some of the background work and I'm okay doing that too. So I really love being able to play this part. I feel like it's a strength that I have. Is kind of being able to chameleon my way through a professional project or group environment. And I think that that's just, it's a lot of who I am. I'm the same way in Social settings outside of work that I just kind of like to sit back and assess before I make any strong decisions about how much of myself to let out at a time or what parts of myself might be the most beneficial in any situation. So, So that just kind of bleeds over into my work life too."

When somebody annoys me, I think it's kind of difficult for them to tell. I tend to be very You know, it was specifically in the workplace, I don't feel like it's necessarily appropriate to show you. No, such a personal, like a private intimate kind of feeling about somebody and so especially in the workplace I'm able to just kind of show and I don't, I don't generally feel like people are able to tell because it's just not that important. If I'm annoyed with somebody I can I can take it home, not necessarily take it home with me. Like it's not like it continues to bother me but I Can just kind of it's his personal as private, you know, I don't need to to bother other people with that. So I tend to be more private about my annoyances with other people."

I have a system that works for me, and it doesn't necessarily make sense to anybody on the outside looking in, but it definitely makes sense to me. And I am able to get a lot of work done, when I'm able to organize in a way that works for my brain. So I'll have little piles around my desk. It's not that it's messy. It's not like I keep food at my desk or let things get dirty. S'more just that my organization methods are very specific to how things work for me, it's just how I've always been. I have tried a lot of different ways to organize based around what other people tell me to do, or what people told me works for them. Nothing really works for me. So I think I just March to the beat of my own drummer, in how I'm able to organize my things, but it works for me and it relatively stays in that, like, Baseline level. I don't like it to be. B, I don't like a mess. I do like order. It is just I like my own personal brand of order."

Typically, I'm considered by my peers by others has very motivating and ready to conduct work. For the most part, I feel that There's a lot that I provide, in terms of T motivation, getting people, focus on their work. Providing a good environment where people feel it's okay to speak up and be constructive towards whatever problem they encounter, or whatever. Probably group encounters is a home and overall, I think I'm very, very open and people find it easier to Talk to me regarding many issues, that's the case.

How much money I was making etcetera. I feel that I behaved very respectfully and rationally. In a lot of these situations from my prior work experience. I remember having good relationships with the managers. We're very friendly, very respectable. And when I have requests or wanted certain things or wanted to bring some things to their attention, they were very very open and ready to take in whatever request I had and especially when it came to terms of me leaving they're also very respectful with minor last minute changes in all that. And I was Because of this relationship and I was very comfortable being open to them about the reasonings about the timings of things about son, slight changes here and there and I feel that because they were our, we had already established a good relation with ourselves that that level of communication was able to be as good as it was."

Very recently, this past, fall my mindset, when joining new groups, what I feel going in is equal levels of excitement and anxiety because it's these are going to be the group of people that are good. Essentially, be your semifreddo Friends and more importantly Partners throughout an extended period of time where we'll try to be achieving a goal and how I act, I really am always very friendly and the excitement part usually perseveres. And I'm very happy to meet new people. Figure out, you know, the strengths weaknesses and also just getting to understand them. As people, I had two examples, one with an online completely online. Course about Ai, and another About software engineering class, and was able to establish good relationships, with each group and many of the members, we're always friendly to each other. When we got two working, things were very cordial and also casual, at the same time, it wasn't crazy stunts, super, super strict or scary, but I feel that because I have such good social skills in the open. I'm very friendly, I can establish good communication with others and also make things very enjoyable."

What one person is a 92 can be very subjective but there's obviously a lot of objectives things as well, factors to think back of a Moses more recent ish situation. During those cases, I usually try to act I'm always respectful for the most part. If it's somebody I don't know. Or it's a, it's a professional environment. I just Behavior normally very content with everything. Try not to escalate anything. I feel that the type of person I am in these environments and in general, try not to egg on any kind of attempt to escalate the situation for the most part. I don't think that is constructive of feeding in into a bad habit and To think of semi recent example.

There's been a lot of Shifting and Changes in my setup situation and I usually like to have my workspaces or areas organized a fair amount and also just being generally clean and not so messy. Typically, I'm sort of in like the middle ground where I'll have a good amount that's clean and whatnot, organized neat. And the other part, I'll have useful things or not even useful for the most part. But just things around that I had used a bit ago or a while ago, still in their spots because they're not really affecting my workflow in any way where they are. But generally I'm more in the Middle Ground. I do strive and do enjoy the cleanliness and neatness Work, areas, sleeping areas, living areas, Etc, and always be on top of trying to get better at that, but I feel that were curious, do need to be clean, you know?

Strengths as an employee as my attention to detail, as well as communication skills and created creativity and Innovation. My greatest weaknesses is my shyness and my anxiety is towards that working and trying to build a sense of community and connection with other people. Apple. So, How I choose to work on this is by presenting as much as I can or participating in a lot of outside activities. Like if the company has like a get-together or a program day, I tried my best to participate so that way I can get myself out there and, you know, at least try to network with one person."

I am very motherly in a sense. She would also say, I'm very creative, she always comes to me for a fashion device or a life advice because I am very much an advocate for looking good and also self improvement. So, I she tells me all the time how she there are certain things in my characteristics that she really wants to implement it in her own and one of them is like knowing how to I guess evolve."

We do a lot of networking events where we meet people from really big companies like Google Amazon and such. And in these situations we are giving advice that we should put ourselves out there, ask as many questions as we can and find people that are in the know. Asia's that we want to be in and really build those connections. How I usually react in these situations. As I tried my best to try to get a one-to-one with the person, or at least put one question out there. So that way, they remember my face as well as add them on LinkedIn. So that way, I could say thank you for your time during the networking event and just really make myself memorable."

So that way we can kind of, I guess, advertise ourselves or like, you know, show our Shanks. And and a lot of teams I usually get along with some wit most people. Ah but usually there's one person that struggles to communicate their needs or struggles to communicate that they don't like to do something and I always try before the project starts to ask them. Hey how is your work ethic? Like how do you like to work? Do you like to have you know, step-by-step instructions or do you like to go on your own? And I also try to make account that it's good to keep a connection that I'm going to you know, come back. And ask them like do they need help? You know, have you been able to complete an assignment on your own?

There was a person that I was trying my best to communicate with them as much as I could as some like do you like this? You don't like this and they were trying to keep it as passive as possible, but I can tell that some other work like I would give him a compliment. Of course, to start. off with and then I would tell them like, you know, give them feedback and tell them like, hey, I don't think this is Entirely like perfect. I think you need to kind of revise it and go over it because we need more content. And I can tell from his body language, especially his voice that he was getting agitated and it was kind of a frustrating for me, because I asked to do a one-to-one with him and he, you know, he accepted it. But then, even during the 121, it was very Difficult to understand where his Viewpoint was and he was not open or like to the conversation after some time.

This doesn't happen to me often because I am very tedious about having organization and being able to go back and know where I'm going in a project or like, you know, at my desk I like to know where everything is. The only times I've caught myself kind of losing organization as if I have something personal going on in my life. And I my head is just not in the The work usually. During these times, I tried to refocus myself, because cleaning and organizing is actually one of my favorite things to do when I'm feeling very fatigued or brain foggy. It helps me feel like I did something productive. It's kind of like when people say when you're feeling low or down or Shadow depressed, that making her bed or doing a little something, Makes you feel productive and makes you feel a little bit better. I've definitely taken that into situation with work and being in my work spaces."

I don't see myself as somebody who is paid to do 40 hours worth of work. I see myself as somebody who has been hired to fulfill responsibilities and regardless of how long it takes to to handle all my responsibilities, I will get them done. I also tend to be the person who doesn't mind coming in earlier staying late if that's It is necessary and I'm happy to do. So I like I like being in a place of employment and I like knowing that I'm contributing and I also understand that that not everything that needs to be handled. And any particular job can always be handled Monday through Friday 9 to 5. My greatest weakness is probably my tendency to people please. I have been known to take on a little too. Much responsibility at times only because I don't want to let anybody down, but I also just want to make sure that things get done."

This drop. That is how I tend to handle situations with people who annoy me. I'm not going to get angry with them. I think most people who create an annoying Persona around themselves are not trying to be annoying. They're not consciously doing it.

So I learn about them as people for a little bit and then learn more about what the structure of the team is, what the day-to-day workflow is like, and most importantly, what I can do to help make the team more efficient. I think this is because I recognize that, you know, as my place as a new team member, I need to make sure that I am integrating well and efficiently. And that I'm not slowing down the team going to make instead making their jobs easier in addition to doing my job."

I mostly just see myself someone who shuts down, whether them kind of acting out. So, a lot of times I'll just, you know, try to keep cool and, you know, to them at Sea. Might seem like my answers are, like, little bit shorter, but I tend to recognize that annoyances, you know, usually not the byproduct of someone else but usually, for my own personality trait. So I try to, you know, I never lash out yell at someone or You know say something that they're being annoying or anything like that. I tend to just you know take the time to calm down breathe in still answer their questions. Still talk to them, maybe not as energetic as I usually do but you know I tried.

Usually that I have all sorted, out my computer play work, space itself. Can get pretty and organized just because I come home kind of dump, my trash. So this, so when my workspace, my workspace does usually stay pretty clean. I find these things happening, mostly whatever, you know, things get hectic with life, and I think it's because the first thing to kind of go for me, Whenever things get hectic is kind of more of my personal life except like, work life.

Like I did 37 years even though almost not interested in that particular job, always doing which was washing dishes and then becoming the supervisor or kitchen.

I feel satisfied knowing that I haven't left anything for anyone else or for maybe me the next day or anything like that. I like to make sure that everything is done and completed and I feel accomplished, and as far as weaknesses, I would say kind of within the same thing that I don't want to leave any I just basically, I don't like to see others upset, I don't like others to be disappointed. So I would want it to be an environment where everyone is happy. And that's not necessarily if you take into consideration, not necessarily something that can be done. You can't make everybody happy. So it's kind of like a situation where it's good because you want to help people, but it's bad because You can't satisfy everybody."

I will try my best. It doesn't always work with everybody but I will try my best. She's me too. Calm the situation down or anything. If I can at least be my best self in the situation. And then the other person can end up as the one that is constantly - and in sticks to it. But I'll never be the person that feeds into the negativity and allows it to take over the whole situation.

They Are compensated as much as they should be, but it's kind of a situation in which I know that with nursing. It's a pretty well-known thing that you're always guaranteed a job with her saying there's never going to be a situation in which you're struggling to find work and it's a very tiring job. And there is a lot of job fatigue from it. And like I said, I don't necessarily think they're compensated enough, but it's something that there's always a job available. And, you know, there could have been a situation in, which I decided I want to do something more creative or something. But it's just like in those situations You can't guarantee a job you kind of have to not luck out but somebody has to find you. Some people have to see your work and they have to love it and it has to be a thing that you kind of build up on versus this. You go to school, 23 years and you have a guaranteed career. So"

I wasn't very good socially with interacting people with people but I also didn't necessarily find that a team Was very effective, at least back when I was, you know, in school and stuff like that. I just like to do everything by myself, but over time now I am very open to being in a team, especially when the team works very well together. As I mentioned, the current career field that I'm in teamwork is like if you don't have it, It's all going to crash and burn basically Health Care in general. If you don't communicate with the doctor, if you don't communicate with the patient. If you don't communicate with the Social worker just stuff like that. If you don't have communication and you don't work as a team, it does not work, it just doesn't work. So but now that I've seen how effective a team can be when it does work. I'm very open to teamwork and a lot more than I used to be."

So my biggest responsibilities - taking vitals and checking on the patient. Cleaning them up, doing what they, you know, helping them with daily activities. It's like helping them eat. People can be very particular about their food, the nutrition. People aren't always going to give them what they want. Sometimes things are missing, sometimes, you know, and people sometimes can get carried away being in the hospital and start to become very lazy and start to kind of expect people to do everything for them and it gets very annoying because it's like, you know, I'm being paid Jade and I'm here to help you with your health care. And I'm not necessarily being paid to listen to you, get mad about how there were carrots in your food. And You didn't want them. So it gets very annoying, but I try to be very patient with people and I know that they're not feeling well so that could contribute. It doesn't necessarily mean that this is how they are all the time. But I just try to help them, try to find them replacements for things, you know, just try to help them the best that I can and keep calm the best that I can.

For example when people get their meals, I'm supposed to take their blood sugar so that I can notify the nurse and the nurse can give them insulin if they need, it can always find the blood sugar machines, they're missing. And it's a whole mess because they need to have their blood sugar taken with them a certain period of time after they start like that, typically before they start eating but like very quickly after they start eating if they do start. start, there's some people that will wait, but there's not very many people that all weight, so it becomes a whole Fiasco have to find things and it brings the nurses behind And it's not my fault. It says how typical is that of you? It's not my fault that it's happening, but As far as me, I try to stay very organized but so I try to keep an eye on them. I try to keep my things organized, but sometimes things happen and it's not really that big of a deal. So,"

I can tell like I'm intuitive so I can kind of tell him people aren't feeling well or when they're struggling. And so I've been able to advocate for people. So in the workplace I would actually be really good in human resources. Also, and probably, to some degree in managerial or training positions. I'm very good at talking to people and I'm a very good listener. So I really believe that that would be beneficial in the workplace and in other Arenas as well. But particularly in engagements were involves a lot of speaking or listening, I think one of my greatest This is, is the whole also, unfortunately being empathetic because sometimes I spend too much time talking to people and listening to them and they can end up getting me to do some of their work. I'm working on that and I'm trying to change the way I do that because I'm finding that's not working out for me. So, I think that there's empathy and then there's, you know, degrees of empathy and I need to just have like a degree of empathy that's more normative. So I think I would be really good in the workplace. I think that I would be beneficial and overall it is because of my empathy, it's my greatest strength."

As somebody who is very caring, empathetic kind, somebody who would put in Beyond a hundred percent is very reliable. Generally, I think my best friend would also to say that I am always there, like, I'm a fast respond. And I'm good at researching that I'm legally inclined that I'm artistic. But at the end of it all, they would really focus on that. I am kind. A lot of people say that I'm that I have a certain type of intelligence. They'll they actually say I'm intelligent and I highly intelligent and I think that I have a type of intelligence, emotional intelligence. So that's how my friends generally describe me. My best friend does describe me that way and I'm trying to think of anything else, that would be a pretty Description of of me from my friend."

And the reason I'm trying to think about that is because I'm on disability and so when I go out into the public, most people know that I'm on disability but it makes it challenging for me to answer this. I guess I would say overall, When I'm in public, I conduct myself in a manner. That I make sure that if there is a business transaction that I'm completing that I'm acting in accordance with how I would want to be viewed professionally. And so, if I'm in a situation that could affect my status, I try to keep my commentary kind of short to the point and but if I do give explanations, I try to make sure that those explanations are thought out in my mind before I'm actually express it and I have the ability to do that. Like, you have to sit back, give some time, take some time, don't rush and it really does help. And so I kind of conduct myself very carefully because and the reason that is why I think that is is because once you say too much, you can't bring certain things kind of ring that Bell. And so you want to make sure when you're talking that you think more and say less it's kind of like the whole measure twice cut once philosophy. I just feel like you need to be really careful because it can affect your financial future. It can affect your ability to get hired and it can affect your ability to have been just get a loan or credit, if somebody doesn't trust you."

And at times I would kind of sit back especially if it was a group project. Like we're it was something I was unfamiliar with, I didn't like that. So I would kind of leaned in on other people to do that likes a one-time incident. Speech class. We were given an example of being stuck on the moon and I felt really, really unprepared and actually, my whole team didn't make it on the moon. And so, I kind of leaned in the other people, but I do try still talk. But generally in a group when I'm assigned to a group project, people pull me in and want me to be like the leader of the group, and they kind of want me to do everything to. And so I have found that now with Our projects. I really, if I put into that position that I want to delegate and have other people doing some stuff because otherwise I don't want to end up doing the whole project like I'm not going to do that and it's somebody who wants a job. I'm not going to let allow like myself to do all the work but yes in general I end up being seen as a leader in the team and I end up being chosen to do the work. So, how do I behave? I'm usually now I'm kind of like kind of stand back and assess the situation, try to figure out what people are doing. And I try to do that because I want to make sure that I don't get put in a situation where I'm actually in that Dynamic where I'm taking care of everything. So it's a lot of work for me but it's kind of worth it. So I do a lot of assessment. I also can be a little bit more just a little bit more reclusive than I used to be. I used to be a little bit more to get in there and socialize but generally now I'm not doing them so and I think that's just again, it's self-preservation."

It takes a lot to annoy me, but when somebody pushes me to that limit, I usually I could say I'm in the car and I get annoyed by someone to traffic, I'll just say that's annoying. I don't really like that. You did that, I'll kind of talk it to myself talking through, I don't like that, that happen. So I try not to get like really frustrated and sometimes, I don't do that, sometimes I actually if it gets bad enough, then I will get frustrated and I might blow off some steam vent, you know. But it's still to myself and then I do a lot of thinking about what might be causing the problem, and I try to do conflict resolution. So I'll try to like, write a letter to the person if they're haven't bothered me or try to address the situation directly through text, or some sort of phone call or connection. I'm not the type of person to put stuff off. Why do I think that is? I think that is because I was one of the only people in my family that communicated And communicated directly. I was told that by a few people in my family and I'm just really into communication. I'm a sociology major and so I think that I actually think through stuff a lot people. I know. I mean I also believe it's just my nature to to Really process things. So I think that's why I'm reacting. In those situations also growing up in a situation that was really like say a bit tough on me. I believe that I my reaction it's more of one whom I haven't heard a lot of trauma. So my reaction is is somewhat a survival reaction."

It makes me not be able to think well so it's not very typical of me to have a disorganized disorganized workspace. I usually try to at least keep where I'm working. Like clean and have whatever I need, like, all all the stuff that I need to do whatever I'm doing. So I usually have like, if I'm writing notebook paper or at my computer, I like it to be as neat as possible. I think it's because it helps me keep stuff organized and my mind. So messy environment leads to a messy experience and completing work and that goes for like academic were Her work. I could just it goes for pretty much everything. So that's how I would. how I would characterize it, and I tend to be. Anxious if I if I don't have that going on or worried or kind of flustered. So I just wanted to add that"

So if I have a question, I will usually try to figure it out myself before I ask for help or Direction. So I don't require like a lot of micromanaging at the same time, I guess that could potentially be. A weakness if I add if I wait too long to ask for help sometimes I create more problems for myself than I would have. If I had just asked for help or feedback earlier. And another of my strengths is that I am very thorough and deliberate with what I do. I'm an intentional person just by nature and that extends to my work. So, I generally spend a lot of time looking at detail and I will complete what I start. Very thoughtfully."

I tend to be a big feeler so I make decisions based more on my feelings and my heart that I do like logic or rationality, a lot of the time she would say that I am a very empathic person. I'm a therapist by trade and so I'm voting both trained to and naturally tend to think a lot about like what other people are going through and why they're doing the things they're doing I she would describe me as self-aware. I spend a lot of time thinking about why I do the things I do and why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling. I think she would say that I'm a crier.

But I wanted a raise If I wanted a more livable salary and unfortunately, at in the profession that I'm in, you kind of have to be in a supervisory position to get a livable wage. I wasn't really planning on on moving into management, but I took a risk doing that and affected, I guess, both my status at the agency, becoming a supervisor as well. Laz, my financial situation. so that In the, in these kinds of situations. I don't generally tend to be much of a risk taker, sometimes I maybe don't believe enough in myself. So it was kind of a departure for me that I actually did. Go for the supervisor position."

I just don't feel as comfortable being like talkative and outgoing and a larger group of people, I would say my Max sort of comfort for a team would be like, six people I would prefer maybe a team of like, for But usually in the beginning at least I'm going to be more one of them more quiet people on the team probably until I feel out. Everyone's personalities and the group dynamic, and until I feel more comfortable in my environment."

I really don't like confrontation. So I typically will kind of smile and Nod type of thing. If the interaction continues and I'm beginning and I'm continuing to feel annoyed that I'm much more likely to kind of just shut down. Mentally, check out. and I will get probably much more quiet and we'll just kind of Not really do much engaging or interacting to sort of escape the situation. If I can't escape it literally, then I'll Escape it mentally. I think that I behave that way because I have been conditioned to think that it's improper to maintain boundaries when I'm feeling annoyed or frustrated by someone.

So that's really symmetrically organized or arranged. And that just helps me like, it makes me feel more clear mentally if my work or work space, we're not organized.

So, whatever I can do to facilitate that even though we're all equal as team members, if I can step up and help everyone begin to get more comfortable with each other as individuals, I will do what I can to break the ice and I will do what I can to help people feel that I'm someone that can talk to someone that can trust.

We don't always know the kind of day that someone is having. We don't know their life and their experiences and what they brought with them into the workplace or in to whatever environment I'm in. So I try to take a breath for First and foremost, and remind myself that this person has their own story and whatever they are going through. I should treat them with compassion and understanding as much as possible. If I react poorly in a situation like that, it's not going to do anything positive for either one of us. So I will always try to put myself in their shoes, see where they're coming from, and understand why, I might be annoyed with them. What I might have brought into the situation that day, maybe I'm having a bad day, maybe they don't know where I'm coming from. So I think just to breathe, remember that we're all human and do our best to treat people the way we want to be treated. That's always going to make a big difference for me."

I think it's important for me to know where everything is. I have a system, and I'm definitely a creature of habit. So when I get started to work for the day, I want to know where to find everything. I want to know that everything is going to proceed as planned. And of course, there are always things that happen that don't go as planned. And but I do my best to see that I can get my workday started without a hitch. So everything in its place, at the end of the day, I clean up, get everything nice and neat so I can show up the next day get started and feel that I'm in that same organized, calm environment and that's important to me. Because that shows that I have a commitment to bringing my best self to the workplace, and to doing the best job, I possibly can without distractions, or without having to look for things in a marriage. Messy environment."

My problem solving skills are one of my biggest strong points as well as my level of motivation. When I do something that I really enjoy, or that I'm passionate about, I tend to really dig deep into it, and try to constantly improve, I think, as an employee, I can bring to the table. A lot of good leadership qualities as well as good teamwork qualities. Because in order, Her to be a good leader. You have to be a good member of a team. I think that Being hard-working, being open to trying new things and being willing to go above and beyond are all very important things that I could bring to the table as an employee. I think. passion is a very important thing as an employee to bring to the table, because if you don't believe in what you're working on or you're not really fully invested into it, you're not going to get the same results as if you were to really love what you're doing. Not even necessarily love what you're doing but just Feel a certain level of inspiration and motivation towards doing that thing and constantly being better at it. Sorry about that, there's like a little dot on my webcam but generally I would say that I think just being willing to do the work willing to learn learning quickly as well and learning, while doing the work in addition to all of All of that. Also I think all of those are great things that I could bring to the table as an employee."

Or share, your enthusiasm with you. If you just did something and you excited about it or really happy about something that happened in your life. I think that having a good friend who's going to be happy for you rather than be jealous or be, you know, whatever the case, I think sharing your happiness and also being there for you, maybe when you need Some support emotionally mentally even financially anything like that. I think that those are good qualities as a friend to have and I think that majority of my friends would say that I'm a good listener and that a lot of times I think people appreciate when somebody's a good listener because it really gives them. A stage to to vent and things like that. And everybody needs that in some form or another in their life. Whether it's a friend, whether it's a psychologist or something, whether it's family members, whatever the case may be, it's always good to have somebody there who has an ear for you, and I think that that's something that a lot of friends. Will appreciate and I think that that's one of the biggest things that any of my friends would say about me is that I listen to them. I'm not just sitting there waiting on my turn to talk. I'm good at paying attention and being observant with how they feel and what they're thinking and everything like that and really just spend quality time with friends."

I feel like something like that requires more attention and effort. I mean, you should always Is give your best effort but you should really kind of slow down and really take it step by step and try to make each decision in each action that you take count. I think that's just because of the nature of a situation like that being so important to your future to your present, you know, like just from a survival aspect as humans. I feel like we tend to do what's in our best interest and in our best nature, whether that's sometimes acting selfishly. Or sometimes acting, you know, doing what we have to do to get things done. So I think that just the aspect of trying to thrive and survive is going to fuel you to make the decisions that you make in crunch time. So to speak. I think that those type of situations such as like getting into some type of Some type of like, what's it called negotiation or something like that. Something like a negotiation, the way that you approach it in the way that you handle. It could be the difference between you thriving, or you getting nothing at all. So I think there's an importance in sometimes slowing down and taking your time and really thinking things through"

Get to know everybody, show them that I care and I want to put an effort forward in order to just improve the overall team aspect for everybody and I think over time you kind of develop more personal relationships with people and things like that. But in the meantime you just kind of got to spend a little bit of time together for The a relationship to organically cultivate, and I think that goes with anything. Some people are a little bit more of ice breakers and they come into the room and they just start the conversations. Some people are more temperate, in their personality and tend to be more reserved and quiet but then maybe open up more as they meet more people and get more of a Rapport with them. So I'd say that's probably more like myself."

So you got to kind of try to communicate with them and just tell him what it is. That's bothering you. And sometimes it's something that neither of you can control. Sometimes it's something that you're just going to have to tolerate other times. It's something that you can get to the bottom of and resolve with the individual that's annoying. You other times if you're able to sometimes you just have to stay away from that person, sometimes a lot of times in business or in, Life in general, there's times where you're unable to completely avoid something. So I think that you just need to be nice and also speak your mind and speak your heart without being too Brash about it. I think that you know, if you express your emotions to people, usually if you do it in a respectful and kind way people are usually willing to They're usually willing to kind of help with that, they're usually not going to clash against you just for the sake of being a contrarian. Usually if it's something that they a lot of times when people will annoy you, they're not exactly sure. What it is that they're doing, they're not aware of it. So that communication I think is just a very key aspect in anything in life for people to get along and do things well together, you're going to have To communicate."

There's been occasions where things do get disorganized, and I usually try to take time when I'm not working in order to get those things organized, because they really do. Make things run a lot smoother with things being organized. During your work day, I really believe that. A messy workplace kind of symbolizes a messy mind, like a cluttered mind. And I think that in order to really operate at your best, everything kind of needs to have a place, a designated place, there has to be organization in order for things to work in unison. Otherwise, things are going to be in the way of other things, and you might need to find something, you're not going to know where to look for it. I think that the work space can tend to get cluttered or messy. When you get swamped or overwhelmed in your work and you don't take the time to do the little routine maintenance that you need to do whether it's every day or once a week or whatever the case rather than saving up all of that. Clutter for that one time to do, spring cleaning or whatever. Clean up a little bit at a time. So you don't get a big message just little messes to get cleaned up here and there along the way. I think that I usually don't really have that issue because it bothers a part of me to see things in disarray."

If I put my mind to something, I will get it done, no matter how long it takes or how much effort is involved. My resilience and getting tasks does definitely a strength of mine that has been noted by people. I've worked with in the past, what if I weaknesses might be time management? So even though I will get a task done, I might not Be able to. Track my time as effectively as I would like to either because of pressed procrastination or wanted to make sure everything's perfect that I will take too long before handing something in. So deadlines are really helpful for me to be able to avoid that."

If I see someone standing alone, I'm going to go over and talk to them and make sure they feel included because I myself know how it feels to be on the outside. So I also don't have a lot of Shame when it comes to things like that, really care what other people. People think I'm going to do what I want and not really follow the status quo. If I feel as though it's an authentic to who I am, I'd like to think that I am funny and engaging and a good listener. I try to keep myself open to people's opinions and give. Everyone's thoughts and feelings of fair chance, because I know that I'm not always right. So, why would I act that way? Because we're all just human. And I like to think I give everyone a fair chance."

I decided to leave my first job after college because I wasn't happy. And I moved abroad for a year teaching English kind of living paycheck to paycheck. And then when I came home, I decided to go back to graduate school, so that was an expensive decision in and of itself, but I knew That would lead me to a happier career. So I typically behave on Emotional Instinct. Knowing what is going to make me happy in the long run, even if I'm having to sacrifice time, finances comfort, you know, having to move away having to try something new. So I'd rather put myself out of my comfort zone in terms of a professional decision. If it's going to lead me in the right direction."

In my class there were about forty five of us and For a long time I think I was thought of, as kind of like the mascot of class that if someone needed something and they didn't know who to ask, they could ask me. I was elected as the representative of our class because I do think I was easy to talk to and went out of my way to meet new people. And I think I behave that way. Because I know that a lot of people don't want to be that person and I like being that person that other people can depend on. And again, I don't really care what other people think. So if I have a question I'm sure everyone else does too and I don't mind being the one asking so yeah."

But if someone is displaying a behavior or doing something that is upsetting to me or feels defensive or is bothering me to a greater extent, then usual, I will try to pull them aside and talk to them about it. None a defensively because I know this is a really hard conversation. So I try to focus on how I'm feeling. Instead of saying, you know, you're doing this, you're doing that, you know, when this happens it makes me feel this way. Because I know that's how I'd want to be approached in a situation and I wouldn't want someone talking about me behind my back. I'd rather them come and talk to me. So, I just how I try to approach that, you know, treat people the way that you want to be treated."

Messy desk is a full mind. What is a clean desk? Say about your mind? Something like that. And I think as long as your workspace works for you and you're not sharing it with a bunch of other people and cluttering up a shared space, then it's okay. I always say that I know where everything is that I need even if not everyone else does I'm very organized when it comes to my computer, my files, my back, everything up, I have folders that, I make sure to organize and code with names, and I should back everything up on Google Drive and Apple iCloud. So, I think the term organization means something different to everyone. But if you can find what you need quickly, and Not lose important documents then I think you're okay."

I have a good rapport with my team and my greatest weakness is probably too meticulous. Some being criticized as a perfectionist, I like my work to be very high up on the raise the bar very high and expect my employees to meet my my high standards. so that's probably a weakness that I'm guilty of but not necessarily embarrassed about"

During various times, when I made professional decisions that affected my my status, as well as my, how much money I made the first time was shortly after college and entering the workforce. I think I was at my first job for maybe a little over a year. And I really found that I had reached, as far as I could go with that particular job and decided that it's in my family's best interest and in my own to leave the company and try Another job. So when I made a professional decision, that affected my status, or how much money I made, it was usually to leave a company for a better position. One that I would make more money at and this is basically because by nature and outgoing person, I haven't personality we're pretty aggressive and my characteristics like And characteristics are such that I'm a go-getter. I don't like to just sit back and relax and take things for granted get into a rut, or into a groove or Into a routine where a little cup very comfortable. And I don't want to take any chances or try to improve myself. Change is inevitable. So I tried to get ahead of the curve, so to speak.

I don't want to hurt the team. I don't want to insult anyone to step on anyone's Toes or backstab. I want to be accepted as another person on the team and enjoy the same benefits and trust that everyone on the team already enjoy it.

I would consider is difficult because as one of the one of the leaders I know that trust is a Paramount but unfortunately sometimes things change in our end or for some reason, I Didn't know about earlier, so I can't deliver everything as promised so, so I do have to weigh the ins and outs of things, whenever I make it difficult decisions.

Making sure. I understand what I can and cannot change and knowing how to ask for help from my own team members, or manager and just taking things one step at a time. So I think I tend to be very warm with everyone. I work with several group projects and just some people might team weren't getting along so I spoke to them about it and ask them what's wrong?

Basically, I've worked for in production, for FedEx Kinkos. Back in the day, other FedEx office now or something. Basically, we had, I mean, very high volume expensive. You know, different different things to do for these companies like large large presentations. And if I didn't get that right, I wouldn't get a bonus and more importantly, the customer would not come back and they're spending twenty thousand dollars like literally presentations. So it's 100% vital to get all that stuff done. And and, You know it's a status thing too. It's like you need to be able to be trusted as project manager to talk.

So you can learn a lot from people that have been there longer than you have. I think the reason that I do that is it's a more effective way than to constantly be bothering someone like, Hey, how do I do this? How do I do this? It's like one you use your brain, you think? You know, how how do I solve this problem without having to involve somebody and then throughout the course of the week or whatever?

Okay, one of my greatest strengths would be that 15 years old. I'm not a child. I've been in the workforce for many years, I've done everything. I've worked at Ford Motor Company, I've done computer repair for over 20 years. I don't actually do any computer programming or anything of that sort, but I can run around on any operating system. I get a little bit of Linux and command prompt stuff like that. I've also reprogrammed Android's new operating systems unlocked this nature as far. Like I don't know. See that's one of the problems I keep running into you right now. Like little over a year ago I had kidney problems that had me taken chemotherapy this is not really do with anything other than it's been hard to get back into the workforce. Since I went through all the hospitalization and all this kind of stuff, it just kind of made my life turned upside down so anymore, just any old jobs, not going to do, I guess. Is the simplest way to put it anymore. I kind of feel like a job as a means to an end. And it's not a career, it's nothing that I want to, you know, do for the rest of my days in. Something you go to get a paycheck and you come home, and that's the end of it. So I really don't know that. Honestly, this, if it was an actual real anything, That anybody would be pleased with me or even want me because you know I added to probably not the greatest after going through Gmail and getting back into regular life it's just kind of jarring to say the least. I don't really know that I've got anything else to add to that, so you know, some strength, some weaknesses or weak strength that I've got h on my side and experience that counts."

That's kind of a loaded question. As I said, the last thing, I'm 50 years old, I only really have one or two good friends left. I really don't know what my friends say to me. We never really sat around and asked each other. Yeah. How would you sighs me up as afraid to this is generally not something into to each other. I guess they would say, I'm a man of my word, I keep my word. I make my word. It's gold, it's solid, it's unbreakable. So if I make a promise to you, it's going to be done. If I say it's going to be done, it's dull. I really don't under I don't really know what they're trying to get out of me here. So, Talk a lot on the phone. I know this really doesn't have anything to do with me being friends with anybody that I'm always there when you need me. And I can also be a giant pain in the butt.

Well, one time I was managing a TV shop and when I came into the shop, they weren't doing very well. Now, I'm not really sure why Like I couldn't even, you know, speculate that management before. Whatever the case may be. Let's see as far as anything goes. Like I rallied all my workers together which at the time I only have like three. So I had one TV repairman, I had one VCR repair man and then I had myself which was also doing vacuum repair as well as a little bit of VCR repaired stuff. So I gathered us all together and I had my workers to come in after hours instead of so that we could actually catch up things in the store, get Old Stock moves, that we can generate some revenue for the business. And of course this benefit on this all because you know every time something God fixed, we were able to, you know, pay my workers, you know, generates more money for the shop. So I don't know that there's a usual way to behave with these situations but we were able to we together. We're able to bring shop back from bankruptcy and actually - thriving businesses as well as moving all stock out of the store, getting it repaired and getting it out of there. Because when I first came into the store been, there was TV stacked up along the walls when you'd walk in and everything a quite the mess. This braid stepping into this position believe because the thing was about to go under anyway but yeah, we brought it back, you know, ultimately the owner ended up, taking it back over and probably flush it right back down the toilet. The same week he had been while I was there. We brought it back. Let's see. Characteristics that were involved. There wasn't really any characteristics other than just I took Charge, it did, what needed to be done. That simple money needed to be brought in and quickly and I need it by workers to be in there, you know, fixing my product, getting them out the door. So that's what we did adjectives. To describe my personality when I was managing I was a hard-ass. Just like total what I needed to have done and I didn't give them any squirm room to get it done now. Lead role, you know, and they were on it and we've all worked together and we got it done. So that's it."

Number 4, it says think of the situations when you join a new team of people, how do you usually behave when you enter a new team? And why do you think that this? Well, it's been a while since I've actually been in any kind of a job where I was working with a team at last job. Calm Healthcare, which I can for several years. One lady in particular I was with her for many years. The only thing that I can really think back to is again, when I was managing when I I don't have a typical way, I think, any particular situation, Isis situation. If I need to sit back and listen, then I do need to take charge, then I do, I need to pretend, I even know what I'm doing, then I do, I try to be whatever it is. They need me to be, that's why they're paying me. So I just try to do my best, whatever situation they kept putting like one job. I was working Avery Dennison. They could have was shuffling me around, you know, to all the different parts of the factory so that I could actually learn all the different positions, which was not normal. So, every time I got the introduced a new team of people, I just kind of kept my mouth shut most of the time and you know, was sitting back and learning. And after I, you know, learned every one of the positions at the plant, apparently this is the funny part of this not that it has anything to do with anything but I ended up getting blackballed out of the job because I had actually learned a little too much scared. Some of the management into thinking I was going to take their jobs. So that's that's all I gotta say about that."

Okay how do you usually react in situations wine? Easy. That is when someone has annoyed. I'm kind of a fight or flight is what I typically I will look at the scenario and if it's something that warrants a fight, I will, and if it's something that warrants running away in some situations, it's better to run off and put your fist up. You know, as far as said Pick and choose your battles. The reason that I think this way is because through life experience, I found that battling people is not always the best. That's like, is the fight-or-flight, you know, a lot of times I tend to run away from people who want to fight from, you know, with me to me whatever because I'm not inclined nor am I interested necessary then, you know, jokingly told police"

And what do you think that is? I got a thing that I call organized chaos. The way I kind of do things, they have to be in some kind of order. I do not like clutter and I don't like, Sure. And it lessens something that I've ordered in a cluster way. I don't know how else to explain that other than yeah, I can't be pretty meticulous. Things have to be a certain way, I don't know. That's just how I. So there is never going to be a situation where my workspace is not going to be in some sort of organized, whatever, even if it looks chaotic to somebody else, I'm going to know where everything is. and the reason that I tend to be that way is because I've always been that way ever since I was little"

I typically look at the pros and cons of each aspect of the decision to make sure that that decision is going to be a benefit to me and my family, I would consider taking a different position. If there was a substantial increase in Pay. However, I would also have to look at the consequences in terms of time away from my family and and also the amount of stress that I would be under if I accepted that position. And so I guess I just do a cost-benefit analysis and look at each side and try to make the best decision based on my individual situation."

Exploit those I don't that sounds manipulative, but I guess just try to emphasize the similarities in lifestyle and background, whatever interests so that I can use this commonalities to build a bridge with the other members of the team.

I think you're either born with the trade of being organized and orderly and able to keep things in order or you're not. And I definitely was not born with the trait and it doesn't come to me easily. So what I typically try to do is to straighten up my workspace at the end of the day or if that fails to at least do it every couple of days and I generally will spend about half an hour going through all the papers on my desk, eliminating things that I don't need and completing tasks that need to be done to get rid of that paperwork on my desk. So I just think it comes naturally to some people to be organized and for some people it Doesn't. And so you really if you don't have that Gene or that disposition, you have to make a big effort to remain organized."

I'm a very like soft-spoken person and I generally will have ideas and I will be too afraid or something to put them out there, so I'm hoping that something I can change in the like Team friendly work environment, and so on. that way I can acquire the skills that I'm lacking for right now, aside from that another strength I would have is probably be being able to manage many different things at once.

They would most likely say that I'm always there for them and I'm a good support system that no matter like, when if things get a really difficult kind of, I kind of like, stick it out with them and help them through it.

But also, the employee doesn't feel like I'm just shrugging her off and just making things right with the customer. So, I tried to make a Standing until the employee that oh Pop possibly or whatever. We like they thought they said that but in reality, you know, they said what you wrote down, and that's what they got, which is fine, we could just make it for them again, get them what they want and I will, we'll just go about it, that way, that way there's no harm, no foul the The employee knows that I agree with her that she wrote down the correct thing and the customer just gets the item that they originally wanted. I think it's probably the best course of action because especially in situations like that down the line, you don't want no ill-will or bad feelings for one another. So it's pretty good."

I recently skipped, filling in the Q3 review altogether, because I was busy with other more, interesting things, and Yes, if you are good at your work, then a special accommodation is that companies were named.

And then, You know, just as soon as you get the opportunity, he the one piece by piece and, you know, get yourself together and then you can start back over. The next thing is we do have like automatic vacuum. So you know, we don't have to worry about the hair so much but usually you know I just try to keep myself in order because without that order actually, in the industry that I am in, it gets very hard to do your job.

I can go into numerous situations and usually figure out what's going on and how to do it and what the potential best path forward is I think that I'm in general pretty intuitive when it comes to problems or questions by that. I mean if a higher up or somebody signs of your project I can usually figure Figure out what they mean. And I'm also usually able to figure out a effective way to go about it. I also do better with General guidelines rather than specific guidelines. And by that, I mean, If you tell me how to do something explicitly, I can do it that way but if you give me a little more freedom to figure out a better way to do it, usually I can do come up with a faster process or do it in a better more efficient way. In my opinion, as far as weaknesses go sometimes I can get a little bogged down in the minutia sometimes. Sometimes I get to a part in project and I might get distracted or let a small portion of it overshadow. Maybe the larger goal and along those same lines. Sometimes I have a tendency to be a little bit.Stuck in a certain mindset that can happen. Those are my greatest strengths and weaknesses in my opinion. Thank you."

You're wrong. Or any of that stuff, doesn't mean that I can't work with you. I don't even have to like you to work with you or be around you, that's something different.

I think that my personality in that manner was one, I was seeking some type of stability and familiarity, which is why I was tempted to stay at the company that I had worked at, but ultimately my desire for not being stuck in a situation that I didn't want to be in drove me to force myself to change. So I guess the overall personality traits in those situations are one like I want stability, I want familiarity but at the same point, it should not my personality is one that I don't necessarily want that to cost me things in the future. Why do I think that happens? I think I've always been that way. I don't think that I think that comes through and how I generally work and how I generally behave and I would generally go about my business and for the most part I generally Look for the best quickest path forward while doing a fishing, good job and I think that flows into most of my life. Thank you."

I will say, I have a set team that I work with most of the time, but I will work with outside teams. When I get assigned, a new project and those teams are generally different, every time and the time varies from a few weeks, to several months to almost a year in general. And I come into a new team. I try to be friendly and open eye. want to be helpful and put forward, a Parents that I want to be a team player, but I'm also independent and want to not afraid to ask questions and understand the project and do that stuff. Why do I do that? Why do I approach it that way? I think trying to cultivate a friendship, not necessarily friendship by working relationship with new people is super important because if you do not have something There other than just, I have to work with this person. Sometimes when you need something, they may be slow to answer or maybe hesitant. So if you have a good working relationship in general, people will want to help you. And I try to think that way when people ask me questions and I expect the same back, I also think that being truthful Is important and I expect the same thing. That doesn't mean being mean or saying down putting somebody down if something comes up, but it means Telling the truth. If you have an opinion, say if you think there's a better way to do it, say it. And I think that way because they've been doing similar type stuff for several years now. And I think that I find that to be that leads to a better working relationship with and that means that projects generally get done faster and more efficiently and more correctly. Thank you."

I think that I view that as a strength this person would, Usually come across as condescending in general. I tried to just ignore it and move forward because it wasn't a long-term thing. So I was like, I have to work with this guy. I got to deal with it. You know, there's a line that I'm not going to cross and I'll push back but there's no reason to make it a big. Something bigger than it is. And while I think it was, maybe not treating the people in the team properly. I think that also is his personality. I don't think he was doing it to be malicious. So overall, I just kind of force myself to find a way to work with them and I think I did that because I want to be a team player. I want to work, I want to get the project done and I want to have a longer term View and like I said earlier, and another question, I don't have to be your friend to work with you. I just have to figure out a way that we can move forward together without it being detrimental. So I always try to view things in. That mindset. Hopefully, that came across. Hopefully he I when I push back, I tried to push back in a polite manner because I also think it's important to not Let personal feelings enter business. So overall, that's how I handle that situation. Thank you."

I generally kind of like to work on numerous projects and when I say not organized, I have organization to it but it isn't highly organized. I might have a section of my desk. Be for one thing as sexual my desk for another thing. My Drawers. Generally, have history but they're not necessarily filed in, would like a very organized manner. This is always been the case for me. I won't say disorganized but I can allow myself to get cluttered and I usually am try to be conscious of how that is because it actually flows into even computers and how I store files on computers. I generally have to think things through and usually I set aside time either once a week or every now and then depending on the project or what it is to clean, hangs up both digitally and in real world, I think that is the case because I find that stuff kind of sometimes to be mundane and I enjoy the larger project, the larger harder questions, more than the mundane stuff. So I have to force myself to realize that If I do not organize things in a proper manner ahead of time, when I have a question later on in a long-term project, I might waste time on necessarily trying to sift through stuff that I shouldn't have to sit through. And unfortunately that was always been a personality trait of mine. Like I said, I just get distracted by. I just don't know distract his right word, but I get distracted by the project and the problem, and not necessarily the mundane tasks of making sure the work that I've done is organized and accessible and and, Repeatable. So, Unfortunately, it's pretty typical of me, but I find myself that I'm conscious of it and I work to improve it. Thank you."

I enjoy a good puzzle and so figuring out a way to do something. More efficient, sufficiently is not just Just something I'm capable of it is pretty much how I function, I always look for the way that something can be done that. It can be done in a standard way that it can be done in a Less painful manner, just because it's the way it's always been done, isn't the way that necessarily it's the best. Also, I understand that my way isn't the only way that everyone has a different way that they work, and that they may find it easier to get to the answer their way, than mine. My weakness is that I tend to think ahead and I don't always even myself know the 2 3 4 5. I seem to go from step one to step 6 and that is not always the best way to work as a team. I'm very very collaborative and I'm very willing to stop and go. Okay, here we go. Here we are. This is how I got there but it can feel as if I'm being a little pushy or that I am. Acting as if I am smarter or whatever. But it's just that my brain jumped there and and so that can be a weakness sometimes while I encourage everyone to work well and work well together, I can sometimes accidentally forget the part where I encourage them and bring them along."

I did a lot of managerial type of Duties but because I didn't have my degree it put a total stop to really moving forward and so, I finally decided that that wouldn't do and I and while money, I was making was good and the jobs I had, I was enjoying, I didn't like that. This one, one thing in my life, a choice I made at age 21 was having so much of an effect on what I Could do and where I could go. And so, I finally went back and got my degree and I'm very happy that I did, it gives me pleasure every single time that I can say that, I am a college graduate because I worked hard for it.

Fortunately, at a certain point in my career, landed in the contract world and between that and being a project manager meant that jobs working constantly ending, and which meant that I was constantly joining new teams of people. And luckily, I am good at that. We moved a lot as a kid. So I was always the new kid in school and so it's not a foreign experience to me. I enjoy getting to know people and their strengths and and how they can be used within a team and and how we can mingle and collaborate, so it was probably every two years or so that I joined new teams of people and, you know, some were incredibly successful, some of these people. I am Friends with to this day and I would work again with if I could in a heartbeat because they are amazing co-workers and collaborators other people. It was an interesting learning experience and not one either of us are probably looking to repeat. That's the nature of it and nature of life. But yeah, one of my the most Resting that I did was a position where I took place, took the place of someone who was going to be on maternity leave for a year because they were based in Scotland, it was for an international company. So my co-workers were in Scotland England. Germany, Ida hope. I had a couple in the same town but not many and said that was amazing. Getting to know people purely. Online and on the phone and working with them with different backgrounds, very different backgrounds, and how you worked and how you work together. Not to mention time differences.

I don't even Remember what it was so minor I think I look something up when she thought I should be working. She didn't realize that it was for work. She all she saw was me on the internet. I was in a position that that didn't matter. Anyway she wasn't my manager but it made her mad and so she tried to destroy me. Get me fired. She tried to give me a bad reputation. Luckily, I had an excellent reputation and people thought very well of me and her Sudden Change from promoting me as the best thing since sliced. Bread to being, you know, the worst thing since moldy bread was something that people expected of her and didn't believe. So it didn't destroy me, but it made me very wary of of situations like that. Unfortunately, took a little of my shine away of, you know, believing the best in people and and made me think that I should be more protective of myself and my reputation when were rumors, are that prevalent?

The only time my work isn't organized is if others are bringing work into my situation and I have to organize it to be part of mine, which is a project manager is an unusual, so it doesn't actually bother me that much. It's my job to pull it all together, my workspace. I'd say the one that comes to mind. In the most is worked in just once in one of those situations where you had no assigned seating, you had a little locker and then everybody was supposed to just grab whatever seat they grab. But human beings don't work well that way. And everyone tended to go for their, their comfort seat. You know, you always knew where to find people because everyone tried to go to the Is that they always go. This was a job that where a lot of people work from home long before it was a thing since covid. But this particular job, sort of let people do it on the regular. So it was not uncommon to see somebody walk up to what they consider their desk and see people stuff piled their and the look on their face. So it was very hard to be organized as a workspace because Cuz every single day you had to gather up all your stuff and shove it into your little Cheney Locker or take it home. And it was awkward. You just, you couldn't have the things that hand in the way that you wanted to be able to work, and I don't recommend it. But my workspace was not organized because they didn't give me a proper work space."

I don't love socializing. I don't want to be checking social media. I just want to do my work too. Complete it all and timely manner without you know sacrificing Perfection, getting everything done correctly. I'd say my biggest weakness as an employee is probably just the fact that sometimes I jump into a task without maybe identifying do one thing that is Is the most important. If a tent for the task includes, let's say, two or three objectives. Every once in a while, I may just start working towards us objectives without identifying. The one that really truly is the most important and that it's possible, I could be doing kind of some extra work. That didn't necessarily need to be done if I would have prioritized the number one top thing."

I will definitely keep going until things are as they should be. I typically do get what's right, if that makes sense.

And I believe that that also leads to doing a really good job at work. If you're not burnt out and you enjoy what you're doing and it's not taking physical or Or mental toll on you.

What might be the best ways to work with each individual person on the team and see how the team works as a whole. And immediately identify any ways that people might be clashing with each other, things like that. That is not something that I want to be a part of.

So, Pretty much typically if someone is being annoying that is a them problem and not so much. A me problem I think that I just tend to ignore them as much as I can if it were disruptive or something like that. Obviously I would have to take that higher. I don't know. Maybe in involve. Upper level or HR something I've never had to do that before. I think personally, it's best to really try not to give too much attention or energy to someone who is being annoying. The best you can do is just tell them, you know. No, I can't do that. Or please don't do that or don't speak. Talk to me that way or I'm not going to deal with that and that's just usually as far as I have needed to go."

So, First person in maybe needs to do something at that workstation for a couple of hours and then you come in and they have, you know, things just strewn all over the desk or what not typically. I keep everything completely organized. Not so much just because it's indicative of me as sort of a clean freak or anything like that. It's just at work. I don't really feel the need to sort of spread my personality around. I want to focus on work, get the work done, being organized, helps that but also I feel it's sort of a waste of energy to be kind of putting your personal stamp all over your space.

I ended, my sales, numbers are low. I get a very low bonus. So how do I behave in such situation?

I have developed relationships, I have developed client bases, right data leverage to basically make for the seals, and that has really helped me.

I recently had joined this organization where I'm currently working at in Consulting and I joined as a senior consultant, I joined the team of where there were other three senior consultants and there are a lot of other stuff. So initially when I joined the team, I was a bit apprehensive a bit nervous because some of the team members in the team was senior to me. They had some good experience about the project, they knew what is happening. They knew the clad well and they develop they develop the trust relationship with the client. I being knew was basically feeling a lot apprehensive and anxious of how I would deliver how I would yell. So what I did is I basically made a acquaintances with all my team members. I tried to sit down with them during lunch during coffee breaks. Try to learn more about them, try to learn more about the project we are working on, in, in that. Today we developed a relationship because I'm cable, right? Like both of us working in the same team and we were trying to make sure like the delivery that we do for the client is up to speed. So over time, I developed a good reputation with the team and the project was a success."

And someone around me is my current situation where my boss currently is very, very annoying. He is a micromanager like he wants to know details of everything that I'm doing where I'm spending, my time, why? I don't respond to him. If let's say things mate, 8 a.m. and I don't reply by 9:00 a.m., if im using something else, he'll start calling me saying, where is your response? Why are you not replying? So that wasn't really annoys me. I don't like that kind of managerial style where I have to constantly keep updating my boss, right? I'm used to a style where I have freedom to work, right? Mike the previous managers, all give you that kind of Freedom, that kind of responsibility, they trust with me. Write the current manager that I have does not trust me that much and he completely continuously rising. And it's not just me, my Piazza. Also meet the same comment like my current manager annoys them as well. So like what I do in such situations is I try to keep a calm head. I try to listen how to write and I try to do what is right. Sometimes my manager says oh you need to do this, do that. At in if I think okay, this does not do a lot of value at. I try to reason it out with him and if he understands it's okay, if it doesn't understand, I try to pack that thing for a few days. And then again, Reach Out seeing see this two days went by The Cars That You assigned me, right? Is not complete, but if you see there is no impact to it.

And my kitchen background was visible so that is not typical of me. I don't Like that kind of work space, right? I like a proper working desk, right? I need my monitors in front of me. I need my mouse next to me. The I need a notepad. I need a pen. Everything, right. But I'd been depending started. It was very difficult to do to get that kind of work space, right? We had to all of a sudden start working from home, and I did not had not planned for such an activity at home, right? So, I did not have a lot of space, so I was trying to utilize the space that I had, But as time passes, right?

I think generally for me it's important as an employee to understand the bigger picture. So that if I'm giving a or if I'm receiving a directive from my supervisor that I understand the reasons for that, I think that I'm pretty good at understanding the, the direction in which the company wants to take itself and how I can be a supportive part of that, I think it's important for me to be able to speak my mind in ways that are appropriate and productive. One of the things that I try to do is if I'm coming up to my my supervisor, I generally will have solutions to the concerns or problems that I have to be able to suggest as opposed to just coming in and saying this is a problem that somebody else needs to fix. For me. I think that I'm really good at thinking on my feet and being able to improvise with I needed. And I find myself to be someone who can motivate others and support others in achieving the goals of the company that I work for."

I don't, I don't get upset. I'm pretty low maintenance low drama, kind of sort of person, I think that's that's probably the best way that that I would be described. I am enthusiastic with things that I that I am. Enjoy and appreciate. I try not to be overly critical and I think they would describe me as being empathetic to those that are around me that I'm that I'm not just about myself that I look out for those that that I care about and that support me and that the hopefully that I can support them as well."

How much money that I make most of my jobs have been fixed income with some bonuses. I think it's really, really important to understand when making those decisions, what what the outcome of those decisions may affect. So that I think it's important for me to understand the whole picture. ER like I was talking about before and an additional you understand the ramifications in the impact that that's those decisions may have. I think that requires a lot of research and synthesizing information and data that comes to me. I try not to make decisions rat are irrationally or on the Fly. Sometimes it's necessary depending on the situation but if it's always best to seek out as much information, Information and support before making decisions that might have greater impact, not just on myself, but on the company that I work for, in the, the people that I that I either supervise or support. So it's important to get as much information I think as possible before making those decisions."

I'm trying to understand the Dynamics of that team and how I can best fit into that situation. I am not one to initially take charge or insist on doing things. The way that I feel that they should be done. I think it's really important to understand that the team dynamic MC as well as the the protocols procedures that I might not be familiar with. There might be decisions that are being made on a new team that I can absolutely provide input and support. But if I don't have a full picture of what's going on, I don't feel it's my place to come in and change everything right off the bat. So I think initially, it's very important to learn that. The team Dynamic understand, the ropes, the rules of the road, so to speak. And once I have a good understanding of what that looks like in terms of Team Dynamics, that's when I feel like I can be my best as far as providing leadership or support on that front or just being an active team member. I think it's important to understand perspectives from everybody but whether I'm brand new to a team or a team member that's been around for a long time that everybody's going to be have different experiences and different Different ideas which should be recognized and supported, but I think it's important also to make sure that that team Dynamic is recognized and understood before coming in and busting things up a little bit."

So I take care of a lot of customers who are dissatisfied with some of the things that have happened. Sometimes they do have legitimate complaints that would that we work through in address sometimes, their, their complaints are just more of a way to vent or or Express frustration. There are times that I I have gotten annoyed in those kinds of meetings and those kind of conversations, it's extremely important for me to understand and help empathize with those that are coming to me. We with these kinds of problems, that it might not necessarily be a frustration about the company or a particular employee, but, but something something else. And so it's important to listen and be an active listener. Not not be on the defensive and not, Try to to discount or demean those that are coming to me with those kinds of concerns that it's important for the for them to feel recognized for them to feel acknowledged and a solution B. Be presented or work through in a collaborative, sort of way, not just a dictatorial, sort of, this is what we're going to do for you. And if you don't like it, you can shut up. So it takes a lot of finesse and it with with input customers as well as employees. I have some some employees that I supervise that are that are kind of similar in that in that sense it's the the importance is to help them feel heard to be empathetic But ultimately to provide the supports needed through the policies procedures that are provided by that company.

I think that a workspace needs to be a an environment that is functional and not cluttered and not disorganized in the sense that you can't find what you're looking for my office. Currently, has I meet with a lot of clients, I meet with a lot of employees and the the location which we meet around my desk is quite I mean there are times though when I'm working on a project or something that requires a lot more room, I do have another workspace that I'll utilize, if I need a larger area to kind of spread things out on occasion, though, I will use my office and my desk is as kind of that, that larger sort of Cluttered workspace. So it's kind of I feel like a healthy, a healthy balance between making sure that my workspace is clean and organized to receive clients and employees that need to share information or if we're having meetings or those kind of things. But I also do feel like it shouldn't be sterile in the sense that it looks like it's a an office that that really doesn't have any. Final touches to it. Or looks like it hasn't. It's a space. That's not worked. And so I do feel like it should be utilized as a workspace and sometimes that requires a little bit more cluttered, but to make sure that that clutter is organized in a way that doesn't overtake that that office."

How do I behave in such a situation? And why do you think that is? I think, in this type of scenario might behave in a way that is proactive rather than reactive, obviously, nobody wants to be in a position that's going to detrimentally affect them.

And why do you think that is? So generally when I joined a new group of people, I tend to be a little reserved and shy at first, but once you get to know me, I'm very friendly. I think that this is because I am an introvert but I do have a lot of extroverted Tendencies.

I remember working on a project with some beers where we did not have a good plan in place of what we needed to do. And when we had to get things done by and I would say this is not really typical, we're usually pretty organized. I tend to be someone who likes to plan everything out in advance.

I would, I would be like, oh, it's kind of in that area and it would take me like a minute or 30 seconds to go find it, just because I don't really care to clean things up that much because I know if it's in this general area more, If not, I'll find it, sometimes I have misplaced things and they're gone forever. But most, most of the time, it does not affect me. And I go through the work day, no problem."

I like, when new situations come up, where I have to learn new things. So that's really one of my big strengths. I like to learn new things and I'm not afraid to try new things and I'm not afraid of change. Weaknesses. Let's see. What would be my weakness as employ me. I guess I tend to be. More interested in. High-energy atmosphere. So if something is too regular to quiet for long periods of time, I could get a little bored especially if I feel like I'm not really learning something new or trying new things or working successfully with other people to bring in new ideas."

Also I tend to be someone who can be a little quiet but that's mainly because I like listening. I like to listen to people stories, new ideas, things like that. What else? My best friend would probably also say that. I am caring because I do like to listen to them and help with problems that they have whether it be emotionally professionally, relationship-wise."

I usually behave in these situations by thinking things through a lot. If I have the time I tried to spend a nice amount of time, sort of pros and cons doing a lot of research, if I don't. Not have as much time I still like to think things through but I also don't like to drag things out. So I really do a lot of research, ask questions with other people and advice to really figure out what would be the best choice. I think I do this, because I don't want to take too long to make a decision decision, like I don't want to get stuck but I also don't want to make a decision right away in case I miss something. So I'm very focused on seeing all the angles, seeing all the options, seeing all the opportunities and then, weighing that in my future endeavors and see how something works out for me. In the end, I like to forecast to try to get Make the best decision. I possibly could."

But again, I listened a lot. So I'm usually finding my way around getting to understand people their personalities. What they're interested in and usually I Like to understand people sense of humor because I feel like that is how I usually get across to people. I like to make people laugh and I like to make people feel comfortable. So I start off pretty quiet but then eyes usually begin with. Jokes quick jokes. I like to. Be observant of things, make people laugh, and then sort of find what we have in common because I feel I do this because I feel like it's very important to connect with the people that you work with, whether this is like a team for work. A team for school, something along those lines. It just makes Work easier makes the day go by easier. It's helps people understand each other and we get more work done and where Works successfully done."

I don't really don't have an initial reaction because I don't want to get ahead of myself and make assumptions. So usually I'm trying to think of the best way to respond to them to keep. I don't know the conversation going perhaps. They were asking me for help but they were rude. I want to focus on what it is that we're trying to solve. So I try to put myself and their shoes, try to understand where they're coming from because I'm sure there are times where I've been rude to somebody when I didn't mean to be rude to them. Or I was having a bad day or something. And I would feel really bad about it afterwards because I didn't mean it. And I don't like to be rude to people. So, I usually start from the idea that most people are probably also like that they don't necessarily want to be rude or annoy you. If it's something that a quark somebody has sometimes you just have to Tell them honestly about something that they do that may annoy you and have to understand that they may not like what they hear. And they may not like you afterwards but you need to come from a position of friendliness."

So I would say that this has happened in the past as a lab manager for a physics teaching lab, you are in charge of a lot of stuff, right? I came into the position without anything, really being organized. I really had to reorganize everything. And then in this position as well, we also do a lot of renovation. So there's a lot of moving around the things and then reorganizing again, and again, and it was okay. I actually quite enjoyed that reorganization process. Making sure things were not only in their place, but in the place that they were easy to get to that made sense, right? So I think, typically, I'm not really a disorganized person, especially in my workplace, but when there's change happening, things tend to get disorganized, even just objects and you just have to go with the flow, think about how you could best use this opportunity to make something better."

Among my greatest strengths are a spirit of collaboration and enthusiasm for the projects that I get involved in. I am good at including people in the process and encouraging them along the way. Due to a lot of the environments that I've been in, through the years that have involved larger teams, I've risen to the top of those sort of situations, being able to work well together with other people. Again, as I said and encouraging and facilitating communication. An area where I would say that I'm a little weak would be the desire to take the project myself. However and and not collaborate, which sounds like a bit of an oxymoron but I like to I've I'm learning after all these years to show my work and to do what I do in the middle of everybody and involve other people in the process and learning line of sight. Communication. Whereas my tendency is to take the material or take the my part of the project and work on it. Independently by myself and then bring it back into the group as opposed to working with people visibly. So everybody can see what I'm doing and I can see what everybody else is doing. And that's an area of weakness for me, but it's getting much stronger."

It's not that I have sought to develop. Intentionally so much. That skill is just that. That's the way that I instinctively act, I suppose, I have refined it some over the years, but I think, as I mentioned earlier in the interview, one of my strengths is being able to work together with other people. To build bonds. And to come alongside people to encourage and support them individually and then because of that, Support one-on-one and encouragement one-on-one, it tends to have a building effect on the team so that we work together more as a team and feel better as a team because each person is being acknowledged recognized and and their values being acknowledged."

I've worked in several different job settings where I've been around a multitude of different people and I think that has helped me with my communication skills over the years because I've had experience working with so many different types of people that I know how to adjust what I'm saying and how I'm saying it to go well with the person that I'm speaking to I would say as far as weaknesses I'm not very good at public speaking.

I mean, I am worried about money in the way that obviously money pays the bills but like money doesn't control my life and neither does status So those are two things that I do not let control me at all but when it does come to a professional setting, I tend to think to into things and that's a downfall of mine."

I'm not perfect. And there are times that I do get annoyed, because sometimes my patients does run thin. But for the most part, I try to be really understanding with others, because, I know, Not everybody has the same thought process, not everybody grew up the same. Not everyone has the same like situations in life and that can really change people's personality and who they are. So when I talk to other people, like in their mind, what they're doing, could be normal, but it could be annoying me. So I try to be patient and understanding with everyone because that's just who I am. Because I know everybody's different. Everybody goes about things differently. And that's okay.

Like I have to have everything organized or else. I will not be able to focus on my work so it's definitely not typical of me, but there are times when I do get caught up in work and my office. I get a little messy or things may get out of place, so I try and make time.

I don't have to shuffle around yours, trying to find stuff. I feel like that just kind of puts a damper on your day and it kind of brings you down.

I have worked a lot of different jobs in my 45 years of living, I started working at 17 when I joined the military 23 years in total in the military. So I got some mixture of professional. And government service, but in a professional environment I was amongst loan officer, I guess that would best suit the situation of this particular question. Okay? How did I add behave in such situations? I made sure that I was grounded, I was still myself, regardless of, if I was dealing with commercial loans that were to the tentative about three and a half million dollars. With building facilities the churches and private schools and so on and so forth. Is what I did loans for, what I did notice and I did understand, you understand that, at the end of the day, I had to steal be myself. I was selling the product of money of the Avenue of borrowing for certain organizations, so, I think that what I had to do in those situations was still be myself professionally.

To a squad leader to leader, Mattoon Surah verse, our operations are done on all of those little levels program. Eating one soldier, all the way up to lead about 150. So, each one of those changes in leadership level as a leader. And even as an individual, I did more observing. When I first arrived in speaking, I wanted to see how the team jail together, where our strong points were where our weak points were, what were some areas that my experience and information that I had to bring to the table to fit into the team, to help build it to be the best version of whatever. That team was insisting upon the members that we had, because each, like I said, each one of those teams in each one of those levels, it was a little different, but just more information.

His name was can't say this guy. We were overseas in Afghanistan during combat done quite a few things left and right. That just annoyed the crap out of me and what he would do. Literally almost the opposite of what I was instructing them to do. Or we told to Do they came time to act out? He would do his own thing and it was just like working with somebody who was Wanted to be consistently retarded for no reason. I hate to use that word. Well, what it caused me to do is to learn to be more patient with him a little bit more time when I gave them instruction. And sometimes I had to break things down to him to make sure that he got all of the information that was needed. This one particular situation that with him. It pops in my mind is there was a particular kind of tested we used, which was a color-coded tit in what I trained him and all the other soldiers on it, he did not share with me that he was colorblind and I found out that it was color blind to the midst of who the actual and having him, as having to use the test to detect for explosives on something.

I guess the only other time that my workspace was never really organized when I was learning how to be organized. And that was very early on in my career. I guess he could take it all the way back to basic training that was within days, that was corrected because there was systems in place to make sure that I or anyone. Would not move forward and not be organized. Doing the particular jobs that I've had to do with in the United States Army over the course of twenty three years.

I started almost four years ago now and it was a completely new team of people for me at a new organization and I was a little bit shy first I kind of like to feel out my co-workers and kind of learn about them before I start sharing a lot about myself but I tend to just work wise jump, right? In. I'm more of a Hands-On learner. And again, I don't hesitate to ask questions, so entering a new team. I like to start as an active participant, get right to work and help others and I think again, it's just in my nature. I like to be right in the thick of things. I don't like to just sit by and let others do the work. So when I enter a new team, I'm definitely an active participant. A little bit quiet at first. But definitely, you know more outgoing as I get to know everybody better."

So if I feel that I am starting to feel annoyed or upset, what kind of step away from the situation and assess, why I'm feeling that way. And what I can do personally to help myself feel Better. Because I recognize that I can't change the behaviors of others. I can just change how I respond to certain situations and I think that has just come recently, honestly, in my role as a parent just learning that, hey, people are going to do what they want to do. And all I can really do in response is decide how I want to behave and how I want to handle a certain situation. But I recognized myself that sometimes Ames. I need to take a step back and really give myself some space and some time to really think through the best course of action."

I work in the medical field where I find myself always working from a like, communal nursing station. So I don't have my own dedicated desk area. So by Nature, I have to be organized because I don't like creating mess for other people to be in. And I again, I think just because of the nature of the work that I Have done. So it's not not typical of me to be disorganized. I feel that I become a little bit anxious to if things are really disorganized. So if there is a community workspace that is really messy, I tend to try to get things in order and organize them because I feel that everything flows better when they're highly."

I always think of the bottom line, what is the end product? Do I need to get so many widgets out? Do? I need to make a profit of a certain amount. Do I need to train employees so that they know how to do what they need to do. So these are the things that that I do to affect my status in an organization."

Be very professional treat everybody with respect. I have just why do I do that? I think that war can get accomplished when everyone is treated with respect and everyone feels that they're on equal footing and everyone can contribute to the situation. So that is the first thing I do is to establish a rapport with with the entire team.

And kept them aside and then after the that school year, I assess whether or not I needed them and that's how I dealt with that situation."

I worked at a pet store as a sales associate and there is a we were incredibly understaffed and my manager was trying to persuade me to take on a manager. Managerial job. I was very hesitant because I have never been in that position. I do. Don't feel comfortable telling people what to do. But you know, I decided It's probably about time, I have experience in that sense. given the amount of jobs I have in my age so I accepted and I enjoyed it. I really liked the as a manager. There's a lot of things that are more accessible. I can get into the cash. Register. If there's an error with change or anything, I can close and lock the store set the alarm stuff like that. Like a lot more ease of access."

And if I see something that could be organized better, I'll just take that on and start organizing. It or trying to make it just easier to work with for everyone and usually, people appreciate that.

So one of my greatest strengths as a candidate as an employee is the fact that when I get really passionate about something I become really driven and I work really hard to make sure that if there's something I need to learn that, I learn it and that I get the right resources. If it's something that I need help with, but generally, I'm a self-starter. I'm somebody who is definitely able to work autonomously, and I really thrive in quiet environment. Ants but yet at the same time, I can work with other people. I would say that one of my weaknesses is that sometimes I definitely mentally take my work home with me. I will get fixated on something like a problem that I'm trying to solve in terms of a work situation and I will think about it to death and sometimes this is you know it's one of those things that I just need to learn better. How to let something go. Oh, and then, you know, be fresh when I am back at work again, because if I get too fixated on something, it affects my ability to sleep. Well, and of course, when you don't sleep well for a certain amount of days, then you really start to feel it, you know, in terms of your ability to do just about anything. So I would say that it's, it's like, my greatest strength is also a weakness. So I definitely have things like that to work on."
6157d22b9998f96a77f41567_q2_c1_1671654811_def862fe-1afa-429a-8e65-1653466b45b3,"So I'm going to go a little tiny bit off this topic, if that's okay, because my first thought when I read the question, how would your best friend describe you is? But I don't really think I have a best friend. I have a lot of friends, but I wouldn't say that. Any one of them is a best friend that I do a lot of things with or that I'm in contact with on a daily or even several times a week basis. I am a really independent Inand. I'm friends with a lot of very independent people and so, in terms of how these people would describe me, I'll think of them as an aggregate, okay? In terms of how they would describe me, I would say that they would describe me as ambitious and driven meticulous. Conscientious, they would probably say that sometimes I can get a little bit too wrapped up in a particular task that I'm working on. I can get a little bit. You know, to perfectionistic about it and then I need to cut myself a break. In fact, that's often what I hear from friends is, you don't see yourself in the way that other people see you. I'm really good at seeing good in other people, but for myself, I'm pretty perfectionistic. And sometimes to a fault and you know, I'll raise my own bar higher higher, higher, and that's not necessarily good. And so I think that other people would describe me Basically, in that way is that I need to cut myself a break and just kind of chill out a little bit and not be so hard on myself."
6157d22b9998f96a77f41567_q3_c1_1671654950_def862fe-1afa-429a-8e65-1653466b45b3,"So, I've actually just done this, the idea of making a professional decision, that affected my status, and how much money I made not in recent history, but all coming up on two years ago, my college, shut down for a variety of reasons. And most of the faculty were not given any kind of severance. We were not brought over to the school that our buildings were sold to in the area and And I'm in an area where really, there are no options for me, getting back into higher education. So, you know, I do have faculty friends, who decided that being a professor, was something that was, you know, they were younger than me and a lot of cases and they just, you know, they were only coming up on mid-career and I'm like, late mid-career and they were willing to just move anywhere in the United States to get a job. I was not, I have a home here. I have roots. Ear. And I'm also not that far from family. So the fact of the matter is that the decision I made to not go back into higher education when it was taken out of my hands. When that job was taken from me that absolutely affected my status. All you have to do is say that you're a tenured professor and people just treat you differently. And it absolutely 100% affected how much money I make. Because I'm Working for prolific, I am doing a gig work and I'm in a difficult place. So, the fact is that there's a point to all of it. There's learning experiences going on. And the fact is that I'm also kind of refining, the kind of work that I want to do and definitely looking for a career change."
6157d22b9998f96a77f41567_q4_c1_1671655072_def862fe-1afa-429a-8e65-1653466b45b3,"Okay, so when I join a new team of people, admittedly, I am the kind of person who is probably pretty quiet in situations like that. I am an introvert, but I'm an introvert, who can do extrovert type things case in point. I was a college professor for almost 30 years, which requires you to be very extrovert in your work Work World. So, I'm typically somebody who kind of hangs back a bit and I get to know people. I of people a lot. I get to know people, very, very slowly, but then I'm one of those people that once I do get to know somebody and trust them, especially on a team, I am I open up. So it's one of those situations where I've tried to be the opposite. I've tried to just run into a team and be the extrovert and it just feels very false to me. And I don't think that that's something that one should apologize for is the idea of Being pretty introverted because it means that I'm a good Observer and it means that I'm a good listener and a good Problem, Solver. And so essentially, when I meet a new team of people, that is how I behave. It's, I'm pretty quiet. It's just the same way that I am in regular life. I mean, I don't try to be somebody. I'm not in a work situation. I'm genuine as can be and so that's really why it is because if I were to meet a group of people Well, socially that I didn't know ahead of time, I would do the same thing. I would sort of be the quiet one or one of however, many quiet people in the group until I got to know people and started to form a bond with them."

I think a situation in the workplace specifically where someone annoyed me having been a former Professor. I think that we almost automatically assume. Oh, it's a student who annoyed you. And sure, there are examples of that. But I think one of the most challenging situations that I ever faced was when a colleague annoyed me and this colleague was known for annoying everyone. I had my office changed and And when I moved to a different part of campus in the library, for my new office, I was two doors away from this other faculty member, who was not in my department, by the way. But was a Humanities faculty member. This was a person who had long-term been involved with the college and multiple people had requested to have their offices moved away from her and she could be very, very nice. It wasn't that, it's that she would not let you get work done and That between that and some really, really radical political views that were completely opposite. Mine, it was a real challenge to be able to be there because I didn't want to move my office. And, you know, so what I did is, I really tried to get to know her or deflect her discussion to topics on which we had common ground, both animal rescuers. And so, we would talk a lot about that and if she would come in my office, I'll fiery over something political. I would just kind of say, you know, we don't agree on that stuff, let's just not even Even talked about it, like how's your cats doing? And I would try to just get her into a different space because I definitely did want to get along with her and she was honestly like, like people kept saying to me, they couldn't believe that I was getting along with her, but I'm pretty good at being able to get along with a lot of people."
6157d22b9998f96a77f41567_q6_c1_1671655301_def862fe-1afa-429a-8e65-1653466b45b3,"I think that when I work on site, I do have a very organized workspace. I would say that. Every time I would leave for the day, I would make a point to tidy up my desk. I am one of those people who really likes to have my email list down to very few people that I need to respond to and I'm really good at responding to people quickly as long as the as of people don't get out of hand. Now, what I have found is that in switching to remote working. I definitely have some difficulties and challenges keeping my workspace, organized and I think it's just because I tend to work in one part of my house, and then at some point, I'm kind of thinking, well, let's just go work in another room and I shift everything to that room, but I don't completely break down the office space in the First place and I just kind of, you know, time of year. I might want to sit out on my porch to work. So I know that as a challenge that I face and when things get a little bit out of hand, I just start making lists and checking things off list."

So I will do my best and focus all my efforts into trying to complete the job or task as delivered. I generally work very well with other people. I'm very cooperative and opening open to listening to everybody's ideas before making any definite, Conclusions, even if I disagree, I'm still happy to listen to other people's opinions and see if they can sway. My opinion in case they have a better idea and I generally like working with people, I feel that I function well in a team, I can function well as either a manager or as an employee who responds to other people's requests and I'm very good with time. Timelines and generally, I believe that. I'm able to complete the job in the specified period of time. And so, this is not, you know, not a difficult thing. For me, I love being part of a team. I like, I'd be I like being a team player. I like promoting the morale of the team and doing activities that will help everybody work together and feel very comfortable. In addition to doing extracurricular activities outside of work. So some of my weaknesses though would be. Sometimes, it's, I have a little bit of a hard time saying, no, or I'm a little bit too eager to please his, sometimes I'm a little bit shy and speaking out, if I feel that I disagree with people, and that they would not you my opinions as being Worthy."
615880a66bc32302998866d9_q2_c1_1672161915_ee598c9c-df13-412e-af80-7591da22783a,"I think my best friend would say that. I'm a very dependable person and somewhat obsessive-compulsive when it comes to planning. We have taken many, many trips together with their families. And I guess I would say that I do like to have everything planned. I mean, I just feel that You know that? I just don't like to leave too many things to chance. I mean, of course, sometimes it's fun to be spontaneous, but I look for instance, I like to have dinner reservations for every single night just in case. So that, you know, we don't have to struggle to find a place to eat. I would also say that, you know, once I, once I start an idea, I really want to finish it. You know, I will work tirelessly to try to finish being. So, in that way, I'm also a little obsessive compulsive, but then again, again I'm always willing to go the extra mile to do things for my friends and you know, I will make time for them and I will always make time to see them if I'm in town, even if they're out of town because my best friends are actually out of town, we don't live in the same city, although we've known each other for many, many, many years,"

For instance, I decided and one point to work part-time when my when my child was very young and you know, maybe that affected my status in that, I was making less money. But then again, I could spend more time at home. Home and doing things and being there for certain situations. And so I just feel that family really means a lot to me and I feel that I just want to be there in those situations because some of those moments will never come again in your child's life. And so I feel that that's a little bit more important to me than my status as a professional. The other thing is also that Chose to work for a larger group so that they could help manage our finances. Help manage, I guess our partnership. So my partner and I decided to join a larger groups hoping that they would do more of the administrative things. And so I guess, you know, in that instance, you know, we were making most money because we had to pay more overhead and I just believe that no just comes down to what you think is most important. Whether it's really it's more about making money or your social status, you know, in the group or whether it's more about your family."

And I don't want to, you know, judge people too harshly or anything like that. So, maybe I'm a little bit more cautious, typically, a cautious person. I don't really take a lot of risks. They are willing to take some minimal risks, but I don't do, Do anything that's terribly risky because I feel that that really you know, that's just not my personality or that really worries me and I just like to make sure that things are secure. So I would say that that's how I would typically behave until I get to know them a little bit better than. I probably certainly don't talk about certain things such as politics or, you know, anything that might raise any eyebrows or make them think that You know, if I'm not really sure what they think about my viewpoints. So I would say that I'm pretty, I'm a fairly cautious person and that I just kind of go with the flow, and I don't do a lot to try to rock the boat. I just try to fit in with the new team."

You know, they can't make a decision and, you know, I'm not talking about major decisions where people have the right to ponder things. But I guess when you know, people can't commit to something, that's a symbols, let's say a social situation and you know, you asked him whether you know, this is something that they want to do. And they'll just say I don't really know or they don't really answer you. I think that's very annoying. I think it's somewhat inconsiderate and And how would I usually react? I guess I would say that I am annoyed but it depends on how well, I know the person, if I know them very well, then I will probably ask them again and ask them to reiterate. You know, what is bothering them or you know, how we could make it better now if it's something somebody that I don't know too? Well then I probably would just ignore it, although I'll be annoyed, but I won't necessarily say anything to them. If it's a situation of family then yeah. Certainly confront them, I guess, at some point, if it's something that's happened more than once and I will just you know just flat out ask them because I like to be honest and forthright"

I mean, I think, I mean, there's a little bit of an organization that sometimes I'll have piles of papers on my desk and stuff like that, but I generally know where everything is. It's not that I have large piles on the floor or you know, things that are overflowing on the desk that I don't keep track of because in general, I think I'm a fairly organized person. I like to be neat in a lot of situations, but particularly, I just like to know where everything is. And so, you know, typically I would say that I'm a fairly organized person. I like to know where the things are, that are more urgent that need to be taken care of horses and things that can be put on the back burner a little bit. And so I kind of have my workspace. On eyes did in such a fashion where I know, where the more urgent things are, where the less urgent things are and so it's not typically a problem for me.

I used to work at a electrical Apprentice for the IBEW and whenever I felt like I was ready for a pay raise, I would call the office and be like I did this much hours and I didn't do this much work, I feel like I should get a pay bump and they would review it and we would end the phone call and then a couple of days Days after that. I'd be like, okay, here's a pay. Raise enjoy it. And I'll be like, okay, thank you and I'm not trying to push it any further and just end the phone call,"

I I did not speak to anybody unless I was spoken to and I think it's because I want to be seen as respectful and I want to be seen as somebody that doesn't step on their toes and I want to be given respect as I give them Respect by being quiet and only being spoken to when they speak."
616604bed27acb2f4e2841a9_q5_c1_1673542854_5ae224fd-c0e5-4414-8a15-75d68666b253,"There was one time in that job I had. I had enough of somebody trying to Power Trip me being like, go get this, go get that. And while I am an apprentice and the journeyman is telling me to get this stuff, you could add, you know, nicer vocabulary to his askings. Like, can you go get this? Please not barking orders at me like a dog and I usually am okay with it until I start bottling it up, bottling it up and It gets to be too much and I think it's because of what I said before with given respect and not getting respect. So I was not getting respect from that particular. Journeyman and I would not going to give him that same respect. And one time I had just enough and you told me to get the one thing and I said, I can't remember. When I said, I know, I walked away and I said something to my under my breath. And he came into his truck, and we will go over to me. Hold on a second."

I'm usually a very clean person because of the lightweight I love and my parents always taught me to clean up after myself and It made me feel a little gross because people around me with just like eating their granola bars and just throwing it beside the trash can but not in trash can and it just really annoying me."

I've shown a lot of determination in previous projects and previous work. So I think that sets me apart from a lot of my peers as far as greatest weakness is probably I like to really rush into a project little bit too much. So a lot of times I won't always stop to think about the problem. I'll just go right into it because like, oh, here's first solution, it works cool, let's just run with it and I notice I have to take it back."

I mean, I'm always there for their behind their back, like, always ready to help them forward and always there if they ever need somebody. So I think that would be the best thing that would describe me. I also think just creative guy because I like to create a new ideas of things. I can do and I think that's a big part of who we are as a friend group, I think that's how it was my best friend would describe me us. I think that my friend would be very fun and I think you would describe me as somebody that's very caring and somebody that's very loyal. Most of all, mostly because I've been with him for"

At least I tried to behave as professional as possible in these types of situations. I think, if you can show us respect and pretty logical level-headed professionalism. I think that can really set you apart you and if the results aren't exactly in you, your favor, I like to try and be pretty level-headed overall just to give them the sense that I am straight and narrow and dependable person. So I behave in these situations because I think I calm myself down overall, I'm life and I know when to be worried and whatnot to and 99% of cases, I don't need to worry."

Everybody try and break the ice because it can be a little bit tense situation but I also want to make sure that I and presenting myself that would be somebody that I would respect. So I usually try and be very logical and fun but also kind of commanding presence as best as I can. I do this because I want to have that commanding presence as the sort of atmosphere that I've developed over time and something that I've developed, all my life really to try and be able to get those types of leadership positions."

I'll get very serious, and I'll just take them to the side usually, and I will express my annoyance of them very Stern way. Way but somewhat calm. So they know I'm in full control of the situation but that they shouldn't do anything further and I think that's that's response because then they know who they're dealing with and it's a form of system respect behind it. And I think it usually has pretty good effects."

I know where everything is, but overall, I think everything's got decent organization to it. I like to have a lot of stuff in front of me, so I can be like, okay, what's that? What's that go from thing to thing. So, that's a little bit more. My typical or space that I think it gets the creative juices, Is Flowing more than other things and that's how I like to operate at most times. So that's just the work environment. I like,"

Do my task task on time. I'm not late. I don't like confrontation, so I won't argue with people and but that also can be my weakness because I tend to let people run over me. But yeah, I would have to say that is my greatest strength getting along with people and getting stuff done on time. I love to help people out if I finish my work and I see that they need. Help finishing. There's I don't mind helping."
61bb392e40db417c1a138dcb_q2_c1_1671743010_ad0e5115-32ed-4201-836d-7aeb1949b270,"I think my best friend would describe me as a hardworking person. I'm very family-oriented. Silly. I love to make people. Laugh of. I love to laugh myself. I just like to be a good influence on people. They would say that I like to help people out, actually sacrifice. A lot to help people out. So I guess that's mainly how they would describe me would be, I'm a generous person caring. I have sympathy for people less fortunate than myself. They would probably say that I don't go out much. I'm a homebody unless I am working, but once I start a task or job work and work and work until I get it done, so I think that's how they would describe me."

I like to do a good job so I don't like to be rushed on stuff. I like to be very thorough so I guess I have turned jobs down before, because I didn't think I could get it done in the length of time they wanted and have it be you? No, great quality. And it did affect my money but I don't want my name on anything, that's not good. So I wouldn't do a poor job just to make money. I would I put my all into it. 100%. Every time."

So it takes me a little while to get to know the people I'm working with, but it takes me a while to trust them also. So I'm not one of those people that just automatically trust somebody just because this person over here says you can trust them. But, um, Yeah, I would get to know everybody and get to know their strengths and maybe I could help them with their weaknesses and maybe they could do the same for me. Help me out when I need it. Maybe I'm not good at something. Maybe they could show me how to get better at it and I could offer the same. I do like to help people, I would help them. I would pick up where they are falling behind. And I would hope they would do the same for me someday if I needed it. So, yeah, that's That's what I would do when joining a new team of people just get to know them. Find out all about them, hopefully, they'll be friendly and will let me in so,"

I'll try to talk to the person and, and well, I really don't bring it up until it gets to be a problem. So if somebody had me, I guess I would just, you know, tell them what they're doing and ask them maybe. If they could stop what they're doing or maybe we could come to a compromise of you know, what they are doing and why it's bothering me and maybe a something I need to work on myself and it's not necessarily that person all that person. But yeah I guess communication is the number one. Factor. when working with other people, your you have to be willing to compromise and you have to be willing to sit down and have a talk with them and just put it all out on the table and see what they think about it."

I like to have everything in its place. So when I'm ready to use it, I know exactly where to find it. I don't want to have to take more time, just to go find something. But I think that everybody should try to be organized. It's just a good way to go about work. Yeah, I just wouldn't want to get up during something very important and have to go find a stapler or paper clips or a report I did or something. You know, that needs to be turned in for a client or something like that. I think that's it's it's not a good look for the clients. If they were to see that, you know, if they were to call you and be like, was the numbers on that report looking like today, and I wouldn't want to be like, well, I'm going to have to call you back because I have to go find it. I'm not sure where I put it but yeah, I think a good organized. Workplace is the best. I think everybody should strive for that."

Typically I use more than one platform to monitor my time arrange, my schedule and keep me on track, such as timers on my phone calendars and other such devices. Additionally, I would say a great strength of mind and flexibility as I'm willing to change my Approach as I grow and learn or as I receive feedback. I was a relative weakness of mine would be work life. Balance, I'm not very good at that and I typically tend to focus more on work, which is something I'm hoping to learn to be better at during this traineeship. Additionally, I believe that I could benefit from increasing my communication or effective communication skills when discussing with others, especially those who I'm working with, as a supervisor and or as a mentor, I believe that this is an area of weakness as sometimes. My thoughts do not come across and correct manner or aren't as helpful. Or as constructive as I would like them to be and therefore I think you or traineeship are you mentorship training, should program would be a great and valuable asset to my future development."

If you my best friend is always kind of shocked at the different things. I am learning to do or the different Hobbies I'm being involved in or trying out or interested in or just that I really do. Enjoy learning and coming to understand. Being of the World Around Me gaining all the experiences. I can really try to just develop and live a full life.

I usually try to take it or, you know, from an analytical approach. So I will try my best to calm myself down, consider the pros and cons of the situation. And we're going to be in line with my aspirational goals at work and also my values as a person because I don't really want to perform any actions that go against my values. Additionally, I might consult with those I trust or who have met had to make a similar decision or I've had just might just be valuable to talk to or just get a different idea or Insight on And I typically think I like to do this because oftentimes making a decision, it can have multiple parcel aspects, many different outcomes, especially if it's, you know, for my future and so on, make sure I'm doing what's right by me and you know, necessarily with, right by me, not might not be right for a company.

You know there are some times where it's been awkward, you know the new person there's really a sense of cohesiveness and team unity. And what I do is I just act like myself. I will talk to them, I will ask questions that, you know, I'm generally interested in them as people ask for assistance, I'll acknowledge my faults, I will try to grow and develop and you know, fit within the team and Best, as I can, while still being my true and authentic self, you know, to me, that means, once again, you're asking questions, making jokes, sometimes I might bring in baked goods as I enjoy baking. And I really think that's just the best approach because being authentic being myself is best way to integrate within a team for them to learn your work ethic your skills, your abilities to get them, get for them to get to know you as a person and for them to understand you know how You work with them and you know, so there's no surprises in hectic, situations or tense moments and I really think just front.

And I think, you know, all the reason I think like this is because it's important to, you know, understand yourself before you can kind of influence change or affect change. Because if you're doing things just because they annoy you, then, you know, you're not really considering if you have areas of growth or you know, what's going on in your life or, you know, maybe it's a sign that you're more stressed than usual and I think it's, you know, it could be a good indicator as as to maybe more about you and more about the situation as well."

And I, but I do things that I am open to learning from other people. And so, I have like, when I've come into the past, in the past, when I was coming to a problem where I think I'm just like we overloaded, I've been able to talk to superiors who had been working in my organization longer and ask for advice on time management on things that seemed feasible what things I should draw breath. rather than keep keeping my plate and not do fully or succeed in"

Those are important considerations, but for the most part I work for experience and I've taken some less-than-ideal positions or projects on just because I knew that it would be good for me in the end.

I do think that I try extra hard to be a little bit more outgoing and to ask questions about other people. Because I do think people like to be asked questions about themselves like not too impersonal and not too mundane, like what's your favorite color? But I do think people respect and appreciate when you show an interest in them personally. So I always try to get to know the person through being an interesting question. Questions. Like, you know I asked about favorite restaurants but you know within a certain Cuisine maybe just that you can dive a little bit deeper into who they are.

I don't typically I don't typically confront people when I've been annoyed by something especially if it's something that I find myself doing but I do kind of internalized it reflect on it and you know Cy what exactly about the behavior about this person is annoying me and like looking inward to see what I may need to work on just because everyone is a work in progress and everyone deserves graced and gentleness and of course if There are serious issues that need to be spoken about, you should have a conversation but for the most part I think our annoyances especially the smaller ones kind of Point wherein work.

My mentor, didn't take very many notes either, so I didn't get a lot of feedback early on, but there's a point where my Pi kind of spoke to the whole Lab because It seems like it was a love boy problem, that, you know, maybe we should be a little bit more strict and how we're doing are no exams. And the information that we are including just because it's helpful for ourselves and for people who come after us we made Peter experiments. I feel like it can be somewhat typical of me when I don't get when I don't want, I'm not presented with good examples of how to keep notes because the note taking is important in different ways in the things like teaching.

The my company. It was a Six Sigma program and I had a chance to train in Six Sigma in which I was be required to go through the training, go through a project and Essentially take a test and be great about for my project. And also the skills that I've learned. So there was an opportunity for potential failure, but at the same time, a real opportunity to grain, gain some really good skills that I could use going forward. And I decided that best was definitely worth it. It was a great opportunity for development. It was something new in the company, so you weren't sure exactly how well, it was going to be received in the end. But I thought it was well worth the work and effort put into it and I did it. I ended up being top of my class and I subsequently became a black belt in Six Sigma Sigma and it's something that has done me well throughout my career."

You know what they're really they're their concerns are really get their thoughts and ask questions. I don't like to go in and just simply make quick Patient's and statements, I write the first, I'd like to take a step back, get the lay of the land from the group make sure they understand that. I know I'm, I am there at verse to learn. I'm their opinions or really valued and as I hear things I will then make some comments. Let them know what my thoughts are, what my experiences and how relevant they are to what they're doing to really try to create that bond, that is needed. Added in a team and make time, just make sure that they can understand that I'm someone they can trust and make sure that our relationship is strong going forward."

And I try to do is to take a step back and kind of try to understand what is triggering my annoyance. You know, is it, is it environmental? Is it? What's going on around me at the time? Is it really specifically something about this person? Am I bringing something to the table? As it reminding me of something. Is it the events that happened during the day to really understand what's going on? And at that point in time, you know, I can take the next steps. If it really is the individual themselves, that is that something that they're doing or saying that I just disagree with, or I'm not happy with, you know, they're depending on the specifics of the situation. One is you can simply, you know, politely remove yourself from that. Situation or to start to ask them questions. I find that as a very effective technique, sometimes ask them questions even really are in knowing you because of what they're saying, ask them questions about it you know make them see that. Maybe what they're saying, isn't that accurate or Etc. But overall, I mean, people are going to annoy you and that's going to happen. It's part of human. Human being a human. And I think the first thing to do is to understand again where it's coming from from that, then you can take action."

I'm fairly and I think I said before in a previous question fairly disciplined person, I'd like things in their place in, you know to move forward. I find it a lot easier. I think having a well-organized workspace is takes away some of the stress and just makes for a better work environment. I mean, in situations, where that was The case for whatever the reason I mean occasionally it does happen to everyone no matter how well organized you are. I usually make sure that I take the time to get it organized. It's worth taking a few minutes to put things in order. I mean, sometimes in a day, things can build up and that can happen. But I taking that time and not letting it continue to build like over over night except ra and then you start off next day with more disorganization. So I like to take care of it immediately."

If we make a pitch, I can tell by their body language if I need to Pivot, the, the pitch to something that would pertain personally to them or if they're really interested, I can tell and then I'll keep going with the pitch. So I really value being able to read other people even my other employees, my co-workers to see if I am on the right track or the wrong track. Especially if they're not verbally telling me and weakness can be that I get bogged down in details of things when it's really just an overall picture. If I'm pitching something to my supervisor and I will go into miniscule details when he just wants a really good overview. View of what the project is, and what I'm thinking about and how thinking about the sales pitch. And instead I'll go into too many details that he doesn't have time to listen to and he doesn't care. As long as I get the sales pitch done and I can pitch it to the client."

I'm highly responsible, highly organized our follow up and a follow through. If I say I'm gonna be somewhere next week, Friday at 2:00, nobody has to call me or Check with me, they know on Friday at 2, I'm going to be where I said it was going to be which I guess is also reliable as well. So that's definitely how I would be described responsible, highly organized, taking charge and reliable."
6234790e93ccbf5fc88ad4fe_q3_c1_1672095722_883f601d-674f-48b1-895b-e50d41702ed2,"So I started my professional career in one industry and I felt like I was selling my soul. I had to hide information or I have to deny things rumors that were heard and kind of give up my moral compass to be a liar of a mission and I didn't appreciate that. And even though the paycheck was good, the industry I was in wasn't so I kept my skills, my education things I've learned on the job and I used it in another industry because those skills translate it over to another industry where I didn't have to give up my moral compass. So I took a pay cut in that instance because there was no bonus that I was able to feel better about myself in the long run and enjoy my job more and I got promoted quicker than if I sit at the other. Our firm. So in the long run, it was good for me. It was good for my mental health, and eventually became better for my wallet. But I did take a pay cut. When I did leave industry for the same job in a different industry."

I'm used to taking charge and kind of being in that leadership position even in a team of my equals. However, since I was a new employee and people don't really know me and I was trying to get a feel for the team and who kind of the alphas were. And, and the followers were, I kind of kept my opinions to myself and I just Listened and observed staying who had more of a creative brain, and who took the lead, and who was more the organizer. So, that's kind of rare for me to not be involved and give my opinion even if it's not a popular opinion with the team. So it took me maybe a couple of weeks to kind of sit back and observe before I was able to behave in the way that I behave. Now, what? Is organizing kind of becoming the team lead. I do that out of respect, especially since I'm the new person, the low person on the totem pole, I don't want to step on toes and I also want to have that time to really get to know who my coworkers are their personalities. I don't want to make a bad impression right away. And I want to make sure that I am respectful of the organization of the seniority. And then Through my work and how I take on other people's work or help them? It kind of gets to the point where people realize that I'm more of a leader position and I do like to Give opinions but not at first."

I really try to keep my work and personal lives separate. Except, obviously, if there's work functions, and I'll go with the team and the group and the department, but basically, when I get to work on their to work, I want to get my work done and I've had employees or coworkers that come in every Monday with some My other story about the weekend and what happened and some other drama and kind of, I guess venting sometimes they want advice, sometimes they don't it's mostly about them venting and feeling out if they did the right thing or the wrong thing, but it was every single week, every single Monday, and it got me behind in my work because I make a list of what I need to get done before I leave for the day and then start a list for the next day. So it became a Distraction. So I ended up having to talk to them about asking them about kind of their home life and their friends and kind of get a feel for who was around them and their social life. So they wouldn't have to rely on me as well as often. So I would say something like, what is, you know, your roommate think about that. Did your mom have an opinion and then it kind of got to where they felt more comfortable asking for advice from the social people in their lives and kind of backed off on top. Talking to me."
6234790e93ccbf5fc88ad4fe_q6_c1_1672096038_883f601d-674f-48b1-895b-e50d41702ed2,"The only time I can really think about my workspace, not being organized is when I first get there and I take somebody's desk over or their office over. It's very distracting for me. The first thing that I typically do if I'm in a new office or cubicle or workspace, is I organize it to where my brain works. It might not be an objective type of organization, but for me, It's where everything needs to be for my brain to kind of focus on my work and not be distracted about the stapler being in the wrong spot or the pens there's no pens around. So it's very not typical of me to have a disorganized workspace. So what I typically do is I'll take that first day and maybe even stay after, because the first day or the first week, it's kind of training. I'll come in earlier, I'll go in late and I'll organize My workspace, I'll make sure that there's paper and writing utensils and the computer is set up how I want it. I'm left-handed, so I have the mouse on my left and the pens within left arm reach. So I'll set everything up my chair to make myself comfortable and have it all organized. So when I need something, I need to staple something, I know where the staplers, and I don't waste time that way. So it's very atypical of me to have a disorganized book space."

And when I get a job started, I'm very thorough and very detail-oriented. And I make sure that every little piece of it gets a John, but in a way that can kind of bleed into one of my weaknesses with kind of overthinking and I can tend to to overthink the heck out of something or kind of feel obligated to do a little bit more than what is required of my job, which I don't necessarily think is a weakness, but I can get held up sometimes on not necessarily making decisions but trying to decide What is what is right and what is too far? And I guess kind of setting boundaries type of thing. But other than that, I think definitely one of my biggest things is being able to focus on the smaller things rather than the bigger picture. I mean, I know the bigger picture is important, but the details are what help you get to the bigger picture. And that's something that I'm really good with."

I kind of don't really go with what's mainstream some of the things that I can say can be a little off the wall. I tend to be, I guess, the little introverted but at the same time I can share a little bit too much. I guess I don't really have a filter, I kind of just say what I'm thinking and don't really understand the The, why anybody wouldn't? I'm actually on the Spectrum, so it's like one of those things where there's all these social Nuances that you're just kind of supposed to know and I don't really know them so I can come off pretty quirky. And and strange to people that don't know me very well or I seen really shy but my best friend would definitely know that. I'm funny. I like to make people laugh. I really like, you know, playing with play on words type of stuff just generally like to make people happy."

Anybody that called me, I felt the need to get them in my schedule and completely fill my books up. And, as time went on, I started realizing that I have to factor in distance and I have to factor in. You know what area of town? Town that I'm in and all of these things can can affect my income, you know, if I have my schedule full with all these people but I'm driving for two hours a day as opposed to only driving 10 minutes a day because all of my clients are in a in the same area. If I map that out better and I have a have to have the ability to say, no. Sometimes when I do have a client come in, That just doesn't really fit into the rest of the schedule. That's where it really can affect how much money I'm making. I mean, I can have all these hours and all of these clients and still have my income not change just because it's not mapped out or scheduled properly, so that's really important."

I worked at an intake office and I guess what, I enter a new team. I can kind of be reserved and standoffish. I usually don't really say much. I kind of just sit and listen and watch what everyone else is doing that way. I can kind of learn, you know, how I'm supposed to do the Job. And what's kind of expected of me socially and I made like crack a joke here and there type of thing but I'm usually kind of standoffish and just more of the observing type. I'm the type to kind of go up to management and ask questions later instead of in front of people, I don't know if that's due to my being on the Spectrum or if it's just how my personality is. But I take in information a lot better if it's like a one-on-one. Type of thing, as opposed to a whole team of people I can get pretty overwhelmed pretty quickly. So, I've kind of learned how to combat that myself and just kind of sit and observe and wait until I feel a little bit more comfortable. Usually, when people start kind of approaching me, I open up a little bit more but it's really hard for me to be the first one."

So if there are a lot of like loud noises or just a lot of noises in general happening, I can get extremely annoyed specifically. If we go to like a restaurant that's also a sports bar and there's music and 17 different TVs in front of you and football playing and people talking and people. All drinking and all of that. Like, I can, I can get extremely annoyed. Usually, I tend to react by either getting really quiet and kind of shutting down and it's pretty physically obvious to people around me but I don't really necessarily say anything. But if I'm at home, I'm pretty open about. You know, just saying stop because I don't know I don't I can only handle so much. It's a Pretty overwhelming to learn. My brain is it is so yeah, I don't know, it's hard to think of just one situation because I get annoyed, pretty much on a daily basis."

Typist, I know where everything is and it's organized to me, but it may look Messier to some other people. I have a habit of leaving things out in sight, because if I don't see it, I'll forget that it's there. And so, a lot of things get left out on surfaces. Just so, I don't forget that they're there or I don't forget to do something, or what have you? I would say this is pretty typical behavior of me. Have always been like this. I'm the type of person where like, you can have a table with 17 different things on it and I can tell you exactly where, pretty much everything on the table is just because I'm a very visual type of person. I don't know. Again, if I had to do to being on the Spectrum or if that's just who I am, but I've always been like that in the funny thing is I'm actually very good at organizing very good at getting organized. Staying organized. I wish was more of my personality, but it's just not."

Once I get started on something, I can't really rest until it's completely done. So I will persist at finishing Whatever task is at hand until I complete it completely, as far as another strength is timeliness. And always on time, always begin things on time to make sure they're done on time as well. My biggest weakness is probably not knowing when to stop, once I begin on something, it's hard for me to let it go. So I will continue going at it and going out and going at it until I actually finish the job, which some people can see as a weakness. Based on not knowing, when to quit."

I tend to be overly helpful sometimes with helping people that I know very, very persistent in helping people out with things that they may not ask for help with even though I realize that they probably do need the help. So I'm very observant and care. Touring when it comes to helping other people do certain things that they may not come out and ask for help for, but I tend to know that they need help with whatever they're doing. I guess due to being. Very aware that tends to show to others how caring I am and how helpful I tend to be, even though sometimes it may be may be overly helpful sometimes."

Depend was deciding on whether or not I wanted to take on a different type of role with more responsibility. Which required more work, more effort and little bit more time during the day to complete all these extra tasks. I primarily took it on because I am interested in being financially, secure being able to retire at a younger age. So I think that Motivated me to be willing to take on a higher stressed position and more responsibilities in order to obtain a higher salary and the ability to hopefully retire at a younger age."

I tend to be more observant, and I tend to listen more just because I want to get an idea of how everybody works together. Their personalities, all they all interact together and ultimately just gauging How everybody works as a group and how I should kind of handle my personality to mesh with there's most efficiently I don't want to be the Oddball out or be too pushy or too quiet. I kind of want to be able to blend in and work. Well with the group that I'm going to be working with on a day-to-day basis.

And I tend to be, I tend to give more subtle hints that. I have a lot of work to do without being without being too harsh. And too angry. I try to just give subtle hints that I not really interested in the conversation and gently let them know that I need, I have other stuff to do and I can't sit there and work with them and speak with them based on what they're trying to talk to me about. Usually it's because I'm not really interested or I have all this stuff that I need to get done. Otherwise I'd probably be more more than willing to sit there and listen. But there's sometimes when I just don't have the time to sit there and listen to day-to-day talk when I have other things that I could possibly be doing."

I don't like clutter, I like being able to know where things are at. I like to have space. I don't like messy areas, it's just my personality. I've always been very organized, very cleanly. I don't like working with things all over the place that I could knock over knock on the floor. I just, I've always been a very clean person.

Being disorganized is Just clutters the mind. we like to see organize things, we like pretty things, I think a lot of times, so I try not to be disorganized I think if as far as a project, like a work project, if Maybe early on when I was doing computer programming. I would tend to be. More disorganized with. I wouldn't take the time to map things out as well and break things down into their parts and organize things as well as I would now, So you add their death. That's definitely encountered that early on because there can be a lot of moving Parts too. You know, programming computer programming. So, if you don't break things down, logically. And organize them then yeah you can. It can really slow, slow you down and confuse you in that kind of a situation, so, I think that's it's not typical of me now. but I think it was more of a learning curve as far as you know, really needing to stop and plan things out."

I'm always looking for problems and trying to come up with solutions to those even if they don't affect me personally, probably my greatest weakness is that I can be a perfectionist and a tend to want others to share those same qualities that I have, and think that having something perfect is also important. And so I can be a little harsh on subordinates because of this,"

I think this is just, you know, once again I'm a perfectionist and those things that irritate me and possibly, you know, it's an attention deficit thing. Thing is, I can't concentrate if things around me are really cluttered and out of place, it just it's important to me. They'll have a clean tidy workspace."

I'll just kind of be a bit more passive and just sort of get A feel for what are some of the Norms like the social norms and what's the hierarchy here? And just really taken, you know, what will be expected of me? And the reason why I do that is because I'm autistic and so it can be hard for me to pick up on those things right away.

So I behave in the sense that I'm always going, really, I'm always working and really take a lot of down time and sometimes I go a little too hard, I think, but I'm successful at what I do and I'm proud of myself.

And I'm very loyal to the ones that I'm friends with and my friends are loyal to me. They've been beside me through good and bad throughout all the years that we've known each other.

Do nearly the business that we normally did for the previous four, four years before that. But I decided to make sure everybody got paid. So I made sure that we did enough business that everybody could get their normal paycheck throughout the year and We stay busy, even though it was remotely, we had a lot of zoom and Google calls and and we did a lot of business over the phone with with private and public customers and that affected the amount of money that we would make.

Two years after covid. I'm still making the same amount of money yearly that I did during the covid year.

I have grown grown child, and a 11 year old son, that lonely lives with me part of the years. So, my income is not, it's not about how much money I make.

When the time is needed to be, if we have a time frame, then I can live with the annoyance if it becomes something that bothers me to the point where we're not getting jobs and stuff done, then I will address the situation and let somebody know what they've done to annoy me. Why in? We need to change it to get the job. When it comes to something outside of work, I'm pretty outgoing and pretty outspoken. So if you annoy me about something, if it bothers me that bad, then I'll tend to I'll let you know. And again, that's my personality and the way I was brought up my father. Very loud outspoken. My mother was very quiet. So I have a little bit of both in there, but if it's outside of work, I tend to let somebody know that they've annoyed me."

I live my entire life. That way my house is the same way. Everything's organized. I try to keep everything in an area where I know where they're at.

The area being organized, and put the way I want it, and I will do that right up until the time I get ready to leave.

I've kept my room as a child organized. I knew where everything was and even down to putting my shoes where they go in my bathroom where my toothbrush go, everything goes back in its place.

And so if other people are not really working, but I can feel that and I will see that. It doesn't seem to be fair to other people who are really are working because other people are goofing off more than what should be done. And of course there's times when that it can be appropriate. But typically, it's something that I don't like to see. In the workplace."

I'm aware of their pain and that type of thing. So I do demonstrate a lot of empathy and relationships and And I would like to demonstrate emotional intelligence, I try to be considerate of other people's feelings and what they're going through and how things affect them, especially once, you know someone, I think that, you know, my best friend will be aware of the fact that I do like to really show up for people as best I can. And in the way that I can given whatever they have, To deal with in life. I will check on someone like especially if someone has died or something like that. They know that I'm known for checking on on them or someone else and making sure that they're, you know, adjusting to the situation. And I try to do what I can to demonstrate my support of people when they're happy. And also when they're sad because I think sometimes some people have a hard time dealing with difficulty and and I'm kind of that person that shows up for someone and I'm known for that along my closer friend, my closest friends, they know that. So my best friend wouldn't know that as well."

And personally I have done things like evaluate the opportunity to see if it was something that fit my personality. Also fit the level of Integrity that I like to demonstrate in life and not just just at work. So I have had the opportunity to take a position that I didn't necessarily feel was the best fit for me or it was actually a university position because it kind of violated some of the ethical choices that I try to demonstrate throughout my life and I felt like it was perhaps too cutting-edge for me and it's not to say that I do. I believe in doing cutting-edge positions to me, I felt that that position kind of was a moral compromise for me, and I do know that there are other solutions that people could use in terms of healthcare to achieve the healthcare goals that they have. So, I did bypass the position that position actually does pay more money than what I have, you know, and burning right now. But I feel like the job that I have is a better fit for me and is more aligned with what I, you know, went to graduate school for and things of that nature or so I feel like that's a better fit for me and allows me to grow in a better way. That's more in line with who I am holistically speaking. So those are the kind of things that I weighed when I am trying to decide whether something fits me or not."

I try to take in how they feel about me as a new member of the team and those things, it kind of changes based on the culture of our organization because I am really Ali big on organizational culture. I mean I'm studying industrial psychology. So that's how big I am on organizational culture and so if I kind of get a feel for an organization and the people that are in those roles and so I've worked in organizations where the staff may have had less education, then some other organizations that have worked in. So, sometimes those people may not necessarily understand the Against of your role when you are doing something that is more aligned with the fact that you do have some training in a field. So you're not necessarily doing, I got like technician type work. So you know, those are the things that I try to do when I'm new is to get a feel for how people perceive things, what my role will be. I try to be friendly because I think that's very important to respect people and whatever their positions Maybe. Be on a team and within an organization and then over the course of time time kind of allows people to see the magnitude of your skills and why, you know, people hire you to do a particular task that they may not have the the ability or the training to do, doesn't mean they can't do it, they just don't necessarily have the training. And so I try to just be as kind as possible, and learn and just let the Time tell, you know, the difference in why I'm there."

So sometimes when I've been annoyed in those type of situations, I have typically you know, just kind of like I mean you kind of make a joke of it but I think the person kind of gets the point that what they said was out of line like I may say something to the effect of well Do you hear what he just said or what are they? What are they talking about? I don't understand why they are. Why are they saying that? You know, because I had that happen, added office function. And the sad thing about it is that this person was not aware that I was already acquainted with the man's girlfriend that he was trying to reference me, you know, being the new employee trying to, you know, start I'm a relationship with and I was like first of all in my head I was thinking this this young man could be my nephew, not my, you know, significant other and who are you to say that? I want a relationship with anyone at work because I don't date at work, but he didn't know this because he just automatically wants to make a joke about hey there's two people who may want to, you know, have a relationship.

So there were instances where our team would have to travel and we would have to kind of put together our workspace from trip to trip. And so, because the workspace wasn't as organized as what I wanted it to be, I had to kind of, you know, organize it in a way that worked for me during each site visit and so that was something that we just typically had to do when we were on the road. But as long as I put everything where I needed it, so that I knew what I was looking at. And why and how it matched the the checklist that I was working with at that particular time since they you know they hire us to do a job and we have to have everything done by a certain time. So this was something that I just typically had to deal with really on 11 site visits a year and so this you just work with it and it works out pretty well."

I'm a natural servant leader and with that sometimes, It's to comes, take it on, you know, much more than is reasonable or the inability to know how to delegate when you delegate. So that is probably one of my greatest weaknesses. You know, looking around the room and it's like, okay, this is not getting down this time getting done. So I do it all.

So, when I reach this point at the decision, being able to pick my career or the money I make or said as my spirit was just calling to kind of walk very authentically. And then the feel that I was in It wasn't a lot of in authenticity. I think the thing was, is that, you know, when we get into racial and gender bias, it was a sense that I needed to be less and so, you know, the criticism became. Will you, you're doing so much or you do so much? So well, you know, and let's slow it down a little bit. So beyond that, though, my spirit more important than that, because it's kind of Earthly my sphere woman, just wanted to serve God. God.

So in every generation there is like a generational shift, you know, because new people are born, that's fine and they grow up and you know, so I come from one era genetics and Being in between Generations. I remember, you know, I had some of the I call it mid school with some of the old school, some of the new school ways, but one thing was like, you know, prior man, we did kill ourselves who work. And so I say, kudos to a new generation. Now was saying, you know, priorities have to change. I mean, in the capitalism, you know, Capital has to move but, you know, there is more. There's balance and I know when I walked up on that, Kate or more ago, you know, it seems insane.

And at certain points through my process, I will often go back to review the last portion of work that I had completed to see if I had missed. Anything, once I have technically finished my overall project or arrived at my goal, I then go back to review everything. Once more and consider, whether anything could have been executed better. However, he's very traits that I considered to be my strengths naturally have their downside because I am sometimes overly This and therefore calls myself more time and stress than necessary to complete a given project. So, even if the final project product is satisfactory, these traits of mine can ironically hinder My overall efficiency. So I try to refrain from indulging my perfectionist impulses, while making sure that At the final product, the work that I deliver does meet the standards of the client."

I place a great deal of Merit in delivering work that accurately. Reflects my my own worldview and sensibilities and Creative Vision.

Somewhat hesitant about the situation because although I'm not opposed to the idea of compromise that is often entailed in a group effort because that often leads to some interesting results worthwhile results. I do find myself wondering, whether the final product could have been more satisfying for myself. If I Decide to yield to certain choices that were suggested by teammates.

But generally speaking, I tried to keep in mind, the idea that no one is perfect. And what may seem right her obvious to my Myself May strike someone as being the contrary and vice versa. I think business relationships are more likely to succeed with this mindset. I think I had to react this way in such situations because I was raised in different cultural background from most of my American peers, by which it came to feel to me as common sense that Maintaining a polite demeanor, even if contrary to my true feelings is the best way to handle myself in such situations."

Was not very organized because one of my defining traits is to be as organized as possible at all times this applies now not only to my physical work space. But also to my workflow for every individual project that I undertake, I think this is because As I mentioned previously, I was raised in a different cultural background from my American peers by which I came to strongly for you. That maintaining an organized approach to every facet of Life leads to Greater overall productivity stronger mental Clarity and a healthier lifestyle. And when I undertake a project, for instance, I make sure to arrange my Elves, whether I decided on those for myself or whether they came from the client, I arrange them according to their highest priority, which can change unexpectedly depending on certain factors. And I think that maintained ignore an organized approach to work is essential to a successful managerial role and I think it helps to build a strong overall team as well."

In that I am a bit of a perfectionist at times, at at all often, I'm often a perfectionist and I let that get in the way of things being done on time. I might need to take Take a little bit more time than others to complete something, but I always needed to be done to my standard and sometimes that standard is higher than what most people are satisfied with. So, it takes me a little bit longer to accomplish certain things, but I have to get it done to my standards and that's a weakness because sometimes you have to just do things as you're told and not to your own specifications."

And I'm also one who never says, no to a favor. Aye. Try to be as open and accommodating to my friends and family as I can if they require something, if they ask me to do something for them, I usually do it because these are people I value in my life and I care about and I want to do things to make them happy.

How much money I would make was when I turned down a particular promotion, a few years ago, that would have resulted in me. Making about 20%, more than I was currently making at that time. And I turned it down because It would have required a lot more of my time. All exclaiming Difficult about amount more time and would have required me to travel out of state, quite frequently and would have taken me away from my family, my friends. And it would have helped me In the long run, I believe because it would have set me up in a new position where I would have been making new contacts and new connections. But at that time I valued my time with my family and friends and I also valued living in the area I lived in because I was very happy there and very comfortable. And I tend to make those types of decisions because If I as a person, if I'm not comfortable with my surroundings, I just won't work as well. I won't function as well as a human being. So I need to make decisions that make me feel comfortable before I can make professional decisions. That will increase my status or the money I make."

I shake everyone's hand and when I'm first in a new group of people, I tend to not talk about myself a lot. I ask more questions about other people's lives and get stories out of them. Because I find that when you speak to people and try to connect to them on the basis of things that are going on in their life, they remember you more, instead of you telling them stories or going off about whatever tangent in your life. I find that trying to let people know that you're interested in their lives. Helps you connect with them on a deeper level than if you just spout about your own life?"

I mean, I got along just fine with everybody, but I felt so uncomfortable because most of the other employees in that department which isn't really where I wanted to be, or it wasn't doing what I was supposed to, but I was hired for, but most of them were late teenagers, still in high school, 20 year old son were 16 years old, I'm 44 years old and then the bosses were like the team leads. They were like my AIDS like in their 40s. But they annoyed me too because they acted like, they were so much better than everybody else working there, and just screamed orders at them. Which that's their job, is to give them orders, but they were so disrespectful and it's just, they annoyed me really bad and I went to college, but I feel like they looked at me because I'm 44 years old working. There, I feel like they looked at me like, I didn't graduate high school because I didn't tell them that and that just really bothered me. So I quit after a couple months. For that reason."

Are being a new group of people and to the to the team leads that were our supervisors when I was working at Walmart in the grocery department. The annoyed me because they feel like they had a big sense of superiority over the other people that are working there that they're above. In their role. And I mean they were whipping. Things are whipping stuff around and screaming and at this was like it was disrespectful and the people were working so hard in there. While these women are just screaming orders at them, it was just it was not a good place to work at all."

That I also work at part-time. So my workspace is my desk in my bedroom and I paint there and then beside there is on floor is like totes full of art, supplies of all different, kinds of stuff in I don't know when I use it. I just dig through it and typically I'm a very organized person. Every other part. My house is perfectly organized like to a fault. Almost, but not my art stuff. I guess that's like the area in my life. Where I feel that shouldn't be? I don't know. Maybe, I feel like I can like, let loose in that area, not be so restricted."

Generally I'm a very upbeat happy person typically I'm kind of quick and fast but in a good way I'm very efficient in getting the job done and very thorough if it takes a little extra time. So be it. I'm dedicated to to getting the job done to figuring out the process and completing the goal. So I think one of my weaknesses would be, maybe sometimes being a little too fast, a lot of times people tell me to slow down but my strength would be just being dedicated and very thorough and efficient though. I mean, I may be able to fast and sometimes that may not be the greatest thing but it does lead to me being efficient and me being able to multitask and do many different things at once and take on a variety of things at one time, and being able to get that done, it's going to make with me, being a better and efficient person overall in a better efficient worker."

Well, I think that she would describe me as a very loving person, who's really always there for people, who puts everybody else before themselves, and put themselves last a lot, which may, you know, always be a good thing. But that's just kind of my character. I think she would say that. I'm very talkative. I have a lot of energy. I'm usually very happy-go-lucky person. And again, just kind of always there for people. You can call me at any time and I'd be there. We can go my best friend and I we can go years actually without speaking which might sound kind of strange. But we do that time to time. Life just gets busy and then we'll pick up the phone and talk to each other again. And it'll be like we never missed a beat so just even though I we not talk every day, she knows that I'm always there for her. And I think she would say that, you know, I'm just one of those people that how much time has gone on. On no matter what life throws at us, that were always there for each other. And that's, I'm sorry that she can absolutely 100% unequivocally depend on. And I'm generally, just, that that type of person that no matter where you are, or what type of position or predicament you're in, you can pick up the phone and call me, and I'll do what I can to help you out or just to be there and listen to you or whatever you may need."

The most is when I was working as a dental assistant, I was working for a company where we strictly did root canals and there was a good job. It was a secure job, but the biggest problem was there was no benefits. So, I had no medical coverage. And at that time I had A illness called cyclic, vomiting syndrome, where I was in the hospital a lot. So even if I had been healthy, benefits are important. But for my situation, and position of the time benefits were extremely needed. And I love my job, I didn't want to be done with it, but I had to make a decision to find something that benefits in that was better pay. But in doing so you know I was afraid. If I let my feelings known truthfully to my employer at the time, he could just be like I don't want to deal with this and you're done, you know, so I could have been fired at the same time and then had no income. So I looked around first found a job that met the needs that I needed at the time with the benefits and better pay and he fought to keep me instead of firing me and offered me a raise. And I would have gladly accepted it, but it was strictly something that I had to do for my own benefit. My own welfare, my own health at the time. It wasn't, it wasn't a choice of just like, I like this job, you know, I want to stay. This one. So I ended up taking the other position but that is definitely a case where I had to make a professional decision where I could have affected my favorite"

When I joined a new group of people, I would definitely have to say when I took my dental, assisting classes that was pretty small. So I would say when I joined the bigger company that I worked for as a dental assistant, which was Aspen Dental and it was a pretty big team of people up. Until then I had only worked at really small you know, companies and not as a dental assistant at all. So when I joined that team, we were I merrily a little smaller. They're these know these as McDonald's are situated. All throughout the country. We have a handful in our state and I worked at two different offices and Two Towns, I really lived kind of smack dab in the middle of each Town. My primary office was in one but every now and then when they needed somebody to fill in and I was, you know, green and new as could be and didn't know a soul. So I had to become, you know, you know, friendly with the staff, which I became really close with and all the Ders at that office, and the office staff, in the manager, and all that. And then also at the other office. So it was a quite a team of people and then even when you got comfortable there, you kind of had to get used to corporate coming in and the bigger the bigger bosses coming in and meeting them and I mean, I've been there for months before I met them, so it was quite a team of people."

Generally, we all can give you annoyed with their co-workers at some point. And I felt that it was a years working anywhere, really, but working, I'll stick with the dental, assisting because I've been speaking about, I think just kind of all get on each other's nerves a little bit. We might do things a little differently. I know I had my way of working as opposed to others and, you know, we would just do something that would kind of just irritate the other one and then if Speaking in a private life. I thought I would say it's really easy to come up with cases of an audience where we been all stuck home together during this pandemic generally. I mean, for the most part I love being home with my family but I'll being cooped up in a small house, we all get on each other's nerves. I mean, my child partner. We're not used to being together this much. You know, she was in school, he was at work, I was at work or I was home. And now we're all together, you know? And it's not quite as bad as it was during the beginning of the pandemic. But You know, it's just leaving things out, not picking up after yourself. You know, it's all those things and I think, I mean, I have somebody doesn't get annoyed. I think it would be stranger. You know, when you are with with the people that you love the most all the time, you're going to get annoyed and like I said, it can be something which is not picking up after themselves at leaving something out, or just the simple things, you know, there's no great situations of annoyance. It's just a little things."

And my work space in here, which is my dresser. It is a disaster right now, it's Christmas time. So I have that all mixed into everything else and it's not a pretty picture.

I would say probably one of my greatest strengths is that I do care about my work and I am willing to put a lot of hard work into getting the correct result or the result that I'm looking for. Generally, I'm known for being a hard worker if you were to ask any of my fellow employees or Any of my previous bosses.

So I would say, if anything they would describe me as a sensitive person, I do try hard and sometimes I don't always succeed. So sometimes I get to me but, you know, it is good to have to get to have a good friends and good supportive, you know, input kind of coming and going. So yeah, I would say that that's That's probably how they would describe me.

How do you usually behave in such situations? And why do you think that is? Well, I can remember back. One job that I had many years ago, it was working for a retail shop and they implemented a new computer system. And I was one of the only people that knew how to use it. I was still new. I was, I was spending half the time learning and in the shop and the other half. The time I was spending with the the the franchisee basically, I'm learning how to use and implement this system. And you know how to become more efficient using it at the time there was a massive overhaul in what we call the flow of the shop. Basically it was we were changing aisles around. So where there would be one product here you know Nya one you know it's now on Aisle 9 or etcetera. Unfortunately, we had over, I think it was 150,000 skus and a lot of those were very small skus and it was just very Very confusing. So basically I had the owners of the store who did not understand this new inventory system very well. They didn't really understand everything that it could do and how efficient it can make this exact process that we were going through at the time. So the owners and the they were having the rest of the employees do everything. Being manually entering in everything manually by hand, it was just taking absolute tremendous amount of time. Basically the we were still open for business and when we're trying to do this and everything was a nightmare in the owners were very frustrated and it was just a mess. I did come in and I told them that this program that we were that we now had at our disposal. Was able to actually in, you are able to input all of these devices using a handheld device and it would actually automatically organize it for us and put it into a spreadsheet. It would make it so much more efficient and literally, all we have to do is just spend the time reading this spreadsheet, and adjusting, and moving the product as needed, the owners. They? They didn't agree with that. They did, they didn't trust the system. They didn't know it well enough. So basically, they told they told me no that they didn't want to do it that way, but yet they wanted to stay with the old way of, you know, the way that was causing the most chaos. So"

It's not because I don't want to I don't want to overwhelm people. I want to kind of underwhelm people and it's because I want to get to know the situation, kind of get the lay of the land, kind of learn people's, you know, the variety of different personality types and really try to get to know people better, whenever I join a new team and then after after we kind of get to know each other better I can. I kind of I don't know what the word is Blossom. Maybe the relationship from there, but I don't like to go in high-energy, you know, because sometimes people don't react very well to that. I myself, don't react very well to that. And so that's probably why. But yeah, I think it's really best to kind of get to know everybody first and then kind of develop, you know, the other professional relationships, you know, organically more or less it's kind of coming in artificially and just, You know it just really just kind of my style. It works best for me. It's what I'm most comfortable."

And I think that's kind of a skill that a lot of people should learn. In particular. I remember a situation at a shop that I work at where we would We have students come in as part of a class and they would shadow of in our job and kind of like a traineeship, I would say and we would basically show them the ropes of what we do in the shop. We try to, you know, give him some pretty simple tasks but still thinks that challenge them. I can remember in particular one student who came in and they just weren't They just weren't a good fit for us in the shop that we were at was very basic. Its hold on, you know, some pet supplies and you know, other other pet items. And I remember there were some bags of rocks that they use for fish tanks. And the problem with these rocks, these bags of rocks are about five pounds. Each, the problem was that they would often get knocked over customers. Would, you know, pick them up to look at them and you know, put them down and they went stack them neatly. So The common problem that we had with these rocks, were just always knocked over. So this particular challenging employee was kind of annoying because he seemed like everything that we gave him to do. He just absolutely could not do it, he tried he almost put more energy into being bad at something that he was and just even trying to do it. And I remember I was so annoyed because, you know what, what simpler task is there than stacking Little 5 pound bags of rocks and they're like, pebble rock. So, you know. So they stack very easy and I just remembered that, you know, I basically just had to step back out of the situation whenever I was there and I had to think almost like a teacher would dealing or maybe even a parent where you're probably. It's not that they can't do it, it's that they, that they won't do it. So, it's almost More of a psychological warfare, you know, just, you know, just to be kind of silly, you know, they were, they were there to not work and I needed them to work. But ultimately ultimately, I was the one who decided their grades"

In fact, most people that you would ask about me would say that I was organized. I do remember in one instance that I was the place that I was working on. We were having a tax audit done and the particular Department that I worked in was responsible for keeping receipts and I remember there was this this the audit that was coming up that my my boss just completely completely forgot about and he was actually out of town and called me up on the phone and told me that he needed receipts from, you know, it looked like three to five years back at the time, I forget exactly what it was but I remember, you know, it probably. Two desks in my office that we're just completely covered with receipts and paperwork. It was just, it was an absolute mess, you know, people would walk in and they would just turn around and walk out because they would see the frustration on my face. Yeah. So it was, it was not fun for me. I'm not a disorganized person in general and then actually found that once I became more organized and got everything in order and they say, you know, file That worked for me, I found that it was much better. But yeah, I being disorganized as not my not my usual mode so it was it was very tough for me."

I like to get to know people but I like to do it more on a one-on-one basis. I am not the kind of person who stands up in front of the room and tells everyone who I am and what I'm interested in. And the person who takes the opportunities, to have one-on-one discussions with people that I find interesting, or people who stand out to me as someone who is similar to me or in need of someone to talk to that sort of thing.

Sweet man. But he always wanted to talk to me in between calls and usually I wanted to just get to work and do what I was supposed to be doing instead of two chatting between calls because well, I do well on one-on-one conversations. I'm also highly driven to complete my work so I can't relax and enjoy a conversation with a co-worker. If I have work that needs to be done, so that was frustrating and I liked him as a person.

I usually Ali would talk to him for just a few minutes and Then sort of redirect and well, you know, that was a great conversation but I need to get back to work now."

It was frustrating for me because I like to have a clean desk and all my work is completed and I would go and I would take a handful. Full of files and go and sort them and put them in the files, whatever supposed to be come back and there's like just a pile of files across the top of my desk and it was, it was kind of a frustrating experience for me because a it meant that my work was really never done.

Why would say my greatest strength is the fact that I'm very good Under Pressure. I do not panic in situations. I've worked in restaurant kitchens for over 25 years. So yeah, typically I would have definitely definitely have to say that my greatest strength is I can handle just about anything emergency. That comes along work-wise, at least with my experience and kitchens and I don't panic, it doesn't matter. Whether there's a 25 top that walks in 15 minutes before closing. I can handle it, been there, done that. So, yeah, I guess it would have to be my greatest strength, would definitely be. I don't panic in rough situations. And my biggest weakness is an employee. I tend to like, people too much. Basically, at least of Cape became a problem and I was in positions of management which is one of the reasons why backed out of management completely basically, I like people too much.

I would definitely have to say that that would be with my decision, too. Stay out of management. Basically, there's no other way to basically put it on. Little bit on the older side, obviously, and with experiences, I've had I'm usually a lot of times and not so much on my part willingly push towards management. It's not what I want. I've done management for many years. All I want to do with my last job was just sit there and be a simple cook. I didn't want to run the kitchen So yeah, that pretty much affected my status when they approached me with management. I told them, no, I would not go into management. And trust me, they tried to bribe the heck out of me quite nicely, tried to bribe the heck out of me but I turned it down. Well, actually, I took a two dollar raise and kind of became like The Unofficial mom to put it as a better way, because there was a lot of teenagers working there at the time.

The fact that I came in there to basically clean house. I wasn't exactly greeted to nicely in the beginning. So basically, I just sat back and watched everything I asked the people to let them know. I'm just the new manager and I sat back and watch for a couple of weeks to see what was going on as a member of the crew. And then it went from there. That's my last experience with entering a new team. it's been a few years, but You know, when I enter when I go into a new place to work, I sit back and watch how it is and see how it goes. Why do I think I do that? Because I like to know what's going on before. I pretty much like to feel things out, let's just leave it at that. You get a really good idea just being quiet and watching"

I have seven children. I could go on for hours on that one situations at work. When people annoy me, I usually sit back and take a deep breath and try and see what's going on. I like to do that because I like to see and I like to make an informed decision before I react to a situation. If it's an employee that's annoying me. I'll figure out why they're annoying me and my experience. It's usually because one they don't know how to do something or to they need a day off. They don't know how to do something. I either show them how to do it or hook him up with someone that does. If they need a day off, I tell them to put the, put it in the Box, write it down, and put it in the box of my office. Basically, I like to sit there and figure out why they're annoying me. Because usually when their employees annoying me it's because They have a question. They don't know what they're doing or brunch or something such as figure out what it is and see what you can do to help them. If it's a customer annoying you then you just got to take a deep breath and deal with it."

Think of situations when your workplace so your workspace was not very organized. As I previously stated. I'm a kitchen manager and a cook Generally when you walk in everything is where it's supposed to be but that's basically before chaos hit shall we say? It starts there and basically, every night everything just totally gets trashed. Everything goes from being where. It's supposed to be two completely disorganized, or as I prefer to call it organized chaos, because it's not really disorganized you just kind of. Yeah. It was pretty much typical every every Friday and Saturday night things went to organized chaos but that's a kitchen. It's just a kitchen."

I just think it's important especially with the job I currently. Currently have now. We get so many tasks, so many times sensitive requests every week. So there's always a temptation to work as quickly as possible and get things done. On time. You don't want to cause any setbacks or have any issues with like for instance stores not getting the price changes that they need for the items that they have on time. But most importantly, you don't want these stores to get inaccurate prices. So you got to think about What's the most important issue here? And really, I've learned that you really just not only have to focus on the quality of your work. But I feel like one of my strengths that I've been developing since. I got brought up full-time with my team is to be able to focus on what needs to come first and kind of devised a sort of plan in your mind about how you're going to tackle each situation, especially in situations that are So stressful because you've got your being pulled in so many different directions. And with all these time-sensitive requests, and you don't want to let anyone down, you don't want to let your team down, you don't want to let your company down. So it's I think I'm good at coming up with plans on how to tackle, certain situations and just stay. I guess you could say just stay organized um, outside of work. I'm not typically the most organized person in the world, but I feel like Like in my job, especially since it is so important with the nature of the work that I do to stay organized. It's just easier to focus. On coming up with a plan and sticking to it so that I can make sure that all of my responsibilities are taken care of. So I feel like having subtle, that probably, my biggest strength is being responsible and probably one of my biggest weaknesses is maybe being too hard on myself and too focused on the little details sometimes, and just trying to be a perfectionist about every little thing and being just too hard on myself and forgetting that I'm human and and that he Evans are prone to making mistakes sometimes so"

I tend to be anxious because I have a generalized anxiety disorder that I have to take medicine for but I think on my good days I'm generally pretty laid-back and Not maybe not the most optimistic person in the world but more upbeat and able to handle things much better. Artistic and I like to spend a lot of time creating digital art. I haven't done it in a while because I've been so busy with everything lately and just I had a baby last January and he's almost a year old now, but it's still been. So exhausting having to adjust that and art, my sleep schedule is just not where I need it to be right now, and I'm not getting as much. It has, I should be ideally but yeah, I like to be in smaller groups or spend time in the comfort of my own home with family or just I'd rather be in like, one-on-one situations for the most part. If I am in large groups, it's fine. I'm just more reserved and I like to observe the conversations going around me and just be more. A listener. But of course if somebody does try to talk to me then I'll be friendly and I'll talk to them. So I guess that's kind of being an introvert in a nutshell and that's basically how I think he would describe me."

I would consider a big decision that would immediately have an effect on my status. It's just basically been my work in general and the kind of tasks that I've been responsible for of course there are certain things things that I can do or certain ways that I can handle the responsibilities. I have now that certainly would influence my status and honestly, my my employment Yeah, I have to make decisions on how to execute price changes for our company. So, if if I'm not careful with that, and I make the decision to just submit something without thoroughly, checking through it first, then that could definitely have a negative impact on my status. Whereas, if I stay on top of things, and I make sure that everything Is of the quality that it needs to be. I feel like that would have a really positive influence on my status and how much money I'd be making. So yeah, if I if I failed to do this or to do things in the way that's expected of me, then store to be getting wrong prices and we could be potentially looking at really big losses for our company, especially with some of the changes that I'm asked to execute. Yeah, I could. Be pricing things way too low if I have typos or if I'm not looking for mistakes. And and at least asking questions and getting these these issues resolved before before processing these changes. So I just generally had to be really careful in my line of work."

There's no doubt about that. The way I behaved, when I start a new job and I start working with a new team, as I'm usually super quiet and I'm trying to get a feel for everyone else. And Their personalities and how they behave with each other and maybe what their sense of humor is like. And if there's any room to be silly and, and lighten up the atmosphere a bit, That's something I do overtime. When I do become more comfortable with the people that I'm working with is I really will come out of my shell and it will just kind of feel like I never was like shy and reserved around them. It's it just takes me a while to adjust and to just get used to new people. I just like to spend the time observing them and just seeing where I can fit into that that puzzle and it's not difficult. I mean I am easy going, and there's really not much that would keep me from wanting to just blend in with them and work. Well, with everyone, it's just a part of my personality is just I'm naturally, it's hard for me to warm up to people, right away, especially since as an introvert, I have to think, before I speak, I can't I don't feel comfortable thinking Allowed or thinking as I speak, I like to feel like I'm prepared to say whatever it is that I have to say.

And other days I am a bit more anxious to the point where it feels like, every little thing just gets under my skin, and irritates me so much.

I don't have anything against being organized and general cleanliness, but just the way my personality is it stresses me out to focus on it too much and I do better in organized messes as long as I know where everything is. Especially if it's something that I use a lot and something that I know I'm gonna really need, and I'm gonna just freak out if I can't find it. If I know where it is, I'll be fine. And I just fall back on that and I've always been that way for as long as I can remember, my mom would always get all to me for having a messy room and it's just, she would say, how do you know where anything is in here? How do you find anything? And I'm like, I know where it is. I'm fine, I don't have a problem with it. It's, it's just My personality, I don't know how to explain it.

So a lot of that just happens through, observing the team in general, instead of being necessarily an aggressive participant. Definitely being active is good, but not Not to be overly in-your-face about it, but more just kind of take a backseat, see how the team interacts together and then kind of modify my behavior based upon that, this is just kind of the stance that I've taken. And it's worked for me so far, of course, I haven't changed teams. Since I started my initial job, I've been there for almost 13 years now, so it's been quite some time and I haven't had had to really start fresh with a new team at this point yet."

I frequently deal with annoying situations in the workplace, my the first thing that I do because I have that ingrained customer service. Skill set. I take a deep breath and I put a smile on my face, because when you're smiling your tone of voice normally sounds a lot more pleasant than if you're not smiling. And a lot of times just coming into a situation, from a positive stance or one where you're not, also frustrated and reacting, just instead you are Are responding to a situation works much better in the workplace. You are not coming in at heated and frustrated, but instead, you can think with the clear and level head and respond appropriately to the situation,"

I love organization and my space usually consists of some form of organization even if it doesn't make sense to an outside perspective, I usually have things set up or categorized and even color coded in a way that makes a logical sense to me, which is most helpful since I'm the one performing the work. But if I I were to come into a workspace that didn't have organization. It would be my joy to bring structure and organization to that space. Logically to just do something either by dates numerically or alphabetically, you know, whatever type of document or work it is that needs to be organized as where I would start or just get an assessment from everyone else who has been working there to find out, you know, Know what type of materials are most frequently used and maybe what could even be archived?"

And I like challenges, I like to Explore the limits of my intellect and my ability to problem-solve. I've always taken pride in those types of things when it comes to my weaknesses, as an employee because of my dedication to tasks and task management. When somebody comes to me for help, even if they're in another department, if I am able to assist them, it is very hard for me to say, no. I I do like the variety of being involved in different departments it because a lot of my past careers have dependent on me, being very multi, task oriented and being able to work across different departments and with different people in the organization. So I enjoy helping other departments and other people with their tasks but it just depends on The urgency of my priorities, that I not get distracted. That I not give too much of my time and energy to the people who are not directly related to my sphere of influence, my authority, my job description, if you will. So I would say my that would Encompass my greatest strengths and my greatest. Weaknesses is my tendency to dive headfirst into a test can stay with it until it's complete."

I'm, I like to approach new people, especially interesting looking people, people who look like they have very unique characters histories, they can really add a lot to the conversation. I do like celebrating people's unique characteristics. Personalities experiences, education's. I just I love variety. I love people. And so when I go out with my friends, we tend to get big groups of people together. For instance, when we go to a Renaissance festivals, we get a huge Caravan of people that go, we all dress in costume and well, A lot of us are like the nerdy gamer type of people and so like I have a lot of asea friends and LARP friends, and d, and d and Pathfinder and BattleTech, kind of friends. And so, yeah. We all go in costume and in character, well, even like nerd out and have our backstories and, um, but anyway, so yeah, I tend And to, but you know, that's, that's not the limit of my friends. I have a lot of friends in the business Community, because I've been an entrepreneur for 20 30 years. I've, I'm a member of lots of Chambers of Commerce and mmm, other organizations. And so I'm a certified rock climber. I, I never sit still, so most of my friends would just say, I'm fun, because I always come up with something living room. I do is really nice because there's always like white water rafting and hiking and well I have horses. So horseback riding is really big but yeah, fun and never a dull moment. I suppose would be a good description of when I'm hanging out with my friends."

I try to stay abreast of historical data and I mean sometimes your blindsided but for the most part you can see situations coming up that you're going to have to make decisions on. And so I love researching, I like knowing what's going on and I like being able to make informed decisions on On the Fly and I have also found that when you use intuition and historical data, you usually make pretty good decisions. But yeah that intuition it's kind of magical in the way that like I just I get a gut feeling and I really am hard pressed to remember a time when that got feeling did not pay off. But, let's see. In the question about how much money you make success, is not always just about the money. At least not at the time. I had mentioned, I man, I've been an entrepreneur for years. Hmm, and if you look at the like Lean Startup model for businesses, his I've had multiple businesses, a lot of it's about the learning curve about getting your MVP out there in about learning how to Serve. The clients are looking to serve and that requires a lot of feedback and a lot of times, the feedback is more important than the money especially if you want return customers and you really want to solidify your customer base. So when it comes to decisions, yeah, my goodies available on prolific, I do appreciate the responsibility. That's been put on me to make decisions that People trust me enough to make decisions my husband. One of them and I like watching decisions. Hmm, prosper and to watch, you know the feedback the the research pan out. If you will on what I decided with the information that's been given me."

I've been brought in for one reason or another and a lot of times that's been so that I could head up a pilot program. So even if They've been playing around you know like organizing a team. They'll bring me in to head up that team or continue filling out the team by recruiting people. So, I tend to be, I tend to try to just listen to everybody in the team, the ideas that they've come up with the direction that they've decided on, before I got there, If there was one, you know and I just want to get a feel for who are the more emotional people. The ones that are the more more rational logical people than ones, who are the go-getters, the ones that are the, like, support Personnel. But I usually end up in a lead position. I try and enjoy die, too. I'd like to see what the other side is, like, but being a people person being a talker if you will. That's kind of how I find myself is in more of like an educational purpose, it a teaching position. Again, it does help to come in do because you're seeing things from a fresh perspective. When a lot of times when these available on prolific, when a group is stuck, it's they Make their way out of a wet paper bag because they all have their Paradigm paralysis, but you bring in the New Perspective and it can break through that a lot of times. And so and not just that like even if that's not the case by being quiet and sitting back and listening to everybody else that's on the team, you can try to formulate the best next steps for whatever. Our purpose, this team is has been established. So, um, yeah, that's that's what I generally do. If the entire team is new, it's so much fun. Everybody's pumped and excited. And I really feed on that energy and I love that energy. And if it's if it's a team that's established and it's just new for me, I like that challenge too. Because again, I love to meet new people and And to learn new situations, I consider myself a constant student of life and all aspects of it. So,"
6282e2e2479eff12a562838c_q5_c1_1672690271_54495a0d-9047-4f94-a180-e4623b091c96,"One of the things that I find most annoying if we're talking about pet peeves, is when people project is, if they are speaking from a place of Education or authority and they are completely uninformed. And when that happens, what I tend to do, instead of calling them out on, it is to redirect, maybe pull them apart from Um everybody else or you know if we're in a one-on-one situation and I will guide them to the information that they need so that they can see where there are is and maybe correct their thinking and if that doesn't work, I will sit down with them and we will go over the material together. But in, you know, some people just cannot be convinced. A lot of people just have these ideas in their head and it doesn't matter how much proof you show them, you know? Yes, gravity has no effect on it, keeping things grounded in their mind. You just, luckily, I don't really deal with too many of those people at least not in a All setting maybe in Social and you know political and settings like that but yeah, professional settings. Usually I can grab ahold of these people me like hey let's go, let's go check this out, you know, come with me and so We'll look up the information and they can see why I pulled them out of the team to have this conversation. And then, you know, maybe if this happens enough times, they'll stop for lack of a better term, embarrassing themselves. Because that's, that's one of the biggest annoyances to me when people are publicly embarrassing themselves either, you know what they're doing in what they're saying. And again, I like everybody to be friends and a lot of times that could be more than just annoying, it can be insulting to some people. So, I try to quell that whenever that comes up in conversation."
6282e2e2479eff12a562838c_q6_c1_1672690517_54495a0d-9047-4f94-a180-e4623b091c96,"Well this question hits close to home. Um, I cannot stand this organization. I can't function in it. It's like like white snow in my brain. I so a bit it's a double-edged sword because for me organization is not just how cleared off my desk is to me, organization is what's in the filing cabinets? What's in your portable hard drive, what's in your three-ring binders? And so More often than not. If I decide my office needs an overhaul, it will look like a tornado, hit it because I will take the time to go through everything and like reorganize and get rid of old client files. And and like just, oh, get find all the tax stuff and get that put away, and make sure that that's ready and waiting for, like, that time. And just, yeah. So it's funny, if my office looks like it's hit by a - it's actually in the process of being extremely organized which isn't isn't too often, but it's this is a funny question because yeah, I'm one of those people. I, I really like an organized, not just desk, but office, I feed on my environment and my environment needs to be clean aesthetically pleasing. I have a huge background and design like my first First degree was in fashion design. I do you know, digital design architectural, I worked for an architect for a while. Interior design. I've done jewelry design Kabul re everything. Yeah, it has to be aesthetically pleasing organized. I like it can be asymmetrical to a degree, but yeah, I need I need order and I need a logic in my environment."

So generally I think I'm somebody who usually thinks outside the box so I'm usually able to come in to maybe a difficult situation and look at it from a different angle and provide different ideas. That might not be readily Apparent from the get-go, I would say for the weaknesses side. So whenever I have a performance evaluation, I always ask For what is something that I can work on and some feedback that I have gotten, is that there are some times that I like to say where there's analysis paralysis where there are too many options and it's hard for me to pick one and go in that direction. So that's something that I've definitely been working on and to be more confident and being more assertive and choosing an option and just going with it, if it's not the right option, that's okay. Will learn from it and we'll continue on it. Sometimes you just got to be confident in your ability and just go in a certain direction with it."

And it's always has a smile on my face. I am somebody who is adventurous and likes doing things that maybe the average person might not want to do. Like I solo travel around the world, I have hiked Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. So I'm somebody who enjoys you know a little bit of risk and spice in their life. And I think they would describe me as somebody who's intelligent that. I enjoy looking at things and figuring out how they work and somebody who can in, put my thoughts, anywhere and give ideas. So they would definitely describe me as somebody who is intelligent adventurous and just positive in general."

So I don't think there is a time really, in my job, where I've had to make professional decisions that affect my status, or how much money I make other than, maybe, applying for promotion to be a supervisor, which I have done. I think maybe picking this line of work that I did from college. I had to make a decision of maybe wanting to go into a more stressful environment and make more money or go the route of less stress more freedom but not make it too much money. So that is the route that I went because I've always said that I don't want to sell my soul for money. I want to have that freedom to enjoy life and explore. And this allows me to be passionate about the place I work because I have that freedom that work-life balance where I think. I went in the other direction, the stressful environment, where I made more money, it would burn me out. And I would grow to resent that. So, there's one instance where I have had to make a professional decision. And it affected, how much money I make. And potentially my status. I think they're both very good jobs, but some people might be more impressed, but I went the other direction."

It's an ever-changing environment to teams where every year or maybe even more than that we are constantly put on new teams and have to work with new people. And I think in those situations, I really try to make the other people feel, welcome. And feel like that, I am somebody who is approachable. They can come to me. Me with questions at any time and I can help them with work. I try to be friendly try to be nice and welcoming to everybody and help them. Maybe if they're lacking and some knowledge and I do this because if I am approachable, if I am hopeful then I think that just creates a good team environment where everybody feels like they are included and we can all work on a project together to succeed and get the work done."

So I tend to be somebody who it doesn't get annoyed easily, I tried to accept everybody's viewpoints and where they're coming from. But if somebody is like being argumentative or bringing down the mood or is complaining a lot, like that is something that it would begin to annoy me and I would try to address that with the person privately Wait, to see where their issues are coming from until we resolve this. Because I think, if one person is bringing down the team environment, and that just brings down everyone and work will grind to a halt. And so, I feel that if you are able to address that with them and talk it through, then everybody's going to benefit in the end."
628510a698e9e63b21ef9139_q6_c1_1673119976_bafda620-a520-4ba5-af70-4781820d52ff,"Typically, my workspace is actually pretty tidy, but in my course of the job, I had to manage a lot of projects and there are times that are much busier than others and, you know, sometimes the inbox can be filled with emails and it takes time to go through and address each one of them or I'll be given papers and they'll be sitting on my desk for a while. So occasionally there will be clutter that happens on my workspace but then usually every maybe month or two, they'll be a slow time where I'm able to address all the emails. I'm able to clear all the papers and I kind of had that like reset moment where I'm able to clean up everything and Center myself again on the work and then do it all again, when we get back into that busy season."

I generally tend to think of the team first or the the company goal first before my own needs, ideally it would be a win-win. Like, what would be good for me would be good for Or the company. And that case I would behave in a way that was best for both of us. If I had to choose though I would put the team or the company above my status or how much money I make. And I think that's because it matters more to me to be a team player and a reliable employee. Then making a little more money or having a certain status."

You know what, I can add.

I don't, I don't think that. I communicate like my eye needs very well, especially when I'm working with a team. And so sometimes I fall short on projects because I may be taken on too much, but don't worry, I'll ask somebody else to help me. I don't think it's like a pride thing. I think it's just like I think I can handle an all night. I can't because I think that's probably one of my biggest weaknesses."

One of them made more money and was in a setting that I didn't wasn't particularly excited about and another one offered less money, but it was in a setting that I really wanted to work in. I was really torn in the decision but ultimately I decided to make less money and work in a setting that I wanted to work in. And I think that I behaved that way I would have chose that because at the end of the day, I cared more about What I did all day, maybe more than than what the income discrepancy was. If the income discrepancy was bigger, I might have made a different decision but I think I kind of do think a little bit more about like my happiness and the quality of life rather than my income."

And like, Ask questions about them. I don't have a great reason why I made like that. I think I just tend to, like, kind of get the feel for, like, a new team, or any group of people.

And typically those situations I very Giving and I just kind of given to it and I let them ask the questions. I may be some more time like I'm with them where I need to or where I feel like they knew me to recently. In this situation, I drew boundaries and I said we're going to discuss this only when you're in the office and when we can talk about these things and then I was really firm, especially when I had answered other questions before. Maybe they ask the same thing or maybe they were trying to go off on the same thing and I was like this is a weird you talked about this. This and I think that's because recently I've learned that I think I need to like draw more personal boundaries and I need to establish. It was a more dominant but I need to take the lead a little bit more in terms of like my relationship with my clients and so being a little bit more firm in how I deal with business.

And if I make a mistake that I'm able to figure out a way quickly to remedy it, and fix it, even if it involves me having to admit to my peers that I've made a mistake, but weakness that I have is sometimes I work too hard, where I get too focused, and I might lose track of other tasks, just because I'm trying to accomplish a main like Center task, but another weakness probably my ability to sometimes not be able to have a good track of time. Sometimes this kind of goes with my other weakness but sometimes I'll just get distracted by working too hard on a task and I lose track of time and that might impact work slightly but it's never bothered me too much.

Not I guess hide my problems if I'm having any Also, I guess my friend would describe me as courageous because in certain social situations sometimes, you know, I've been the person to take the step forward and initiate conversation and have a good thing come from that or things come from that depending on the situations.

I normally behave with a lot of thought behind my actions, in regards to achieving more status or achieving more money. Consider myself pretty calculated. So for instance, when I was a manager at a tobacco store I was able to determine certain employees that we had hired that would not really fit long-term and of hadn't won't hand to help the store owners decide on who to let go, and who did not let go. And that, I think helped my status in the eyes of the owners to show them. I can make tough decisions and also build trust with the owners. And yeah, in the end it helped me get a promotion. So,"

Bob, and what they expect out of me as a teammate, just so I can also sell set self expectations.

Get everything right, you know, and sort of take care of people and make sure that they get what they need. But what they need. But when it comes to small details, sometimes if you pay attention a little too much, you might end up getting into other people's like personal space or you might end up doing more than what. It's needed to the point where it's just it's more efficient to actually do something else. So I would say that is my strength, my greatest strength and also my greatest weakness. As far as that goes, I've been I would I would say that It's easy to sort of flip a switch and fix it a bit, but that would be my greatest strength and weakness right there."

Extremely honest, brutally honest, I don't like, you know, telling lies about stuff at all, to be honest. If you ask me a question, I'm going to give you the answer. If I don't know the answer that I'm probably going to either. I'm either going to find it or I'm going to tell you I don't know that's why I tell you, I don't know. Well then I will try to find it but that is how My best friend. Would describe me? Extremely honest. That is the first thing that would come to his mind. Another thing, my friend would probably describe me. As is reliable typically, reliable. If you ask me to do something I'm going to do it and get it done. So I would say those are like the two Strunk like strongest points. I could think of immediately that he would think of Past that I honestly think those are the two things that he would describe me as for the most part."

So for example, if I'm taking a higher status job, I'm trying to think of okay, how is this going to change my life? Am I going to be able to do this the best way? Am I the best person for this job? How would I be able to? You know, make others believe that I am the best person for this job and be efficient at it, at the same time. So we had behave in those sort of situations. When I'm making, those decisions is trying to think of it, critically and straightforward. If I don't believe I can actually do something. I will say, hey, this person probably better for this. Or if I believe that I can do it and I'll say, okay, I will I'll do it. I may not know exactly how to do it at that time, but I will figure it out and I will become the best person for that job. Even if I'm not at that moment, I would say the reason I think that way is because I like having sort of an order of things. Like, I like a standing, you know, being a higher status is great and making more money is great. But what's better is having things run smoothly, and if I need to be in a lower position to do that and for a while, at least I will do that, I don't want to be in a higher position in screw things up. That's not the way, I think any business should work. So if I'm the best person, Or the job. I'll let you know if I'm not I'll let you know, it's as simple as thinking critically and being realistic about it."

Like, for example, my co-workers, my team of people, then I will sort of start mingling with them a bit, you know, not not anything. Where it's You know, messing up the flow of things, but I will do that in order to sort of build a bond and relationship with these co-workers who I'm going to be, you know, spending a lot of my time with an order to sort of make things more efficient, they trust me and because of that then we can actually do things a little bit better. So I would say that's generally how I behave when I enter a new team. I sort of focus on getting myself good and ready so I'm not messing anything up. Yep, I'm making sure everything runs smoothly and whatnot, and the once everything does run smoothly, I start developing those bonds a bit more, so it gets even better than that."

Generally when someone is annoying me or trying to annoy me, it's very hard to get me to that point in the first place. But the way I'd react I wouldn't really react much at all. I'd sort of smile at them and be like, okay that's fine. And then end of conversation I go back to whatever work I was doing. generally I think that's the best way of doing things when you're in like a sort of any sort of position because it's you're acknowledging them, you know you're hearing what they're saying. They feel like you are paying attention to them and you're understanding what they're saying but you're also sort of putting the conversation down so you're not, you know, it's not getting any worse. You're not really engaging with them more than you have to, in order to make sure things are still working smoothly. The way I would say her the way I I think I the reason I think that way is because generally when it comes down to it you don't want to start any sort of argument in a working environment, you want to sort of, make sure things just run smoothly and everyone gets along. So when it comes down to annoyances it's mainly just don't take it personally. They're probably not doing anything on purpose to actually trying to hurt you or annoy you. So they're just trying to do their job just like everyone else."

I get like a rush of things. So if something happens, we have like a lot of work just going on on on then I might get a little bit disorganized throughout the day which is honestly fine. It happens. It's impossible to stay completely organized all the time as long as I don't stay that way, you know. So I would say as far as that goes typically I'm typically an organized person. If you see me unorganized anything like that, I will generally by the end of the day, usually not even then in a couple hours. I'll have my workspace organized. Again, I tend to be very like, Lynn Lindley person clean person. I don't really like the idea of having a dirty space at all, because it just really affects your mind. It affects like the way you think about stuff and and how you work, it affects pretty much everything else. You have a disorganized life, you're not going to have a good time at all. So any sort of organization you can put in any sort of work space, any sort of place is just going to help you?"

And I like to look at all sides before making a decision, I don't consider myself to be a fence sitter, even though it appears I give off the appearance of fence sitting a lot. It's just I like to have all the information from all sides before I make any type of decision and by what I mean as far as not. Having a lot of pride is that, I guess capable of saying I'm both capable and also, I enjoy changing my mind. I very much actually enjoy being wrong. I would be happy to be wrong 10,000 times in a row. If it was lead to, to a breakthrough to something that would help others, make things easier. And so that's, that's what I mean by my pride, and I'm happy to be wrong, I like to be wrong. Like to also give others the credit. I don't like compliments, I have problems with him. I don't know why. I try to be Grace Grace, graceful, accepting them, I believe, but I'm grateful. And that, that's not what I was saying. Gracefully blood town and probably those and that's probably my biggest weakness is accepting compliments. I tend tend to hide a bit. I also I'm not good at small talk. I'm not good at it. Parties, I do talk, especially once you get me started on the topic, I will talk a lot until you show me up. However, Small talk is very very difficult for me and it's so difficult for me that if something that people are saying he's just doesn't interest me though. I try to focus. I will tend to yawn and I try not to be on but I don't know why it just happens. Let's see. And that's my greatest strengths and weaknesses."

Dependable yet, not in a Dependable way, I'll come through. I just often failed to do well with very strict timelines, especially if there's something that needs to be correct and new ideas are coming in. I like to look at them. Before making a decision. And therefore, I tend to tend to delay making important decisions if I don't have all the information, I don't like assumptions or guessing my best friend would tell you that making a guest causes me consternation and that I will confess straight up and it suggested that I don't believe it should be acted on. And then, I mean it to be a Something to be discussed, not something to be acted on. Because my best friend would probably also tell you that simulates, something a little story. I like to use a lot, is that, you know, a compound is find, you know, but once you throw that stone and that's, that's you making a decision. And if you're basing it on and assumptions assumptions in that, once that Sun hits the water, there's no, bring those ripples back. And so I don't need to be exact. I don't need, I'm not as much a nitpicker but to Make a course of action and to follow a course of action. I don't like to do that based on guesses. Guess he's caused me transformation and that's what my best friend would tell you. And I'm actually not sure what I'm at. I'm going to hit stop. I'm not sure if I got to a minute or not.

Things aren't very important to me. Everything I have, it's fits in a car, midsize car will fit everything. I own, however, doing the right thing is important to me, especially when as Java IDE like apis, which is, which are often used as a foundation for, for many software packages and I believe that Foundation needs to be strong, It needs to be robust, it's got to be able to handle. It doesn't need to just be able to handle what has been designed for that kind of stuff needs to handle. More because technology is constantly pushing the limits. And so I make a lot of decisions when, when I was in my life, I made a lot of decisions in my last job at not so much cause feature creep, but protected the future of the software, but it did delay things. I've worked lots of overtime for no additional money. I also don't like compliments. I mentioned that in an earlier question. And because of that I do like to give credit to date to anyone but myself and so that cost me a lot of money and if if I'm actually short changed from never bring it up, I'm happy to be sure. I don't want to alkalize, I want to be able to keep working. I like to be able to keep looking at the problems and solving them and moving forward that way. Status doesn't doesn't matter much to me.

I can be tough to get to know. However, once once the creativity starts flowing and do become rather, I would say exuberant, I become optimistic, the more I get think more, more things I get wrong, more ideas, I realized don't work. The more confident I get I would say I'm like, what? I'm like a little kid that way. I never lost the the idea that my parents instilled in me that you know, you learn from your mistakes and so I have that exuberance as a kid where no matter what what happens when it's my turn to play and I play, and then, my turn is over. It doesn't matter. If there's heckling laughing, doesn't matter behind me. I don't care. The first thing out of my mouth is, oh, gimme, one more try. Now, I really know what to do because you know how bad it myself. It shows you what I love making mistakes. And very I don't hide my mistakes and teach my nephew's don't hide your mistakes. Let everybody see him. And I don't become flustered by my mistakes and that causes sometimes in teams that causes me to look arrogant, or me to look like I'm never wrong. In the fact, is that You know, I try to show that you know what, I don't want the credit and I love being wrong and it's not so much that I'm not wrong. She said I'm happy to be wrong because I'm going to learn from it and I'm going to call it out when I'm wrong. And now one-on-one, if somebody else is wrong, that's not something I'm going to bring up in public. It's not something I'm going to allude to, and I'm going to be very careful with my speech when that happens and it's something I'll talk to them about privately, if I think, it's that important. And but it's not anything that I would ever. I don't burn people, you know I don't do that. I don't like strip flips. I'm people like that's not be used to be not anymore.

And let's forget that there was ever a A compliment because I'm not, you know, I'm not, I'm not trying to lose. I'm really not looking to move up any ladders. I'm looking South problems and To teach all of a sudden have pride, in is something that that was built is is annoying. I know myself the most, when that happens because then all of sudden, I start building the wall and yet everything I might have built this building built on what somebody else has done.

There's always room for improvement, another one one one annoyance I do have that if you have trouble with and it doesn't make me angry or mad, it makes me annoying.

And I'm at a loss for the word when it's not when it can be, what is not clear. And everybody else anybody's watching this knows the word that I'm looking for. So I'm pretty confident that and I'm gonna miss out there. Somebody give me taking multiple ways and you can't you cannot reasonably or logically decide which way that's annoying to me.

There's a blanket Covering workspace, it's not organized at all and the same time. I know where everything is. I like clutter. I don't like having a lot of stuff. As I mentioned everything I own. I'm not going to turn the camera around, but everything I own is in this room, everything I own easily fits in the backseat of a sedan And yet it, I like being a small room, I like clutter and I like everything at hand. Every notebook that I've got got notebooks all over the place and I got pens all over the place. Because when I need to put on Assad, I like to write it down by hand. With append prepend wishes with a pilot G Dash to pain. I love using multiple colors. And I like to have the pennies and everything at hand. I have basically wherever I work, my big boost, you can build a nest and then on the outside of the nest is everything within hands, reach, whatever it is from energy drinks to Coffee to, you know, to my phone to everything. Everything I needs within hands, reach. I like clutter and it doesn't look organized, but I can tell you exactly where the energy drink is. I can tell you where my Coffee is I know. Pen scissors, like the decisions. I got everything everything at hand. and so, but my workspace is never look organized at all. hence the blanket and the very good book on top of the blanket not to good book, but engine So it's not as good as anyways. It's the last questions and I'm being very talkative, as I said before, once you get me going, you get me going. And now, it's 100% done. I don't want that to 30-second warning to come back up. So I'm gonna say goodbye. Thank you very much for the interview."

I can get I guess pretty like focused on a certain things so I don't know if there's like like maybe. I'll I'll have like one issue come up. And that's That's the only thing I could focus I guess I have trouble multitasking sometimes. I think typically I'm a pretty good employee like a hard-working.

Well, and why do you think that is? I feel like I've be behave pretty seriously and that is my main focus. It's it definitely it. It brings out a different side of working side that I guess growing up. You don't always like no you have I guess usually I don't know why do I think that is I think that is because It's very impactful on your life. Money. Even if you don't want to make it, everything is a big part of of life and it affects how your life goes.

Get like that one person that invites you to the team. That's that's where you start. That's your link and you build from there and but it's it can be awkward. It can be given like, give you anxiety and it can be. It can be kind of difficult sometimes. Why do I think that is is because generally people are people are kind of Of people are hard to deal with. I mean it's a it's a big part of life but it can be, can be give you some anxiety can be can make you anxious. There's a lot that goes into it and also these these people are already there they're established with each other already and you being somebody new is They're all it's weird because they're already like LinkedIn together.

I mean of course if it's something goes too far and there's a certain level of disrespect I feel as though like you could act differently but most regards when someone is annoyed me in the workplace, you just kind of you have to take these sorts of things on the chin. And just get through it, and maybe speak to your advisor manager later on afterwards or shoot them a message. I would, I would say afterwards, actually, just get through your shift, get what you need to do, as an employee dumb and I don't know. You need to do your best to dsq. Deescalate at least. That's what we're what I usually feel like. I've seen I've seen some pretty heated arguments in the workplace and that usually never result in anything good. So you got it. You probably had a break-in point when this happens. So it's not it's it's own or maybe you're in the wrong spot because too far. But I think why I really like this is because I take my work seriously and I would So like have a reputation of good character and being like being a genuine person. I don't think there's any place for sort of sort of altercation in the workplace on this. Like I said, sometimes things can be able to wear but"

And so with that being said, I don't I don't feel like an unorganized workplaces, very typical of me, you know, I think that's because, like, I've stated previously, I do take my work seriously, and, you know, it's, I don't think it's okay to be late by, by anytime. Like, I think five minutes, early should have to go, you should go for. And for me, I'm honestly, I'm usually earlier than that. And I think, Being on time. If you can get that down, it's not hard to be organizing your workplace because that means you already taking your job. Seriously, if you arrive early, not even on time, if you arrive early that's a big part of it. I think it all kind of works together and yeah,"

I don't want to be the person who isn't carrying their weight in a situation. I always want to I always want to be seen as someone who, who works hard and who is willing to take on whatever is necessary to get the job done. Typically, I am a person who management will reach to if if they need something. Hey, can you, can you do this for me? Can you take care of this? Can I have you take on this project? Whatever. one of my weaknesses is that I am also easily distracted, the job that I do currently involves a lot of reading and it used to be that I had paper to hold in my hand could use a highlighter to highlight my responses or to highlight what I, what I had observed and now it's all online which is wonderful for the fact that I can From home. But being all online and electronic, I don't have paper to physically Holt and I have found that it's a struggle for me to stay super focused with all electronic work so that part's hard.

Intuitive and understanding as far as. What they need and how they're feeling and why they feel the way that they feel. I I'm the kind of person who might originally kind of react to a behavior. Sort of this sort of my first knee-jerk response is, you know, why are you reacting to a behavior? But then beyond that, my next, my next thing is to try to figure out why somebody I was behaving the way that they are. Why did they say that? What what makes them Talk that way. What makes them feel that way, that sort of a thing. So I'm I'm kind of a person who likes to dig a Little Deeper to understand. Why someone's feeling the way that they're feeling and try to figure out how I can, how I can help if they, if they're sad or they're stressed or whatever? I, I try to figure out how I can help. That's, that's the kind of person that I am. I care about other people. I don't have a huge circle of friends, but the friends that I do have our are extremely important to me for the saying I would rather have 100. I'd really rather have four quarters than 100 pennies and that describes me. Well I treat I treat my friends. I treat my friends.

But situation where I made a professional decision that could affect my status or how much money I make. I the company that I work for, was founded by three gentleman and Many years ago, they made a decision to sell the company. So to to other companies, came in with capital, but them out and we ended up with a CEO and a board of directors things we've never had before there was quite a difficult transition, The recession hit in 2008, was at eight or nine? and, Everything was kind of a mess at that point. I was Sitting in a boardroom had to sit in on a board meeting and our new CEO was talking with the new actuary that he brought in. And he was saying something that was concerning to me. He was saying don't tell the founders about this and I was very loyal to the founders and I went and talked to them about what I had heard that could have affected my job by could have been fired.

How do I usually behave when I enter a new team and why I am More of a, my personality type is more of I don't just jump in. I'm More introverted, more cautious, more shy.

And then when I have something to contribute then I will contribute but I don't have a need to come in and own a room and I also am not the type of person who's going to fight to be heard. I will try to make suggestions, but if it's It's chaos.

I try to be very patient with people who annoy me and I try not to let My frustration show, I do know that I do wear my emotions on my face and so it probably does show but I am not the type of person to take a tone with someone so if someone is annoying me I'm not going to snap at them. I'm more of a kill them with kindness kind of a person so I will. Do my very best to keep a smile on my face and to not let my frustration show. I sometimes it doesn't get me anywhere but I mean dealing with rude people I, you know, pretend like I don't notice and Sometimes by the end and the person who was rude at the beginning is no longer being rude at the end.

I, I like to be organized, but I also have a tendency to kind of put things in piles and You know, think say that I will get back to them later and so, my whole world is kind of a constant. process of getting organized and then getting kind of cluttered and then getting organized again and it's easier for me to stay organized when Things are less chaotic. I think that the more, the more busy, my life is or the more struggles that I'm facing at the give any given time. Tends to lead to me.

I am not very good at being able to be organized. Although my wife finally introduced me to a smartphone and now, you know, anything that ever pops up to me. I can actually use my calendar and I can put like important events or timers and things like that are also saying being kind of this hard with people, I've just had so many people in the past kind of you can ignore to me and I tend to want to like shut everybody out instead of just, you know, shedding those people out and kind of keeping the good people close to me, a great strength, would be being a hard worker, very loyal. You know, I work till the end like that even whenever there's problems. Yeah, I get mad along the way, just like anybody else, but I feel like I'm able to get it out and I give up too easily."

I don't really have a lot of like close friends. I have a lot of people that I just kind of know things like that and you know, just like anything with a friendship, you have to kind of build on and things like that. It doesn't just happen out of thin air. You have to work at it just like anything you want in life. Like, my relationship with my wife, or my kid. I brought some friends describe me, I guess would be my wife say that I'm funny. And Effie, I would say, I don't take myself too seriously, but sometimes I go from one end to the other kind of like, Jekyll and Hyde. I'm one of those people that are loyal to a fault, but whenever you're around me, I tend to kind of dismiss you and be done with you. Also a huge animal lover animals forever reason. I'm like dr. Dolittle and I can't speak to him, but I'm I'm pretty good at if you know, I've never even seen an amble for I can kind of go come up to him and Get to know them and they'll come right up to me. Like I've known the whole life. So And then I love music. We got a lot of concerts. So try to be well-rounded like that and very analytical, I guess would be another one."

And so my dad was always Let's say it was hard on me. He loved me, but he's kind of hard on me. But one thing that I remember him talking about was the kind of job I wanted. I think it was like 10 years old and at the time my dad was a teacher at Mizzou University. Missouri top marketing. And he basically sat me down and asked me like what kind of Life do you want? And I kind of told my want to have this and that and I want this kind of car and a house and a wife and I wanted a few months off. And he's like, well what do you think about doing my job? And I was like, well I kind of do like you come home, you share stories, things like that. So, So so that you know that story like that kind of got me in the foot in the door. I guess you say about wanting to pursue teaching and from there I never look back I've always stayed true to my guns and been doing that. And says, how do you usually behave in such situations to me? Money is important obviously you know with covid and post covid. Everything is costing so much so yeah. I mean you can't be so foolish even if you're passionate about it unless you want to do as a hobby you need to find a job that you can actually make enough money to support you and your family. You know, you can't be so silly about just trying to pick a job. You just love without any money, but I love doing what I do as a teacher myself. It's rewarding things like that. So I would have to say something I find passion. I mean there's plenty of people who say, majority of people hate their jobs and don't like it. I like it for the most part, they might make more money than me, but when I get Summers off, but to I make enough to get by, but I build relationships. And, you know, that's the big thing with me. Hey, kids, I graduated, actually, stopped me and, which is a rarity and stores and things like that. Say, Hey mr. Clark. Mark actually come out of their way, drop what they're doing and doing that. So like for me that's very much of an honor and I enjoyed every relationship that I have whether it's good or bad."

The entire School District. I work for. I work for a very big school district right outside of st. Louis, and I think we have like, 14 Schools and I think there's only six of us an entire building our entire School District. I do what I do which is basically kids, they get in trouble. I have some like last the entire day, I do middle school, but they basically get treated like Elementary There there the whole day work and I kind of helped tutor him. How do I usually behave when you enter a new team? So, I came from the high school actually, where I join a credit recovery, computer class to a middle school. In the, you know, it's one of those things that everybody's really friendly to you, you know? Yeah. Obviously, you're in a team with other people even though I'm kind of a team of one. Nobody else has what I do, I do math because that's my strong suit, but everybody's friendly, like I said, but I didn't really feel anybody kind of put themselves out there and kind of I've been over backwards to make me feel of a more, welcome you not to say that they needed to but I tend to just try to be open with everything. Try to listen and Gage kind of get a feel for what they think of me. And like I said, I don't try to be too pushy. I try to kind of do my own thing for the most part. And why do I think that is just how I've always done things. I've had success Not to say, like I said, I couldn't do something else. Put myself out there more but I feel a little bit vulnerable sometimes and I don't end up messing things up or looking looking like a fool."
628f83dc5398c04bac86f9e6_q5_c1_1671663964_5f775930-11a3-4ec5-a478-dc352722506a,"I want to say one of the biggest things it says same situation with someone. I know you would be my dad allowed his items. My dad is like notorious for only calling when he needs something and so they're worried, they're kind of annoys me and he doesn't do it every time, but more times than not, he actually does. And, you know, I just wish he would actually call just to kind of hang out or just talk in general, and it's not like a honey do list like, hey, can you come over and this and that and I kind of annoys me. And, you know, a lot of times he'll he'll do something for me and As always strings attached and I always have to to wait to see it, what kind of, you know, helping needs for something down the road. So that's kind of annoying to me. And that's a people that are very genuine kind of disenchanted, It kind of annoys me because I'm basically the same person I am at work, as I am at home, you know. I don't try to be somebody else. Think there's just too many fake people out there that are they spend their whole life trying to to be somebody else instead of just trying to find things that they like and themselves and being okay with it. I think that's the reason why there's so many issues with depression and you know, people taking drugs and school shootings is they don't love themselves. So, You know, at the end of the day, the big thing is you just have to be okay with yourself and you're like, all these annoyances, like, even with my own family member, my dad would probably be. Okay? I would probably be, you know, not so hard on him. If I really just trying to cherish cherish, the time that I have with them, my wife actually lost her dad last year. And so, you know, regardless of some time, some of the turmoil that we have with my dad, you know, at the end of the day, he's my dad and I need to just be okay with what he's doing. You know, he's never, he's not getting any younger, so, you know, if he needs a little bit of help, it's okay. Sometimes."

Like I said, I was at the high school and time and I think there's like 1500 kids there and four principles and I had, I think, at least two bosses and one boss, one guy that wasn't my boss would, basically, it was like a third boss. So probably the biggest reason why there's no organization because miscommunication it's like office space for ever seen that or the guy was talking about TPS reports and he has like the same. It's a message from like three different boss of his. Well, it's kind of like that there. You had to hear it from multiple times, this can cause disorganization also mean not being in a team itself, too much can cause some disorganization. So to me, you know, and I'm kind of guilty of that I get a little bit disorganized like I said, that was one of my more glaring weaknesses and you know it's something I need to work on but you know when you're not working eyes like that, you spent half your time trying to find something and you know, you could have a lot of good points, you know, ideas things like that. But if you don't know how to formulate them and you guys things that are kind of standing you what in the way of you and what you're trying to accomplish then. You're going to be basically your lack of organizations, your biggest blockade from getting to where you want and be in being a successful, in your work relationships, things like that."

I think I have good attention to detail being on the subject, whether it might be for work and you know, just making sure I have everything accomplished in time and Well Done. Secondly is my independency to work by myself or I guess with other people being able to provide that structure of Team leadership or team member. And why I think I would fall short on as my weaknesses might be in the same category as communication. I feel that sometimes have a lack of codependency within the team members and trying to figure out what the consensus is between us. I also think that maybe my organization could use some work"

Someone who sees the situations, whether it be a conflict or confusion in a certain area and as someone who'd be able to effectively figure it out and get through it, I also think my friend would describe me as someone who maybe is. Efficient at what they do, whether it be for work, related subjects, family, friends. Any type of commitment to things or they would be good at. I also think the way they would describe me as might be someone, who is efficient at being able to communicate with others, especially family, friends and other members and to how I do things. Yes."

I think that situation would be deciding whether I would go back to school or not. I think that, at the time you have to decide whether choosing education over sacrifice, a little bit of income as worth it. And I decided, then that moment, I should pursue education rather than Hassan schooling. Well, I do know that income is a big part of life nowadays. I also know that education can also Grant you the access to further opportunities and careers.

And honestly more efficiently, some of my downsides would definitely have to be that I have a very strong attention to detail.

Generally, I do that because, you know, It enables me to not only get the question you know, answered get the problem fixed, but it also allows me and others to understand, you know, in the errors that might come up. The process has been done and a better way to document it beyond that though. Also, you know, tend to find that I do this stuff because it helps me feel more confident in myself.

You don't want to actually kind of enter a new surrounding with the new group of people.

And of course the Bradley's ammo as well as its feel to not to mention that the Tools needed to repair it in case something happens, it's extremely difficult to deal with. Now, that's not a typical thing that I normally deal with. That was just kind of pertaining to the fact that I was in the Army and it was doing with the times two situations that I currently He's allowed to have at that moment. And the reason why I don't think it's typical is because now that I've moved out of the army and not in a combined vehicle, commanding people under me, I am more more organized. I generally have several different folders for ease of access to check out frags regulations for my my actual job. And I'm able to keep it concise and easy to locate when I need to be able to find those types of documents that help me and my specific or team at the moment."

And there were, there was one instance where I was confident that somebody I was talking to needed a job or not. I'm sorry, not needed a job needed, a vehicle and I had invited them in and we had a dealer that was that had them approved for A fairly expensive vehicle with a very, very high APR 8. 2016 21 customer didn't have a A good credit score, what I sense that I ended up talking to her and asking this person if she was willing, if she was able to comfortably make those payments and she said no but she really needed a car and so that was when I went to the finance department and spoke with him to see if maybe we could get her approved for a more affordable vehicle for her, that would still be reliable.

I can tend to be a little bit more shy though. I still like to go around and introduce myself and get to know people.

He was technically a supervisor over me. However, he didn't know anything about the job or what the job entailed. He had no history or understanding of the job work whereas I had I did have a working history in the, and he was very, very Forceful in his interactions. With all the other employees, especially me.

Anyway, I when I was dealing with this, I reacted in such a way that to keep us to maybe make it easier for us to be able to get along because we did have to work in a small space together. I would let him know if something. If he was doing something incorrectly but I would do so in a respectful Manner and I would make sure to keep things neutral between us. Although even though he really what he what he was doing and how he managed the rest of the the employees annoyed. Me.

I tend to be very disorganized, but in work, I'm generally tend to be the opposite. I think this is because I understand how I can forget things or lose things easily in my personal life at home, whenever I am disorganized, and the thought of doing that at my My place of work. Absolutely. It just bothers me a lot. I like to know where things are. I like to keep good notes and I like to organize those notes so that I can find it. I just don't want to seem incompetent while I am working and I don't want to put anybody else out at work because everybody has their own things that they have to take care of. And I don't want to have to lean on somebody else in order to do my job properly. So that is that's probably why I keep my workspace very organized."

For instance, when I was younger, some of the most important professional decisions that start the course of a professional life and career. I really never focused on on money as the primary sort of thing to find a career and went for interest alone. And as I got older, however, you know why? I think that is when I was younger, I don't know. That was just my attitude. My personality. I wanted to enjoy what I did and, you know, really money was a second, you know, second thought. However, as I got older within the past sort of ten years and realized that life is, you know, money doesn't bring Happiness.

And also my time as a teacher in the classroom, I learned, you know, Very quickly that sometimes you just have to give things 5 minutes. So my first sort of General reaction to being annoyed. As I first, take a step back and remove myself from the situation and I give it five minutes to marinate in my mind. And think about, you know, sort of opportunities for compromise and approaching thinking, you know, an analysis of is this just A new individual that is annoying. Is it? Someone who I know? Well and I know this is just, you know, a temporary natural, fluctuation of personality and you know logically assess the situation and then you know understanding the individual approach them and very transparent about if something is annoying me and what it could because usually most of the cases in general like something could be annoying indirectly and it's more so like A personal temperament, you know State, you know, when you're in a higher energetic, anxious State, you're more likely to transfer out that energy and very sort of, you know, diminishing way.

But if you know things are being organized and in a certain way or you know, it's like I said that then line has to be met. It says there's going to be, there's going to be some work spaces that aren't so organized. At the moment. But I mean that's not, that's not very typical of me. Like I said that's if need be but usually don't keep things like that because the workspaces and organized, nine out of 10 times, the work is going to be incomplete. Something's going to be missing, it's not going to be done, right? And like I said, if you have a, you have an organize workspace, there's no way that your work is organized."

I'm able to take a task and carry it through on my own without having to rely on other people for constant input or correction. That can also be a weakness at times, if I end up going on the wrong track, sometimes I'm slower to seek Advice or input, then someone else might otherwise be. But as long as I have a firm grounding in the tasks that I'm asked to do, I think that that can definitely be turned into a consistent strength?"

I am a little bit introverted and so it can take me time to get comfortable around. People get to know people really well, but once people know me and I'm able to feel comfortable interacting with them. Those qualities, I feel really start to shine through. I would say if I, if I had to add anything that my now I can't think of anything. Sorry."

I typically will take my time and think through the options, I've had experiences in the past in the business that I own where I've been presented with. For example, an opportunity for an advertising campaign. Pain, which was, you know, more money than I wanted to spend. But I thought, hey, let's take a shot on this. It might bring in a lot more revenue and that ended up being a very poor investment. Did not see much of any return at all and so since then I've become I think a lot more cautious. I really like to be able to think about it to evaluate it. before I make a snap decision and Generally, I like to be, you know, in situations like that. I like to be the one who initiates the change because then I feel more confident that it's what I really want."

Because as I mentioned, previously, I am a little bit. Introverted. That something that I know about myself, I'm comfortable with and I know, Know how to use that to my advantage and to minimize the disadvantages of that. So I feel like my Approach helps me avoid conflict within groups because instead of jumping, right? In by the time, I begin to really participate more intensely. I have a good idea of the The group dynamics, the personalities that are in play and I can, you know, adjust my behavior in my expectations to make sure that I fit within that group."

If I get irritated with someone usually I will just end the conversation. I don't think that it's beneficial to escalate that kind of thing. You know, if it's A customer or someone that I absolutely have to deal with. I try to make the best of the situation and then, you know, when I get together with my wife or my friends later, I might do some venting about that but definitely you know, would not, you know, escalate the irritation. Let the annoyance, get the better of me. I I am able to control my emotional responses, very well."

I would say that probably the only thing that Springs to mind is at my work space here. There's a Supply Closet and that did get a bit disorganized because because I moved office locations and there is a lot of things that didn't get completely unpacked. And so those were in the were in that Supply Closet, they were taking up a lot of space and so it was hard to access the shelves, hard to get things in and out. And so because of that, things ended up just kind of getting, you know, kind of shoved in wherever there was room wherever it was accessible. But I've since cleaned that out, everything is very easily accessible. Everything is organized. You can see where everything is. So like I said, being disorganized is very unusual for me. That's it's not typical at all and you know if there is a part of my workspace or part of my work that's disorganized as soon as I have the time I will. Will generally address that and get it organized."

So I would know to go take care of that. I know that talk to them and get that taken care of. So I can basically make things easier on me and the team.

Well, I believe that I am honest and will rise to the occasion. Whenever needed, certainly in my current work experience, I have had opportunities to show those things. My strengths would probably include ability to listen well and take directions as well as take notes. And My goal would be to not have to ask for the same thing twice, if I'm asking you for help on something, I would hope that I can figure it out that first time with your help and then be able to carry forward on my own going forward. So I am a hard worker. When asked for my input, I don't have trouble speaking up and, and offering it."

I believe I would be described as somebody that is caring and somebody that is willing to help whenever needed and excited about opportunities that I get to offer help and so, my best friend would generally say that I am willing and Also my best friend would probably say that. I don't hold grudges and it is difficult to stay on my bad side. If that would ever ever happened in the first place.

The salary is not as high. As I believe it probably could be. And the reason that I would make that decision as because of the value that I see non monetarily in that current position."

I am, I have embraced the opportunities to get to know new people. And find out as quickly as I can. What strengths and advantages certain members of the team will bring and how I can best interact with with those certain members and equally try to ascertain, the members of the team that may need or Maven desire more. You're leading and be able to help them along as well."

So the my response typically is varies based on the environment. So as an example, if I am in a business meeting and somebody that I have worked with in the past bring something up that I believe is wrong or points out something that I don't believe should be pointed out and I get annoyed that's not the environment where I would act frustrated where I would react much at all and as if as opposed to other situations where it's less Formal I might show my frustration and annoyance, but it's never going to be something that would become an overarching over reaction on my part."

When I am focused on a task, it is, I don't believe it is. Primary importance to clean up the area that in which I'm working by the same token. I don't let it get too bad either. So generally speaking, my workplace, my workspace is is organized, it's probably not picked up all the time. I probably have papers and and whatnot scattered but the the main point is that it, it is that way because I can focus more on the task at hand and at the end of the day, can finish up by cleaning up workspace."

A lot of times in my role as a consultant, I need to come into a company, come into an industry that I have almost no experience of or any prior knowledge. And so it's really just through that Curiosity of meeting with the client asking questions and trying to find out more about their background. Background. That allows me to then provide like value-added solutions to that client that then help their business grow. One of my weaknesses though in that has been, I've struggled in the past with time management and having a broader understanding of operations and to give a more precise example of that. When I was in the US Army, I was a comptroller for a 20,000. Soldier unit and we would at any time be sending a group of 100 people anywhere in the world and so as a finance manager is a budget analyst that was hard to keep track of. And so I created a system that allowed me to then track the movement of all of the Personnel across all the different areas they were. And so that way I was able to overcome that weakness of that situational awareness by Why you just utilizing technology? My background in Excel and operation management."

This also carries over into the job Into My Career frequently where many times I'm presented with unique scenarios or unique situations that require complex Solutions and that's really where I thrive. I mean to give you an example, one of my clients is a video game developer and they were struggling with how to fund this multi-million dollar funding of a video game development and so because I have this like innate desire and or this some innate optimistic Anthem or enthusiasm. It really inspired me to like want to jump in and figure out this problem and create the solution for that client so that they were able to then Figure out. Hey, how are we going to pay for this and It ultimately resulted in the client becoming more successful and finding a cheaper way of raising liquidity to then fund their development. And so yeah, I mean that's probably the best way that my friends would describe me. That enthusiastic optimism. I guess I'm not 30 seconds yet. No, there we go, nevermind."

I make would really benefit me financially or allow me to, you know, I creep additional income from my employer, but a lot of my decisions, usually have Financial impacts on my clients. I mean, like I said, going back to that example of that video game developer because I came in and I provided that solution to them of how To raise liquidity for funding their video, game development. They ultimately were able to profit off of my my decision, my expertise and just my background of understanding Financial modeling and really how to evaluate financial decisions. So yeah, but I mean terms of me the really haven't been too many opportunities for me to really change my Come, or my status."

And a lot of times the, you know, me, Being a new person coming in that team. It's not really the best practice to really just start like off the bat assuming that my systems and processes that I've used at previous roles would really benefit this team because there could be things to learn from that new team. There's I mean it could even be a two-way development where maybe the systems and processes that I've used in the past probably aren't the most efficient versus what they were doing now. And so, really coming into a team with that, like emotional intelligence, allows me to really understand that team, understand their businesses, their processes, and it could even be a learning process, a learning moment, or a learning process for me, as I can, then develop my skill set."

So at a previous role I was a back office financial analyst for a large tech company here in the Colorado area and there was a one of my roles was calculating commissions for our trade team. We had numerous Brokers that basically just moved electronic components and and I didn't get along with this salesman, he he refused to really communicate with me. He refused to answer a lot of emails and so really in situations like that when we both need each other, to really succeed. I mean, this salesperson to depended on me for providing a commission data in order for that salesperson to be paid obviously. And And so, when I recognize that this relationship had issues I said for meeting and I said hey look you know like this is where you're having shortcomings because you're not providing me this information. So how can I really establish like a process or a system with you in order for us to kind of be beneficial? Hey, I need this data by this time and then you can get paid at this time, you know, with that information. And so really, when I Have workplace communication issues or I'm dealing with someone that's annoying me. I just kind of revert to. Hey, what are the problems? How do I create a solution for this? And a lot of times, it's just setting up, you know, maybe a recurring meeting flexing or utilizing the technology that we already have. And using that to really overcome that communication barrier."

But I mean examples of unorganized workplaces. I mean, being in the US Army I it seemed every role I walked into was unorganized. I mean I I can I can cite you know like hey there were times when there was eight of us that need laptops. Yet our unit only had two and so everything had to be verbally, communicated or know things had to be verbally communicated and then just like, written down on paper and that was how information was disseminated from top leadership down. And I mean it's like, hey and then being a budget analyst for You know, those 20,000 Soldier unit. I mean, we had so many different systems for tracking government expenditures, military expenditures that I mean, just to Cobble something together that then pulled from all these different systems into a single spreadsheet to then analyze. And then make a recommendation of like hey here's the spend moving forward. I mean talk about an organized, you know, but really what all of those Experiences and positions really taught me was how to thrive in ambiguous or unorganized environments where hey you just kind of need to be flexible, go with the flow and really think critically of hey, here's the problems that are in front of me. How do I overcome those? And it's really just, hey thinking, critically and developing some system developing some process developing some Rapport, or learning some new skill. To then provide value to that organization."

I like to make schedules and lists and calendars and orders to ensure projects get done when it comes to weaknesses. I think one of my biggest weaknesses is one. Something comes across my desk. I want to get it done immediately and and sometimes that makes it. So I may not want to go through all of the typical channels. You would normally go through in order to get things approved. I don't want to make things take longer than they have to. Some sometimes, I might break through some red tape that I think is unnecessary at times. And I think that can definitely be a weakness because sometimes projects may take longer than a few weeks. Sometimes projects take a few months, and I just need to stay the course and be able to To accept that sometimes projects take a while. Other strings are have, of course, our I really like to research things really, a detail-oriented person. I don't like to generalize things, but those are generally my strengths and weaknesses that I would consider some of my greatest. And some of my weaknesses is that I certainly need to work on."

I take a lot of things, literally, in terms of writing, as well, as I think he would probably describe me as humorous. I like to make a lot of jokes like to have fun in addition though, reliable, if you asked me to be somewhere, if we're going to hang out on somebody who's gonna flake out, he would say I am on the ball. In terms of that. I'm going to show up whenever we scheduled something. I'm not going to cancel at the last minute. That's just not really in my nature of something. So, my calendar. I'm there. I think also generally, they would, they would likely say I am funny, like I said, but I think they all say I'm loyal, you know, I'm always there for them. I'm not going to disappear as a friend. Most of my friends I've had for over 10 years just because I like to keep in contact with people and like to Continue to build relationships, and be comfortable with people.

I can make. One of those decisions is deciding to sit for the CPA exams. My of course had the opportunity to not sit for the for CPA exams. Is it takes a lot of time to study for them and successful and pass all four of them within 18 months, that's allowed. But I thought for one they could, of course, make me more money in the future, as well. As I got a Bonus of the time. If I was able to pass those four, Exams. So that's one one time when I feel like I made the decision to spend you know a ton of time studying I was waking up at 5 a.m. every day before working 12 hours during busy season to get those CPA exams done quickly and I knew it would set me up in the future to make more money even though it was definitely inconvenient in the time. I think usually in those situations I'm a pretty practical person. So I want to, I view it. As I want to make more money in the future because it's going to set me. And my family up for Success going forward. And I think, I think that way it kind of, because of how I was raised. I mean, we didn't have a ton of money Growing Up. So security is something I really value. So I want to set myself up so I am secure in my family secure and so they can feel comfortable as they move forward in life and they don't have to worry about maybe the things I had to worry about when I was growing up myself. So, yeah, I think I'm just really practical about it. I'm fair and I'm just I'm straightforward."

I'm not typically the one who's going to immediately take charge when a new team is built, unless I am, unless I'm already predetermined kind of as the leader of that team. But if I'm coming, I'm coming into the team as an equal member. I'm going to feel out everyone's personality to get an understanding for how people like to be communicated with because I think everyone likes to be communicated with differently. And then from there I'm going to kind of build upon that to grow the team to be more successful. I have more synergies. And I think generally the way I like to do that is because I think communication and how you interact with your team members is the typically the most important part of Of how people how much people enjoy coming to work? Of course, the work itself is important, but you have to enjoy working with your team if you're going to want to come to work each day and if you're going to be willing to really go too bad for everyone on your team and go the extra mile to be successful, you have to be working people. You enjoy doing it with. And I think the only way to build that character of the team, camaraderie of the team is to understand how how everyone their nature and how they like to interact with each other and the best way to interact with each of them"

And typically, when I give instructions on a task, I walk somebody through step-by-step, I try to give them an example, kind of like show them the first example of how to do it and then maybe there's like a hundred more, they have to do or maybe an accounting. It's a reoccurring thing that's done monthly. So the next time they can do it and when I walk them through my expectation, is that they take notes so they can not come with come to me with. As many questions, they can refer back to their notes, if there are items, they have questions on just because I mean, I expect those notes to be really helpful to them. If they have questions, I typically take notes because I don't want to bother my people above me. You know, they're busy, I'm busy. I think the reason it annoys me is just because if you have the opportunity to Take notes and prevent extra work for the people above you and make your work a little bit more efficient. I think it's something you should do because it's going to make you more successful as an employee and as a team member in general to take those notes."

I kind of need everything to be extremely organized. For me to work successfully. My view is kind of like that. Simplified minimalist organization is really important to me, because it allows me to be hyper focused on one thing at a time. And obviously, I can pounce between things. But being organized, just allows that listened to be focused on something, but I would say one of the times my work or work space was not organized was right after unexpectedly, one of my bosses quit, she was a VP of tax over a year ago now. And right after she quit, things became a little hectic and disorganized just because there are so many things coming across my email across my plate that I had never seen before and took me longer than my typical work because I had never done it when I didn't expect that to happen basically but It was not a typical situation, and I think that's because kind of just like I said, I mean, I like things organized because I think it allows me to work at my best when things are organized and set up in a way that is planned. I like things to be planned. I like details. They could just set you up for success in such a team up for Success because they know exactly what's going on."

So that's why I really like to go into different departments and functions and really see how everything works and get like I would say experienced in every aspect that I can have a job, the weakness is itself. That is sometimes it means that I can put on with extra. Possibilities for that. Sometimes I may get like how many step away a bit from my responsibilities in order to tackle on other projects or to learn stuff, but in time I've learned to balance that out and so I can learn other areas. Well, I also do my own job at the maximum effort that I can."

They would also describe me as being very creative has been someone that actually is developed in sort of creative activity, and actually has with some, some experience in it. They would also describe me as being highly responsible, especially when it comes. Is to work-related or any type of task that I have been assigned to. I would also say that they might describe me as As I would say, always calm always having a calm demeanor, trying to stay calm and focused and on task, or just with the eye on the prize for just so that everybody can have somebody to look up to."

As I can, I would say probably, I would spend 75% of my time allowed doing research and in 25, actually, making the decision, I do this because just generating life I found out that it's better to let's say make make a decision. Once you're truly informed, you do actually make things easier like if you actually try to think through it before researching or having the data that you actually need to make such a decision, you're not going to make it, you're just going to lose time. So that's why it's better to just spend a lot of time doing research, as much as you can go as deep as you can and then once you have your mind full of the information that you need, then you tack on the answer."

That way. I don't come off as boastful or somebody that is just talks too much. I like to really like be reserved at first have people come to me and have them asked relevant questions. What they need to know from me, what they want to know, and keep it at them. And I think this is because I like this way of like I would say, I'm more organic approach so that way people get to know you when they when they actually need to get to know you or want to now buy some sort of job responsibilities your some social responsibility. They actually get to know you when they want to anything that just makes everything flow better enough. You that'll sort of robotic."

Calm, keep myself, keep my head from blowing up and it actually works a lot. Normally I am a very calm person and but other than actually getting to the point where I would be annoyed but I actually know how to control that that point. And like go just Countdown. Come back, go back to my regular comfortable, emotional spot, and then I would just go for from there. I think it's like that because it's just method. That's always there for me being a just so sure, school or job related situations. I would never really lost my comment. I think it's thanks to those exercises. And to my general Condon me,"

I mean It isn't it I wouldn't consider it. Something typical of me. It has maybe happened. When I've been like extremely busy, sort of like a worketh on and just, just, like, sprinting to get everything done or just get as much stop done as much as possible. Then you, I would probably end up with a unorganized workspace at the end of the day. But other than that, I don't really have a situation where I would have to be an organized with my workspace. And generally I just have the habit of keeping my workspace organized throughout the day and we're at the end of the day, just taking a bit of time to have everything organized for the next day."

Generally, I am extremely dedicated to any project and of course, to the company itself, I'm always on time. In fact, on time, means being early being on time, to me does not mean arriving at the time. They're supposed to be there. It's arriving 2015, 20, 30 minutes early. Also initiative generally speaking. If I know something needs to be done, I don't have to wait for someone to ask me to do it. I'll go ahead and work on that and get the job done with that Dedication that I mentioned earlier and give my 100% to ensure that the project that I am working on or just in general. Doing things for the company is done, in a way that promotes others to show that same initiative. It's also show that same dedication. Ian."

The passionate part comes in the fact that whatever it is that I get into. I'm really going to give my all to it for an example. I exercise I do bodybuilding so that's one of the things that I dedicate five days a week to go into the gym and I'll spend over an hour, each day doing that. It's a passion is not something. I kind of have do the same thing when it comes to music. I'm a musician. So when it comes to practicing the piano or listening to music and learning new things about music, I'm going to be doing that all the time and put them all into it. Passionate about reading. I love to learn about history. So I'll take the time and read an entire book in one sitting over the course of the day so passionate is definitely something describing also you know as I can all go to see. I do love to learn and it's learning anything it's not just as I mentioned earlier history it's also learning things such as Science. This interesting facts and so forth. So that's the general journal. Help my best friend would describe me."

So typically that's what's going through my head is just that being professional. I'm going to behave also in a way that shows and demonstrates that I have the knowledge and that I have the dedication and motivation as well to do well, because Once again, if it's going to affect myself, I want people to know that they're getting their money's worth that. I'm a valuable asset to whatever company, whatever, Brian, whatever place is deciding to interview me. Or if the decision I'm wanting to make, involves that I want to be sure that it is a valuable decision that I'm giving my all to it. So those would be the things that I would say. How, typically I behave, and that's the reasons why I will behave in that manner."

So it's not about just going up and trying to become friendly with everyone, generally speaking. I like to observe people. I like to listen and see their personalities to see what their likes and dislikes are what gets on their nerves. What annoys them. So that way when I'm interacting with them, I don't create a bad impression. So, you know, for instance, maybe the person doesn't like to talk very Very much and I'll go up to, my guests, are talking to him, that might make them uncomfortable and I feel awkward to them. So, it's kind of noticing, who's in the corner who's very talkative, who likes to speak up a lot who likes to have that choleric personality? So typically for me, I am always kind of observing first and you actually it's because I want to make sure that when I do begin to interact that I interact appropriately and that none of the people there are offended or in any type of weight feel awkward or uncomfortable being around me."

And so if you react in a way that's - that person might be shocked surprised because they assume that what they were doing was not or knowing you, it could be your something as simple. As they're tapping on the desk or something like that. So I think that the best way to do that is to to ignore the situation for the moment and then in the later time, finally pick up a positive way of being able to say something to that person so that they're able to understand that, that is not something that I particularly enjoy typically. I wouldn't use the word annoy. I would try to find some better vocabulary of different connotation that would not make them feel as offended. David."

In other words, things might look all over the place, things are the shoveled from The Observers point of view. However, for me, I know where things are. And the reason why this is for me as far as to this organization or the appearance of this organization is because I'm usually busy working on the things for the place I'm working for, okay? So I don't have time and suspended to do all that cleaning. You get the early in the morning. You start working early in the morning, and then you work in all day. Maybe have a little lunch break and then you have to, you know, leave right afterwards. That's not enough time to be sitting there cleaning up and organizing things all the time, and even if I start organization generally, it's going to become less, and less organized because of the time commitment, but I'm giving to the other It's of my job that I feel like a very important."

I adapt well to new situations. I work really well with teams. I'm very much focused on getting tests done and making sure that I do what's needed to support the team as a whole. Very thorough to extreme high level of concentration, but extremely flexible and very easy to work with and work with a very diverse group now and and almost any job situation of always come away with positive attributes. Positive acknowledgements from my team members, I guess my weakness might be trying to support everyone. All of the same time as I very much, like being in a supportive world."

My best friend, actually refers to me as an old soul and many ways extremely wise She very much love is my ability to remain calm and all the times. She says I have a kind of a reassuring presence that I seem to just exude and make others feel extremely comfortable. So I think I would like to say, calm, somewhat reserved, but generally warm and inclusive and she's often said, I just have a way of making Anyone feel comfortable and feel relaxed, and whatever situation they find themselves. And again, a very kind of supportive role. So I think that's a best description that I can think of and we call my best friend saying about me often. Thank you for the question."

I was working in a very corporate setting a conglomerate of radio stations and I made the very conscious decision to focus on being in a More mission-driven organization, more focused aligned with my personal goals and then making that decision, I left the corporate situation which definitely, I actually took a cut in pay. I still have probably not quite equaled. What I had I stayed in that corporate position. I would probably be definitely at a higher level of pay than I currently am. But after making that decision I am still working after many years in the mission driven organization that I was first drawn to and I behaved in that such an I did made that decision because it was important for me that work had to be more than just about money. It had to be doing something that had purpose and value. And meaning to me, personally, Thank you."

And meeting and interacting with the new team and it seems to, I don't know. Typically, I approach it with comfortable humor and the sense that I find that Humor and laughter can disarm others, and it also makes me feel more comfortable. And so that's how I approach that situation by doing so with Being friendly and some humor, very light humor. Probably a little goofy actually, but I find that it puts me in a comfort level and I think it disarms those and a new team because I believe teamwork, you're working together. I don't step in such a situation where I want to be the center or the spotlight. I want to definitely show how we can cohesively work together. Thank you for that."

Ask myself, is it worth being so annoyed that you say things that you may come across as harsh and that you make right? You may actually regret. So in those situations I try to first take a deep breath, assess, what I'm feeling, and then try to As best, I can't actually explain why I give us a situation. What's annoying? And I, the reason I do that is that I find if you react quickly to something, especially something that's annoying, you don't improve the situation, you can actually exasperate situation."

I think when I'm in the midst of a major project when you get to that kind of metal point where I am have kind of made a breakthrough with whatever that project is, I'm approaching the Finish Line. I do find that my work tends to get quite spread out. Bit on my workspace but that is not that's typical of me more like getting to the Finish Line. Approaching my work, my typical work space actually has to be very organized for me to approach it because that allows me time to kind of think through. Make sure that I have everything need and I have to start out with an organization to successfully complete a task And again, I find once I've gotten kind of deep into it, then you might see some disorder or that, but that is a sign that I am practically halfway there and then approaching the finish line. Thank you."

I want to start out by saying my strengths definitely include time management being able to not fold Under Pressure during hard times or hard tasks and also collaboration as well. I think all three of those are very important when when you're not only at the workplace, but when you're not there as well, I think that to be successful in your environment, you definitely have to have these three things. It's there are three foundational standpoints of being a good employee. In my opinion, definitely the collaboration part. And as far as weaknesses, I would say sometimes. Trying to do too much at once. Would be a weakness learning how to just take things one step at a time, is definitely a weakness that can be improved for sure."

There was a time recently actually in my company where my boss unfortunately had an emergency that he had to deal with. With and somebody needed to step up and and make this decision to lead and knowing that I had enough information and knowledge to get that done. I did I did step up and even though I was anxious about I've never done anything like that.

That's why quickly. I was able to learn my new group of people or my new team of people quickly learn how things are ran in this apartment quickly. Learn the do's and don'ts and also, So you know, make sure that my personality and presence was also being felt as well.

Just don't really care about their job. Unfortunately. And I had that situation happen to me, at my last job, where I kept reminding, this individual to take care of something, It wasn't difficult, really wasn't any critical thinking involved. It was just something that I had to get done and unfortunately the the individual kept brushing it off like it didn't matter. Nothing ended up getting done by the deadline and it was pretty annoying but you know, I dealt with it maturely and another reason that It did annoy me is because if, if I had an employee or let alone, one of my friends, in my group asked me to get something done, I'll make sure that I get it done out of respect for the deadline, and for the person that asked me to do it as well. So, that was definitely a situation that annoyed me."

I would even go as far to say as my department wasn't organized. This was a summer wear. You know, working in a lawn and garden department, obviously there's a high demand for, you know, products what's in stock and it can get pretty pretty chaotic. So you as a person, you gotta do your bus to make sure that you're doing what, you can to keep it organized and You know, go above and beyond for sure. I think if everyone does that helps to limit the disorganization, I would say that it's typical seasonally for this department to become an organized and it's just because of the high demand for the products and you know, there's a lot going on for sure."

You know, typically I I'm always getting checked out at work but what I'm not I'm still doing the right thing and one of my weaknesses.

You know, or a boss said to me at the time. So yeah, that's something that I could say is my weakness. I mean, it's because I care but it's It could still be a weakness in my opinion so yeah.

I don't pots around. I don't get nervous. I jump right in. Like, I'm, I've been a part of the team for years. Why do you think I don't know? I'm outgoing. That's, that's why I don't get nervous in social situations. I actually enjoy interviews, even though this is a virtual one, No, I just got in there and I think it's part of my personality and, you know, I'm really open with people to pretty much immediately. So sometimes to a fault but you know, that's just my personality new team, no big deal, I try to meld right in with whatever, they need employ how whatever I need to do to fit in that won't change my personality per se. But you know what I mean, this to get in there and adopt their culture. Per se to an extent. Yeah, I think it's real important for you. Get a new team and you don't want to be coming in. They're super objectively and coming in and not being able to fix up. You got to understand. They have a team old, a culture. You could you got some of that? It's part of actually being on a team."

So how do I deal with it? I mean I take with a grain of salt I take it to her like if they're having a bad day, I never know, like, how bad of day, they're having. So, even if they say some derogatory stuff, like, hey, you fat, you know, what, or this and that I'm like, thinking, well, I'm probably the only person right now, they can take it out on. I don't know if it's fair me but I die. Roll that off my shoulders. That's just a way to question as why, but, you know, that's just life experience in dealing with these folks, for a long time, you just don't take it serious, some people are drunk, some people are, you know, I'm stressed out. They're going to lash out to whoever it might not be me or might be the next guy, but you know what? I don't let it bother me. I just roll with it and You know that's it. You know you got to like I said, it goes with that whole culture thing. If you know what kind of driver getting into and how folks are dealing with. You got to be prepared to handle that. You know, if you were customer service, you're going to encounter angry people. And you know, people that Y'all are always upset about something, you just have to know what you're getting into. So if you expect it, it makes it a lot easier to handle."

I try to keep it semi-organized, but we have so many things going on in our desk and so much paperwork that those impossible to stay 100% organized. Why is that me? I don't know. It's just been me for since I've been a kid. You, my house isn't super organized. You can't see much behind me, but I mean, it's not dirty, but it's not to worry nice. You can see a coat rack with suits and all kind of other random stuff on there instead of just having coats. I don't know. I react, you know, I'm able to act and perform well in chaos. Embrace the chaos what we say. So yeah, I mean, I could probably adopt some practices That would curtail that a little bit, but it doesn't affect my quality of work. So I don't see, the reason why to do that, I don't need to do that. So I'll continue being the semi scrambled employee. But at the end of the day, I get the job done."

I like to think things through and get things sorted out before I do them. But once I'm on task, I'm working through things until it's done. I would say that could also be a weakness. Though is that I have trouble switching tasks. If situation needs it, I tend to get focused on one thing and do it until I'm done with it. Instead of trying to multitask as much, I find that a little bit difficult. But I think that it works out generally for me because I take that, I take jobs that have more linear task structure rather than bouncing back and forth, usually, but I can make it work. If I need to, it's just not my default state."

Once there was a speech at the end of our graduation, and he mentioned me in it. He said that I was kind and thoughtful and funny, which doesn't really help in a management position. But, you know, I feel like might as well put it out there, you know, he definitely said a lot of things that I agree with, but didn't Really know if other people felt the same way and I appreciated hearing it from him, I consider myself kind whenever I can and I work to be as thoughtful as I can to help other people and generally be a good person if I can.

I tip at least in the past. I've been very risk-averse. I don't want things to go wrong but that has kind of led me to complacency in a lot of situations. So recently, I've been trying to be more bold and determined to do things my own way. Which it's been working out somewhat, it's a new new idea but I hope it'll bring me Good Luck when I, you know, and when I come to this job because I think that being able to decide things and just go for them is something that I strive to do and would be helpful in many work situations."

Sometimes if I have, if I can't really get a good read on how they feel and how they act and everything like that. But with a little bit of time, I can measure the group really well, and we can work together. Great usually depending on the people, I either end up following in helping out, or leading the group and, like, you know, getting everyone to do their part, that's him. Without be how it is in group projects, you know? But when people have more experience than me, I'm as comfortable coming in and helping out, and just getting along. I'm pretty easygoing generally. So I'm not that I'm not that hard to fit into a group, I'd say, but getting truly bonded and, you know, having my own place in the group, takes a little bit of time for me, usually, but when I do it works out good and I have A lot of a lot of good friends that way."

I think that's due to how I was raised. I was generally someone who wanted to be well-liked, you could say, and most grown-ups in my life preferred, someone who is obedient and you know, more passive. I've been working on lately being more firm about boundaries and being more, you know, shared of about why things annoy me. But generally, I'm able to weather the storm. He could say if an annoying customer or something comes up, it doesn't really bother me that much. That's only when I have prolonged exposure, prolonged exposure to like an annoying roommate or friend or something, when I would speak up and tell them how I'm feeling, but I'm usually gentle about it then too, because I don't want to upset anyone if I can avoid it, you know? But I think I generally try to be, you know, as gentle as I can about getting my feelings across And you know, do my best to make things better for both of us."

Well, I would say I generally keep things tidy like I don't leave food or Garbage around or anything like that but papers and books and up, not really put away where they should be. Sometimes just a bit of a mess, you know, in that sense. But everything is, you know, clean and workable. I can use, I leave enough space to work and get everything done that. I need to. It just ends up being a little bit of a lower priority than say, doing a project for You know, client or for working on things that I enjoy doing as a hobby just kind of ends up below those because it's cleaning, you know, it's not really fun.

Ethic strong work ethic. I like to really get in there and get the job done. I think a lot of people would say that when you work with me, I can be a very demanding boss but I'm fair. I get in there and work with my people and really just attempt to keep everything moving along as quickly as possible. I think that's very important. I think people look for with a leader and somebody that you're working with is that they're working with you side by side and not necessarily dictating everything that's going on versus, you know, more collaborative approach versus a top-down approach. So I think that's very, very important. In terms of weakness, probably, one of my biggest weaknesses would be as a generally don't like doing a lot of training with people. This is not one of my strong point. That's not something that I like to do. I can do it, but I would not consider a strength. It's more of a weakness and just general training of employed people,"

If I say I'm going to do something for somebody or I'm going to be somewhere that will happen. I don't I don't shirk my responsibilities or look lightly on items or things that I've done or said to help people out with. So think most of my friends would say very dependable, Oil. Good person. Good heart willing to help out under pretty much any circumstance. Compare, the very sociable like, to be around people like, to talk, like to have fun, but it's time to get down to business to, there's no fooling around there, so, yeah."

I'm not all that concerned about my status. I think it's important again, as a leader, or someone that is in a leadership position. The status is already there you shouldn't be thinking about. How can I constantly improve that if you do the job, you say and do what you say you're going to do that status is going to be there. So it's not something that I really think about. And then in terms of money I think it's important to always can have that in the back, your mind. How does that affect your status or employment and your financial? At ease. And also, I would look at how does the decision I make affect those around me as well. So a lot of times I think sometimes people just look so closely at me, me me, I have this is all about me. This is my money. I need to make more how to your actions. Also affect those around, you both your peers and subordinates in terms of their ability to make money, get a raise move up in the company. So again, I kind of look at that more collaborative and kind of status for all Pay for all type situations."

What interests them at work, what they like, what they don't like. It's almost like doing what we're doing right here, job interview, trying to find out what these people are all about. What their likes dislikes, are where they see themselves where they I see the company going. And again because I think it's a good start to know your team on more than just a work, level know them as people. Because that outside influences though, you try and keep them out of work, those type of things can really pop in and out quickly and can change that work environment. So I think it's really important to get to know the person get to know what they like, what they dislike their work habits and then that just helps you deal with them. As you move through a project, you'll be able to handle the situations that may arise because of their work style their personality Their home life and it just makes for an easier. Easier job easier task."

You were annoyed you for some reason. And I think probably the best thing that you can do in that I tend to do is listen to the person because maybe they're trying in maybe they don't know quite how to tell you what's bothering them or what's on their mind. So listen to what they're saying, even though it's annoying, even though it might be kind of Bugging you. Listen to what they're saying because there may be a message in there that some importance I think that's important that you do that because if you don't you might miss some important movement and movement but some important information that they're trying to give to you so annoying. People annoying situations, you have to deal with them. And sometimes if they keep going, you may need to cut them short. He's got what you need. Unity think, you know what's going on, but give them a new that person the opportunity to express what they're trying to say because it may be something important once you think you've got the gist of it, then you can kind of cut it off and move on to the next thing."

But if you can't look behind, you can see there's another desk behind me and it's not cluttered just has a few rocks on there that I like to collect on. If I were to scan the camera around you to the rest of the work space is fairly well, organized. I probably would spend a little bit of time. If I walked into a space that was not organized the way I like exactly. I would spend a little bit of time, kind of straightening stuff out looking looking at where stuff is getting to know the space and seeing. If there aren't words some ways to maybe move stuff around to make it a little more productive or a little bit easier to Get in the only time I work space really gets disorganized is there's a lot of emails where you're printing a lot of stuff up. A lot of mail, a lot of memos and things that are coming from the corporate offices. I tend to let them kind of just pile up in one spot and I'll go through them on occasion. So I think really the only time that the inauguration happens is when there's just a lot of other things. Other paper coming into the office that need to be cleaned up. And I'll usually once a week kind of Go through that and get stuff cleaned up. I don't like to have a lot of clutter around."

Well, basically I listen well, to what the customer has to say, find out what their need is. I find out what I need to do to be able to take care of the problem. Look, up the necessary materials, verify who they are. So there's not any type of security breach. CH and then I patiently go through each style that they have or the problems that they have and adjust to their personality style to speak fast if they speak slow. If their intermediate beginner Advanced person and worked with them accordingly, that is what basically weakness would be if People yelling, screaming demanding things that they're just not going to get and they wanting to do things that I can't do anything. It's not really a weakness. It's just things that I cannot. For tray or give to them. And that's a week this cuz I have no way of getting out of it."

Generally very well is giving and will help and do what he needs to do to try to resolve any type of issue loyal to that person. If long as they're loyal to me, I will be loyal to them and I will help them any way I can. I'm a good listener. I will help listening to them.

It's made by somebody else. And in which, in my case, that is what happened. If I was working a full-time 40-hour, a week job and due to external circumstances that was beyond my control. I ended up getting terminated from that job because of attendance. So, when that occurs when you're making such and such amount of money and then you're counting on that money, but yet you end up getting terminated that changes your whole situation and how much you make and then you scramble and you try to get other situations and other jobs and unemployment and such and There was a ton of complications with getting unemployment and I had a go through a bunch of medical tests and also to get applied to do one job, that was a caretaker type position. It wasn't even close to the amount of the same money that I made before. But again, external situations is something that I had to do and I had really no choice but to do it. So that's how that can change."

People it can be if you're going to a class and you're going to be meeting in with a whole bunch of new students, like yourself. And you may not know anybody there. So you're starting off fresh, you have to make a good first impression. Look pretty much everyone that's there and if you fail to do that and you're having an off day, well, that It depend at how well you're going to be perceived throughout the rest of that particular class and yes or no. Does it really make a difference? It depends on that particular person. And that our situation could be, if you are starting a new position or job and you got to be meeting new management colleagues and employees that you're going to be working with in the same type of situation. Either going to give Give a good impression or you're not and some people are leaders and they might jump right in and be able to pick right up in at the group and be part of it and others are followers and they're going to kind of hang out in the back and then learn what they can. And eventually some people will talk to you and then you'll start to other You know, Jonathan and learn new people."

She annoyed me 24/7. It was actually good to go to work because then I wouldn't be annoyed at her. At least I could be annoyed as somebody else. If they rub me the wrong way, a lot of times I would stay at work and just work a little extra overtime so I wouldn't have to go home to be annoyed but then when I stuck got stuck working at home. Home. Then it was the fun part was trying to keep her out from my work area because she would come in and do stupid stuff and just annoy the crap out of me. So yeah, there's there's one way, you know, the someone could annoy you, they can say, things they can make noise in the background, they can poke you, they can throw things at you and Say things, some people like to annoy you and they get the biggest kick out of it and the biggest charge out of it.

But then things happen, you know, you gained something extra here and something extra there or somebody gives you something that needs to be put away. Or you put something there that like, oh yeah, I got to put that away and eventually you start collecting all kinds of different things on the table that you're Workspace. It was just designed for you to do your work and your job and and then you're not going all kinds of things over trying to maneuver around a bunch of stuff and until you finally get tired of it and then you go and clean and you put all that stuff and then you start back over why do you think that happens? Is a lot of times you just put things off to the side you procrastinate you want to deal with it later because you have more important things to do at the time. And eventually on a day off or something, you go through and you try to fix that issue."

I would say, I behaved comfortable and even-keeled. I try. I said, I try to separate the financial ramifications generally, I try to just be a beep level-headed. You know, due to the ramifications that could potentially have an impact on people's mental status, how to approach these things. So I try to stay level-headed separate the financial ramifications from the whole thing. So I can make the best decisions. And why do I think that is? So one thing that I pride myself in is, you know, generally, I'm very financially responsible. I save my money. You know, typically, I live within my means, I don't live paycheck to paycheck, so I have money saved up you No, I apply. You know, the Work World. I'm operate from a position of strength. I'm not living paycheck to paycheck. So, you know, things don't go my way.

So when I join a new team of people, I tend to be friendly and open, but I also try to listen more and observe not going to be shy and passive, you know, I'm definitely gonna let my presence be known. Let it be known that I'm there and I exist. I'm a part of this team. Now, I'm gonna make sure of that, but I'm also going to observe, and listen, and kind of see how people are doing things before I try to just come in, you know, Make it a bunch of, you know, say an input. I'm going to observe and listen first while being friendly and why I think that is is, you know, just from a leadership perspective from over from a leadership perspective, you don't want to just overwhelm people. You don't want to be overbearing, you don't want to come in acting like mr. Know-it-all yeah, you may have a lot of value in substance to offer the team. You may have a lot of useful information on for the team, but going in there like hey my mr. Hotshot right from the jump without seeing how they do things and I listen to how they do things and seeing how to culture of the team as before For implementing those things. I don't think it's a recipe for Success.

And, you know, one thing I've learned is you got to be up front, you know, you can't be a pushover in those situations. I'm not saying you got to be in a hole and just be disrespectful and rude about it. But you know, I usually react this. I let them know what they're doing and how they're annoying me and you know, I why I don't appreciate it, how I don't appreciate that and, you know, you can be polite, but also firm in these situations and that's kind of how I react, I have no problem being up front about what's bothering me. What's annoying me, why it's annoying me? And why I think that is, is, you know, there's a lot of people who just let stuff slide, Let it go, Let it go, Let the annoyances go and then it all boils up, and they react poorly, are they handled things poorly? It carries over to how they do their daily tasks. I don't want that. So, you know, if something is annoying me, somethings irritate me, I set boundaries and I think that's just a sign of being headstrong and, you know, valuing myself as a person. So I hope that Sir, is that thoroughly?"

May be lots of high turnover and stuff like that but generally I tend to not ask generally that's pretty untypical at me typically, I'm very organized and very clean. I mean I tend to be very organized. So it's very rare that my personal workspace is not organized and why I think that is I pride myself. In half I pride myself and how I go about everything. Be it from top to bottom, you know, I want a comfortable work space where I'm going to be at you know be a work from home, work on site whatever and I'm gonna be there five days a week. Six days a week 40 plus hours a week. I want a comfortable work station, I want a comfortable environment. So, you know, I can control my work situation. Most of you I've had good, mostly I've had a lot of comfortable work spaces because I try to push for that and, you know, I work with people who push for that. So, you know, that's unorganized workspaces is kind of rare.

But being successful also requires you to be able to demonstrate and communicate how that Talent said AIDS their company and their ability to compete well in the marketplace. But I think likewise one of my main weaknesses is perhaps the occasional desire to over focus. On the customer service aspect of a particular sale, or a particular communication, and sometimes, let the let the technical know-how and intellectual creativity exists as a secondary, aim to the overall benefit of of Interfacing with the customer and really effective way."

I go to Great Lengths, to get the things that I want and Pace a great deal of focus on the things in my life. That is highest for the any family, my education, my hobbies. But I think if he's being honest, would also probably say that sometimes those things negatively impact certain other parts of my life, where maybe I'm too driven towards a certain thing and let other things. I don't find out as particularly important go by the wayside. So I think it's important overall to make sure that in the context of having a particular goal. Oh, that you're also making the other efforts to focus on the other things in your life that you should find truly important."

It's incredibly difficult to overcome this natural inclinations towards status, and for me especially money more 7 status when engaging in a particular, professional decision. So I recently had a circumstance where I could have made a decision that would have harmed, one of our clients, but brought about a great deal of benefit. To the firm until you personally financially. And I was really pressed it making this decision towards essentially screwing over one of our clients for the benefit and this is not like this, not my current job, this is a previous job. I was really, I was really pushed to exact, and I think my internal indecision combined with You know, the overall position of like fur and that it would have been totally fine to do that. When I when I ended up making the decision I did to not engage in that activity. I think there were a couple feeling some of you. No shame for even thinking about that guilt but I think also kind of discussed with the people around me that even you know people who wouldn't directly benefited were like yeah, do that, that's a good idea. Not even being pushed by selfless interest but just like it overall willingness to do. harm to others for your own benefit and I think it's a tough situation, but in the definitely like ways in the conscience and on Haha, no one one conception of oneself."

Joining a new team that is trying to accomplish a goal and being able to lend my strengths and expertise towards the accomplishment of whatever particular goal is occurring in a given situation. I think that oftentimes people display, a great deal of nervousness and hesitation towards that but I think overall like putting your best foot forward being really open and interested in the occurrences in case there were another person really presented a unique opportunity. Unity in a really just like engaging situation to be able to display and refine your talents but it grow and develop them in just new context, which is, you know, extremely useful and practical in addition to just being overall a fun time."

I think a part of this job is being, you know kind of stolid very like still emotional. In the face of of certain troubles that you know, naturally come along with the position. But I think there are definitely been some circumstances where a person's perhaps got to me in terms of annoyance. But I think the best thing is always always in these situations, it's just like you know, it sounds really cliche cliche but just open communication. I think saws, so many of these issues very rarely are individuals out you know, to harm you or two around. These feelings in India, especially when it's not like a competitive situation. Like Harley, does anyone just feel the inclination to annoy someone else in the workplace or step on someone's Toes or just put anyone in a negative emotional stance? So I think just being open about like, hey, you know, that thing was usually for me, it's something harmful. So, hey, you know, I didn't think that that was really beneficial for us the deal. I didn't know why. You, I don't know what you did that. That unnecessarily spend our time scale now, We don't know if we're to make deadlines like just being really open about like, hey, we just want to be on the same page about what our goals are in the ways that we that we, you know, seek to achieve them. So I think I think just by being open, being really honest being really straightforward. You can kind of overcome a lot of these particular situations."

To some previous circumstances, I've been in a previous job where I I was an associate. There were several issues associated with the organization of the workplace, not in the smallest, you know, in proper timing, having a dividuals coming the same time for the same role. Understaffing overstaffing inability to assist clients because of a lack of information, communicated inability to assist clients because of a lack of resources. Allocated, you know, that there were this job just a great number of issues. And I think they're kind of instilled in me, the a real opposition to just disorganize workplaces. And I think for that reason, these are not situations that are really typical of me. I feel like I do my absolute best to avoid getting myself, any co-workers, any, you know, subordinates, any bosses are supervisors of involved in any situation that they feel like there's a lack of organization and they're not able to see quite clearly, what the circumstance that were involved in, is in ways to move us towards a better situation. So I think, you know, what are the most important parts of being in a workplace? No matter your position. Just Making sure you have a great deal of organization because without having that Clarity and focus your unable to figure out how to chart a path towards, whatever the goal or aim of a given situation is."

I Think that when it comes to working with subordinates of especially people who are following you, they don't really care about following you. Unless they know how much you care about them.

I taught Middle School 7th grade, specifically English language arts I it was just that one school year 1920 and I butted heads with both with the administration of the school with parents and with parents and two, to a lesser extent, I guess rather than both also the students It was difficult for me to connect to the class overall. This led to Very bad mental health to the extent that I genuinely considered killing myself. And I think in situations where I have to make a decision that would affect my status or how much money I make.

To maintain if I, I don't like conflict and so I'm not going to enter conflict. Unless it's a relationship that I care about, one of my co-workers, at my current job over shares a lot. And I Not that, that I want anything bad to happen to her family, but I don't need to hear all about what your grandchildren got up to this last weekend and I find that really annoying. But that's not a relationship that I really care about. And so I just ignore it. You know, I do need to keep at least a professional working relationship and so I'm not rude. I just either don't say something or say, the bare minimum to not have this person dislike me. When it is a person that I care about in that, I want to keep a relationship with, I'll let them know.

If it's a particular project or anything that's being asked about the making sure that we're all grabbing each other's insight to kind of, you know, put the old vad is together into one bucket. And then, of course, filtering out exactly what is what is the best possible scenario for all. Combined. The why do I think that is? I mean I believe that I behaved this way because I've worked around teams for over 12 to 14 years of my life. And I've come to learn that. You know this method is generally very safe and effective method to definitely come in and make sure that you're not too quiet. You got to make sure you're getting the level of eye contact. You giving attention to everyone, letting everyone have a chance to speak and I'm sure that the table is comfortable around each other. And, you know, if it's a group of five people group of 10, people got to make sure everyone's in it. You got to make sure everyone's involved.

If they're, you know, either running late or they're not completing all of their daily tasks or the being very quiet or distant mean, while you're working in an industry where it requires the complete opposite, where you have to be engaging, you have to be a client Center. A person if you're not coming in and doing what is being asked, even after having multiple conversations about it, in terms of trying to find the root cause and how can we get you back on the right path that can? That can, of course, annoy me because, you know, when there's a temps that are being made in order to correct a specific behavior and those behaviors are not being corrected, it can come off as annoying, it can come off as a We're okay. This is not working so you're just wasting your own time of sitting down with the person having a one-on-one conversation, creating a solution asking if they need any help in order to achieve it being there as a support and being as a role model and they're just not you know, they're not complying. So yes that can that can come off as annoying and, you know, for myself, you know it's kind of like a three-strike rule Ali. It's like speak to you once speak to you twice. But after two times and, you know, a third time is kind of like the final straw, really. And most of these scenarios they it doesn't require such hard work or it's not difficult to correct the opportunity. And the reason why I would react in that way is because, you know, we have a, I work in the line of business where you need to make sure, That you show up every single day. So if you're coming in and you're not, you know, delivering on that specific day. Then it's time to it's being wasted production, being wasted money that is not being earned and it impacts it doesn't just impact that person individually. Impacts everybody."

And earlier question, I like to research So I do that in even in like, social situations. I do my research, I look around and I notice what the different personality types are the different motivations and things like that. I just think it's some, it gives you an advantage and it's beneficial for you because you're making informed decisions and not Just reacting to situations."

See the situation from different perspectives so that I don't just react and regret. So yeah, I will prefer to step back from the emotional impact and just kind of pay attention. See, you know what's motivating? This, what do they want? What are they trying to get at? Is it a miscommunication? Because sometimes I'm wrong and I get annoyed. Also something that I'm perceiving that's not necessarily what Happening. So yeah, it's it goes back to me being observed and I kind of step back. Just calm myself, down and take a moment to look at the situation because a lot of times we can blow situations out of proportion, just from being sleepy or hungry annoyed. Whatever it is, you have all type of chemical reactions that fluctuate with your body. So I just try not to escalate a situation if I'm being annoying die. Especially at work try to take myself out of the situation if my ego out of this situation so that I'm able to address it in a productive way because sometimes just having a congress Ponce is enough to help someone calm down, you know? So that's how I've been through."

Because I, like I said, I get bored easily, so, sometimes I hadn't had a habit of multitasking of doing different things. It's like, okay, this project and it's going to take a while, so I'll get some of this done. But I also get this started. And also get this started which works sometimes like for good line. If you're getting closer to having something that needs to be turned in or, you know, you have to divide your time between different things, it's fine in moderation, but this is something that I hadn't learned to stop multitasking. He tasks me because that's what leads to clutter for me. I had to learn to do something and finish it. So for me, if my workspace was not very organized, it's because I didn't finish. I think the Clutter is just me putting something off. If I have papers and like, we'll get to those later. They pile up because I didn't get to those when I, when I have them in my hand, I didn't make time for them. So I think just not delaying taking care of whatever, paperwork or whatever. I have going on and that moment really doesn't give an opportunity to pile up, so that's something I had to learn for myself. Stop multitasking and stop procrastinating. Don't put it off until it now because typically it takes to less than 2 to 3 less than 5 minutes. So that was a good question."

Not just to my managers were bosses but my co-workers as well. and well, I I tend to be very responsible. So those are my strengths, my weaknesses. It might be that That sometimes when there's a lot of work, I get too stressed and it becomes difficult for me to finish a task. I might be a little slower than I should be."

62ceba5fdab49dfc90278cbb_q3_c1_1671568623_b84fb89b-6c55-4736-a483-78780fdb7316,"so in the past I have had to do or I've had to make decisions that could affect my status or even bonuses that I could get, but it was because I just wanted what was best for the costumer and the way I usually behave is that I focus on the customer and to make sure that I'm following the rules of the company. So if it costed me money, it should have, it should only be personal money. Like if I am going to get a bonus of some sort, and I think that is because I care for the customer and just doing a good job and I also care about the company that I'm working for I think that would be the reason why."
62ceba5fdab49dfc90278cbb_q4_c1_1671568774_b84fb89b-6c55-4736-a483-78780fdb7316,"So when I join new teams, it's because I have either changed jobs or my position has changed where I'm working at the way that I usually behave is first. I'm a little shy. I'm not going to talk that much and I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to also meet my co-workers like the way that they are, how they behave with someone new, how they can be helpful. So I'm just going to be shy but also I'm gonna the reason why I'm going to be quiet is because I'm gonna be studying people's behaviors around me. That way. I know how they probably would usually work. And I think that this is just kind of protecting myself. because you don't know how people can be in jobs and especially if Personally, I like to work in teams but if people are not going to be helpful, I'm not gonna like it. So I'm just going to be studying, everybody's behavior and know who I would like to work with or if I have to work with someone that I don't like then how could I behave? Better to achieve better? Goals or to just achieve the goals that we have."

So it was just our shift we would, it was only the two of us. so, not annoyed me because even though we didn't have a lot of work to do at that time in the morning, it felt in responsible on their part. I didn't say anything at first because I was fairly new, and I didn't want to get in trouble. This person was not new, and she had been working there for quite a while. I think that this is because I was just avoiding conflict, but then I started to see who I could talk to about this. Only to find out that I couldn't because my boss basically had my coworker under his wing so it would have been bad for me and I think I was just trying to look out for myself."
62ceba5fdab49dfc90278cbb_q6_c1_1671568957_b84fb89b-6c55-4736-a483-78780fdb7316,"Well, it's not. It's mostly always organized now. I think that there's only a couple of days when it's not and it's not very typical and I think it's because of the way we communicate and the way that we can hold the team, there's only three of us now. So we communicate the best we can. No, I think. Personally, I don't think I would like to say anything else. I just think that currently my team is good and we are always trying to communicate. So my workspace is very organized, it's just it's typically organized."

Okay, sorry about that. Yeah, I'm pretty independent. I could figure out problems and fix them pretty well on my own. I'm a good team player, I work well with others. I like to work with other people and get advice from them and also give them advice and in a friendly way like critique each other and just make it, make sure that we're doing a good job and we're being better than like what were expected and just just making progress and some of my weaknesses would be B, I would say that I'm independent. So I kind of have a hard time With like Authority. I'd say it's not really a thority cuz I work with everybody but it's just I have that in me to where I just want to be that person that's like a kind of knows everything that not like a know-it-all but just that's always good at what has to be done or what is expected of me."

I'm really open minded open to pretty much to trying anything. Whether it's food activities or just anything. Watching movie. Listen to music. I'm very open-minded. I'm open to anything the world has to offer. Another one is just very. Carrying. And I can't think of the word. Just being able to relate to other people and how they're feeling and things that they're going through. I could sense how other people are feeling really good and I could just feel when something's wrong with them, like, emotionally or just if they're bothered or just if something's off them. I could just I could sense. It really good and I just have that That instinct."
62d06d1b651d6922f62fab9b_q3_c1_1673290088_d92a2df1-9954-4066-a60d-925261d4e694,"Yeah, yeah. So the most recent example for this For how I act in situations that affect how much money I make or semi-professional. My job is the last job that I had was construction job and I was I didn't know anybody going in the guys that know me, they know. I had a little bit of experience more than the other guys, currently that would work in there. So the boss after a couple days of work in there and seeing how I did boss approached me and said that he liked, I work and my personality. Stuff like that and just said I was a really good worker and said that there's room for me to work my way up in the company. And here to give me the chance to work next to him learning how to operate heavy machinery, and just how to do more complicated things and being above the jobs that the other workers that they were doing that he had currently hired there. So So I just pretty much behave just professionally and I listened more than what I talk. I just take everything in because I like to observe everything and I don't really like to put too much. I like to take it all in whether it's just information or just regular words conversation, I just like to take in more than what I give out."
62d06d1b651d6922f62fab9b_q4_c1_1673290181_d92a2df1-9954-4066-a60d-925261d4e694,"Yeah, so whenever I join the team of new people that I've never met before, I'm real friendly and real open really straightforward. I like to introduce myself, I shake their hands. Get to know them a little bit, just their names, just make small talk, you know, get to know them just on a friendly level, just being that we're going to work together and see each other every day for most of the day. I like to be on the same page as everybody else. So I like to make sure everybody is filling the same, you know, in a good mood, ready to work together, ready to get the job done and just Come on, do some problem solving if anything comes up. You know, just being that we don't know each other and everybody's new. We don't really know how we feel or how we're going to react in certain situations, so it's always good to just keep an open mind and just be aware of how things are going. And what what I'm saying and how I can make people feel"
62d06d1b651d6922f62fab9b_q5_c1_1673290265_d92a2df1-9954-4066-a60d-925261d4e694,"Yeah. So usually when somebody annoys me I don't really get too bothered. I like to take my time and just take a deep breath, you know, just let it pass and just tell myself, you know, I feel like this for this couple seconds or a couple minutes, whatever it is but it'll pass whatever is going on with whoever it is There's always going to be time to in the future to make it better. Figure it out, or just. But for me, I don't really like to let it go that far. So I don't. I'm the type of person that's, I don't really like too much conflict, but like I said before, I'm straightforward. So, I'll just a situation, but I'll just sit correctly and in a way that where it's going to get taken care of in a professional manner, whether it's whether I'm in the workplace or just At the store or wherever it is at home, or just with regular people."
62d06d1b651d6922f62fab9b_q6_c1_1673290354_d92a2df1-9954-4066-a60d-925261d4e694,"Yeah. So for my workspace and for even just my house or just places where I'm at in general for it to be not very organized and dysfunctional messy. It's not very typical of me. I like to keep everything clean and knee. I don't like anything. To be out of place if it's trash, or if it's like a water bottle, anything small to even like the pillows on the couches, if they're turned wrong, I'm really picky about how things are and how things are set up. And I think I'm like that because the jobs that I've had, I've had to have an eye for detail. I'd have to make sure if something was perfectly cleaned or done correctly. So I just have that eye in that mentality, that everything has to be correct and in the right spot and just done as good as it could be. In pretty much almost perfect as it can."

I have a strong sense of creativity and coming up with some really great ideas and people are usually very receptive to what I can offer, what I can bring to the table and people always feel comfortable. Edible with me, because typically, as I said, very positive in my communications with people. So I tend to be that way and people feel very comfortable with me. I feel that one of my weaknesses is that. Unfortunately, I am not bilingual and that is something that I would like to work on and Very willing to and capable of learning and moving forward with that. I feel that that would very much help with all the diversity in my area at this time, another strength I have is confidence and confident in my ideas"

Enjoy about me and something that they truly compliment me."

And what I do is simply my best. I'd be myself. I enhance the qualities that I have. That would qualify me for the job. And I For lack of better term fight fair. I'm not the type of person that would be unfair and, you know, use things to my advantage not in a good more leeway. I tend to be honest and if I'm not the right one, for the position, just being who I am and using my own values to my advantage, then I'm not going to cheat my way above somebody else. It's just not who I am. Typically I do things the right way, and that's who I am. And that's who I always will be."

The reason that I'm I'm the new person here and I want to listen to them generally. I would listen to see how they run things in their team. Obviously, I'm again I'm the new person coming in and so without stepping on any toes, I want them to know that I'm ready to hit the ground running and confident and would love to be part of the team in that my ideas are no better than anybody else's and vice versa. And that's why we work as a team. So, yeah, generally like I said, I like to listen first, And just just to show them that I'm very interested in how they work as a team so that I can incorporate myself and my strengths."

And of course, there's been several times where internal and external customers have been somewhat difficult to deal with. I do Retain my patients, I try to step back, take a breath before reacting to their behavior and be a little bit understanding rather than reacting in a, in a defensive or negative manner. Yes, I would definitely step back and try to look at things a little bit more from their perspective. If I can can regardless, I tend to once again, stay as positive of, I can generally defusing the flame on their end and just, like I said, taking a deep breath and and just stepping back for just a moment and getting my thoughts together before Reacting in any type of negative manner."

If for some reason, there was a day where lots of people came in and just kind of toss things in my workspace, or maybe somebody used my workspace when I was away from it and I did come back to say, an unorganized workspace. I would I'm very good at cleaning that kind of thing up, meaning organizing. And because typically I would have a very organized system I love folders and bins and labels and yeah. Like I said, I tend to keep things very organized as a rule, that's just who I am. It makes the work much more efficient. And so, I would. Absolutely take a moment to sort through things and get them in an organized efficient way, so that, I can go ahead and move forward. I feel that lots of disorganization may cause a little bit of not stress, but just Doesn't put someone in a good mindset for the day."

So strengths I would say generally people say that I'm very well-spoken despite that little blip than the brother well-spoken. I communicate well with individuals a very positive. I bring a good good positive relationship to the teams that Armand. Weaknesses, I would say that. In general, even though it's hard to ever talk about your weaknesses, sometimes I need sometimes don't ask enough for specific guidance for a task. So sometimes I will get a general idea and I end up doing a task in the way that I am a, pretended to be done, but it's really there. Whoever assign the task or whoever the overall scope of the task is not exactly what I had. Envisioned and so there's sort of a disconnect there and then I have to work with whoever is where assign the task to meet somewhere in the middle or to just go over all the way over to their side, really. If there's no there's no joint Vision there."

Funny I think he would describe me as someone that was is willing to help out no matter what, the what the occasion, always willing to go above and beyond for my friends and family. They would say that I am fun. That I am always up to try something new. Yeah, that pretty much describes it that I'm fine. I mean, those are all great characteristic so we think of it any bad characteristics. They were decided me. Probably not. Maybe that I make fun of them too much but you know, how that is with friends. Yeah, that was a basically sums it up."

And I would say that generally, I just talked about myself, of course, overly positively. I'm never going to especially when money is on the line here. You're never saying well, oh, I could have done this better. I could have done this better use talking about the things that you did do what limited you. Why you didn't, if you didn't get everything done, that you were expected to do or that you hope to do, why that occurred. But then hopefully have something to offset that what you didn't do with what you did do and usually that's always been. Been fairly easy for me to describe just a bit, a very professionally and talked about in a very concise matter. How you are benefiting the company."

Generally I want to go to a good assessment of how the team operates how they interact with each other. I don't want to start talking about things that I don't really have a good scope on that. The team has been working on or that they have more general knowledge in me than me in there. Yeah, I generally I take I take an observational type of approach. I think it's better to do that in the beginning. Once you start to get some information sort of ask more questions, it's always good to ask general questions, but then to really drill down. Once you start to get more information and then you can start to contribute your own opinions and thoughts."

There's personal situations like my brother who, of course, annoyed me like anyone who has a brother knows that's how it is growing up, right? But in the office and a professional work environment, someone is annoying. I tried to let anything get personal. If there's a disagreement on on work, in a different way to talk about, maybe different viewpoints, then I will generally express my viewpoints. If they're being annoying, I have a pretty high tolerance for being annoyed, and if it gets too bad, you call it a third party, calling the manager call in another colleague. To sort of be the Arbiter. I've never had in a personal issue with someone, I'm working with where they are, just annoying me to an extent that it is detrimental to work. If that happened, I would probably just report it to HR. If that was the last result Resort."

So it's the problem sort of fixes itself in that aspect, I have, you know, maybe around College age, I was a little Messier. But once I started to organize myself better, it was never really an issue and and I became much more productive. so yeah, the typically, if things are an organized organized them, Sure. I can't would you tell us more? I would just say that the more cluttered desk is the more your mind wanders, the more you try to avoid, the more you try to avoid cleaning up the mess, it's sort of a self-perpetuating issue if you areIf you're not organized, you'll get more unorganized. If you're organized your work to stay. Organized is the way I think about it, it's sort of like if you have a clean room you were you see, you like it, you see that? It looks nice. You try to maintain how it looks sort of just becomes a mindset."

I usually take quite a bit of time to think these decisions out and make a list of pros and cons and then go into the situation very carefully. I also consult other people to get their advice on what they think I should do. And I attempt to reinforce my own opinion but get other perspectives that I might not have seen before. My status and how much money I make is only important to me in that, I maintain my lifestyle. It's not important in that, I increase it quickly."

Like I want to make sure I'm making the best choice or offers and sometimes there's not time to do that. It can be a time stealer and energies dealer and sometimes I can get in the way because sometimes you have to implement a solution that is less than perfect and from that know that you will celebrate progress over.

So I tend to go in and observe share enough to keep them interested in my what I have to contribute. To the project but also be very mindful of each person's individual Styles and how the team reacts to those Styles and how the team Works overall.

So generally speaking while I am one of my greatest strengths is that I am incredibly focused in my work. I do spend some time analyzing and planning out projects that work that I'm going to do. So I do think that I'm a very Strong employee because of that, that I'm a very strong. Like, Focus worker. I'm very good at tackling big projects and big task. Some very ambitious. It's like people tell me that I'm incredibly focused. That people are often impressed by my focus. I will buy it by like how long how much time I can? Dedicated to a project how laser-focused they can be towards projects, especially towards things that I find difficult or towards things that really get me passionate. But at the same time, that could be a weakness of mine as sometimes I miss small details because I focus so much on projects. So that is one of my weaknesses. But generally I consider myself a very Strong and focused employee and worker in general. I'm very good at working in a team. I'm walking along the team player. I support the team, I support the whole and general. I feel like I bring a lot of value to the teams that I work until the workplace is that. I'm part of Um I guess I'll other weaknesses that I have see. Like I said, I am a slow starter so I need that some nice sometimes. I do need a lot of not a lot but I need some time and space to Plano my projects and the work that I'm going to do mostly because you get very passionate about my work and very prideful about the things that I do. When I do something, I want it to be done, right? And I want it to be done. The best I wanted to be the best it can be. So I knew I don't like leaving doing things halfway and I don't like things to be done terribly. I don't want them to look bad. I want it's like every day every project and job that I do and needs to be a reflection of the things that I think about myself.

Like, like I have bursts of impulsivity out of nowhere, but they usually, they're not without, they're not, just like random for more, like they're like calculated actions. He does think like I'm a little bit lazy and the slow starter but he doesn't think that those are bad things. Like he does things are bad but he also thinks it Those are a result of my strength which he believed it would. She, he thinks like, you know, that I'm analytical and intelligent and there he also thinks that my mind is like, very creative that, that's why that because of that, I spend a lot of time analyzing things are watching things before, you know, deciding to do things. I also think I'm, well, this is just me, but I believe them, you know, like, I'm not sure like how much of what he says is true but I have heard it from other people so I assume there must be some truth to it. So I assume that my impulsivity comes from also from my being analytical, that sometimes when I'm analyzing things, I find Solutions were ideas and I act on them. You know, randomly, not randomly to me, either there. Applying to actions, but to other people, they might seem randomly. Why is he doing this? And it's like to me, it's like, it's like I see an opening or an opportunity and a try to take So yeah, that is more or less. How my best friend would describe me?"

And then I would really, you know, be reflective. On, whether my annoyance was justified or not. And then wait, for an opportune time to be able to bring the cause of whatever noise happened.

Sometimes, I put myself too much into a project and I spent up to 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 5 a.m. doing the same project over, no continually. it's one of those people on those people who gets too involved in their work and so I I'm that guy who ends up being dumb enough to hate to say that dumb enough to continue doing the work even after long after hours."

You should see what they've done in originally, he was he was actually a security guard beforehand, but that's another story me. Personally, he describes me, he's so far told me we're brothers, he's always told my, this is the funniest story ever. My mom calls him my unofficial. Other and my dad had said that to even though we're from two different families, two different two, different Lifestyles to from places, it's, it's kind of hilarious to see every time he shows up to our family events, so we try to stay as close as possible. We call every day we talk. And again, I'll say it again. He usually says that I'm the person that you should definitely be going to first when it comes to having problems.

So at so working, as a project manager in the type of work I do sometimes you're developing apps, sometimes you're developing physical products and sometimes or developing given number of other items while you're at it. Now, during these developments sometimes of the the client itself from art that's out, catching to our firm wants to me to beat faster and my cut deadlines. Sometimes they want to cut the they'll give me a bonus based on how fast or how efficiently do the job. So nine percent of the time I end up having to dispute the product and sometimes we have to slow down and all dead serious. I hate sacrificing. Hate giving speed the second and sacrifice quality of a product. And usually I tell the client that, if you'd end up trying, if you try to end up killing the quality, you're going to get bugs in the apps. You're going to get unforeseeable items in the project. And trust me when I say this, I'm an honorable and I'm also what you call a collaborative. Person got to, excuse me. I have Asperger's so long story short we try. I tried the best, my team to get the best quality product. We can even it means the project being a little later than the client wants. Now, I don't mean as in Like we're going to be delaying the project completely four months weeks days. It will still be within their timetable. You'll still be within there in the estimate, we gave them but usually we won't get a bonus for being super fast. And yes, yes, it does. Sometimes, that bonus would be a nice and handy to have, but on the other end, I don't want to have a deal with later on having to hear about the bugs in the software. The glitches in the in the app, or how we, or how our product keeps falling apart. Short. Short term long term if it's in the long term rather than the short term, as far as the clients are concerned. We try to make sure that they get quality products and they get better stuff. And then the actual person in the end, run the end user being me or, yeah, typical person, or my mother or, like, cousins are in my best friend, or whatever, or some random person down the street ends up with a good quality app without bugs, a good quality game, or a good quality product, like a purse. And again, I'll say it one last, Time. I will not sacrifice. I will keep the Integrity of the product, the person, and the quality."

No, I am not doesn't mean I'm flirty or I'm overly friendly. So usually you have to understand, I like to keep you. I like to stay. I don't have put this the other to be a pro easily approachable. I like to be work like the work, well, in a team player and I do my best to keep it that way. I'm using known for easy person to come to and get advice from so and know. No, I'm not trying to be my team's best friend. I'm trying to be a coach at the same time so you have to be a little firm sometimes and sometimes you have to be very Gruff because you have to make sure that everyone knows that you're not a pushover either and that's it has happened. Before. People have tried to play me, make you some because they think the guy has Asperger's or so he's not going to do diddly Jack. Yeah, right. I do I push hard my team and I make them we get through this together. It's, that's what it's really about. It's about getting through the project and getting through it together, making sure it gets done together. Making sure we all go down together, best the case. So far, I haven't been a losing project. We've never been a failure project. And in fact, we've done everything on time and even early in some cases and I try my best to make sure that typically, it's a very, very casual situation with respect. Respect Lifestyles dress style work style, the whole nine yards and what we don't want is any kind of I guess we'll call it dismember this connection between the Cup team members. We just don't, we also try to work with our managers and we talked off and with them instead of having date, we have daily scrums but we also have weekly check-ins with everybody. It's not just a cat, is a cat. It's not just a little casual. Meaning to make sure everyone's Mentally doing fine that no one needs a break, everyone's doing physically fine. There's no sick people in our group. There's no, it people, the issues. We also generally, make sure that everyone's going through the project, well if there's no difficulties and so and so forth, and I do my best to make sure that everything goes extraordinary. Well typically, We have, I like to make sure that everybody in the group. Is cohesive and again, feeling let it's a very easy place to work with and a good place to be with, okay? I want a safe environment for everybody."

I usually don't even give in to the other person. Usually, I'm quiet. I tried another College riffs. It's a little difficult in the professional, but I think I'll explain it both ways in the friendly sense, the best option. The best way of looking at it is I usually don't if it's someone acquaintances or friends, possibly a friend or worst case scenario. It's some kind of Stranger. Usually, I don't give in to him. I'm just pretty quiet. I let them have their laughs have their insult, you know, and 99% of the time. Usually, the lead me on eventually when they realize, they can't believe me or annoy me, continually, annoy me. It does happen. I do get people who can try to continually annoy me in the professional world. That's a whole nother story. The best thing to do there is usually I contact my my higher ups or I contact the clients higher up or eye contact. Usually, I'll have to contact someone from the main office to help handle that whole thing. Most of the time, my firm is pretty good about keeping an eye on me. So and I don't mean the sense of they look, they look out for me if I report it. So my boss, we had a situation recently, it came up recently in which a person thought it'd be a great idea to continually Talk about the college, they went through the lifestyle, they had and how rich and famous they were, and how I should be doing things their way it wasn't wanting for. I want to say, For a couple of minutes at the end of the project, I turned around contacted their boss. I decide to take it a little time and this time around, I contacted their boss and them know that we won't be working with this guy ever again. That would rather not. Now we were told that we could have said something earlier but we didn't want to honestly we want to get the project done dealt with. So long story short the other person we found out ended up getting we didn't get the mode if he got sent to another department. And so it went up, that's what happens. Now, sometimes that's a professional, sometimes you have to work with annoying people, you're stuck with them completely, you have no choice. Is the only person you handle that job or the only person I trust me. When I say this, the best thing to do is just stick with it stand there and just deal with it, just stay quiet. But show that they can't believe they showed you, they can't do anything to you. It's like giving into a bully, you just don't want to do it."

I guess we'll call it disorganized typical day in my own personal life. If you go beyond the room that you're currently seeing, everything is fairly organized. And I mean, overly organized, I'm one of those people who I categorize everything in my life you have to understand. I have Asperger's. So usually I'm disorder. Well I don't know how to put this, I'm organized and foremost, things, kitchen work, you name it. My home is clean and Route spotless. And then there's my personal space which is actually never. It's an organized mess as my dad will put it so nicely because that's the best way of putting it. There are certain pieces of equipment somewhere. There's derelict software somewhere else and you name it. I've got Stacks and stacks but the thing is it's all organized in the sense where I know where everything is now when you come to my workspace and we're talking my desk, at the office or my PC desktop which I'm currently talking from. Right now, you will find that. They are extremely organized. All paperwork is in the proper places and even then that's been sub, that's been I guess we'll call it sub categorized. I'm one of those people who I have plans. That make backup plans and then they make backup plans for my backup plans and then make backup plan for my backup plan, for my backup plans, for my backup plans. Three hours later, I'm still making backup plans. I can list off through a bunch more backup plans. I'm still going, it's amazing but that's the way I am when it comes to my finances and my software, if you look at my PC, I have organized my folder. So they each have anywhere between 5 to 20 subfolders and each of those sub folders. Have anywhere between five to 200 files and it's one of those things. I don't mess around with my personal space. I am extremely organized when it comes to my work and my personal space, I'm kind of messy, but that's just the way I am on the It's the way my personality is. It's the way I always felt and it's frankly, the way I like the be, if I can help it, I wish I could be better my personal space and I do my best to try.

So, it's You know important for me to help them get to that point. As far as my weaknesses go I generally have some issues with a little bit of organization mostly due to the fact that I'm trying to get things done quickly and efficiently so it's important, you know, that in my mind things are getting done and sometimes I get a little Erratic as far as keeping things organized and straight. But overall, I think, you know, That's not too bad of a weakness being is its, there's a strength associated with that as well. So another one of my strengths I would say is I work hard and I don't mind, you know, working extra hours, I don't mind working weekends nights.

And, and I think he would say that I tend to be, you know, somebody he can really count on and look up to. So, That's how I would think he would. Look at me, I generally I think that I'm a loyal friend so it makes it easy for them or for him to count on me, especially in times of need in times that, you know, obviously your your friends are your friends and you want to be having fun and having a great time, but sometimes bad things happen. And, you know, you have to be able to have those people that you can count on.

My career increase the amount of money I make is this something I want to do. And you know every time that you do something like that, you know it's it's lead you from where you are now to where you're going to go in the future and you have to really take time to evaluate and look at the entire picture you know it would have been easy for me to say you know this isn't where I want to be. Maybe I'll take a step back and A lateral move and try and just do something that might be easy, or I can take this opportunity, learn everything I can about it and move forward and do the best that I can in the position that I've been given and generally, that's what I try to do.

I don't try to push my way in. I tried to sit in the background a little bit learn, as much as I can try to get involved, where I feel like I'm making a difference, try to make sure that They know that I'm there to be a team player to be there, to help them and that I know what I'm doing. You know, it's important for them to see me as somebody that's coming in to contribute and not somebody that's just coming there to take a space.

Then you know you've done your job and Can start to feel a little bit more comfortable in your role and I think I do that because I think a lot of people get in threatened or intimidated. When somebody comes new comes on the team it's like what is this guy going to do? Is you can come in here and try and push everybody around. Is he going to try and say that I know everything? I don't really need you guys or is it going to be a team player? Is he going to say you know this is the kind of guy or you know this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to here to help you guys.

I mean, we're working in an environment where there's a lot of different types of people and you have to be able to understand where a lot of people are coming from and you're never going to see eye-to-eye with everybody. So, you know, less, you know, I can think of situations where, you know, you're on a call, you're in a meeting and somebody is just not, not getting it and it's annoying sometimes and I think sometimes you just gotta say, let them have their moment, you know, and just get it out and you try and sit there. You try to see their perspective sometimes, and sometimes you just know that they're not getting anywhere, but You kind of have to let it play out a little bit and then maybe just try and talk him down trying to get a little bit more of a different perspective on things. Maybe ask him a question in a different way that might help them convey. What? They're trying to say a little bit more appropriately. You know, I try to do that because I don't want to a lot of conflict, you know. I don't think conflict is really good, especially our team environment. You know, want people budding heads all the time because once you start doing that, it doesn't stop and You know, it affects the team to fix the team schools, it affects the bottom line, so you're going to be annoyed.

It's not always my biggest strength to keep organized and keep things clean. I think it's just the way my brain works. I tend to try to get things done, quickly, efficiently, and sometimes I think my work space or you know just my desk in general and It's a little disorganized and messy due to that, I'll tend to look at things later and try and clean them up. But moving throughout the day, it's not unusual for my desk to look like it's a mess. But, you know, a lot of people are like that and it's how they work, and it works for me.

I like to interact with each individual and get to know them specifically one by one. That way I can see how they work together and how I will work with them. That way later on down the line, we can develop an action plan and be a more effective crew. I work in a kitchen and working as a team is essential because we have to make sure we have quality food out every day.

I consider myself an autodidact I like to learn a multitude of things. Variety of different things and gather a lot of information about things that not only at work but also outside of the workplace, you know, things of interest. I'm just a very curious person and so I would consider that one of my greatest strengths as far as my greatest weakness is, I feel that it's kind of in tandem with my My curiosity, I'd like to gather as much information as they can about something before I make a concrete judgment on things. It's just the level of assessment that I like to make on anything within a workplace is in my mind, vital to make a decision.

It was for dental insurance, and I was hired on, as a supervisor, supervisor team of like five to 10 people and have that much experience with management. But I got hired for the position and we were supposed to fly to another state to to be trained on some of the functionality of the call center and when we went over there, we we all kind of You know, as a group saw that it was in disarray, their call center. And we had a big meeting with the owners of the company and, you know, they were just trying to gauge us and and they were, they were making mention also of the status or the condition of the, the call center, in their state. And I spoke up, I spoke up in the meeting. I was in really Urge to or it was just kind of instinctual. It was just, it was a, it was just kind of, I don't know where, but I made mention of certain factors that I saw from previous experience, working in a call center, that should be implemented and we went from being trained at their call center to actually training their call center employees. It was a complete left turn to what intention was to go over there and we ended up training. Their people, their staff on certain procedures in certain policies and in certain ways to to, to be with the customers to strengthen their customer base. And so I was, it was not noticed that they would, they definitely paid attention to the suggestions and they paid attention to the I really do a really good attention and was going to be offered a position to actually be the director of the call center over there. Which was a massive Leap Forward, and a considerable pay raise just from stepping up and and making some suggestions or expressing my opinion. You know, in a meeting."

I just previously gave I worked for call centers for years and I was working for the phone company where I was doing troubleshooting. And one of the managers, there was an old manager of mine who was actually hired at a new company, it was a call center for burn insurance and he cherry pick me and I said, you know, I'm going over here, I'm going to be have a higher position. I want you to come with me and so I went over there. He picked a think one or two other people who had worked with me there. And so there was two or three people who had known each other from previous call centers and we were tasked with hiring other managers other supervisors for the additional positions that needed to be filled. And so so, we went through the interview process of several people hired, a group of people and this was It was interesting to see, you know, me and the two other people kind of interact with people. We hadn't worked with before and try to build and create a relationship. A functioning relationship with with with fresh faces. It was it was, it was fun, it was fun having the ability to culture, new relationships with with people in a In a work setting, especially having, you know, half of the people that you have known for years and work with and then integrating new ideas and new people to fill those spots and not make anybody feel alienated or left out, which was imperative to make everybody feel. Like it didn't matter if I known you for for such-and-such years with what other companies that you were just as. As open in your ideas were just as welcome as as anybody else. There wasn't any many partitions. There wasn't any exclusions you know we all had a you know function as they as a group team. So there wasn't any president As to whether you were a veteran or not."

You know there's been disagreements. Usually since I'd like to absorb as much information from different you know, points of view I usually Don't I try not to react? I'm not perfect. I think if I have a sound conclusion to any given situation that I'll express my opinion, but not blindly, I don't try to just talk about things that I don't know, so I'll let someone speak their peace but if I'm forged in an idea, it's going to be a thorough back and forth. I don't like To be argumentative. I've had people annoy me, it's natural, but I try not to let either me or that person get the better of a situation and come to some sort of amicable way of concluding, whatever disagreement or or in a way to pacify the annoyance. I have with someone you know I want to hear I have to put myself in other people's shoes and I think that that's why I react the way I do with just letting them speak their peace and not escalating things. I think the way, the reason I react the way I do with somebody, that annoys me is is, is it I have to take into account, is it me personally? Am I taking it personal for a reason? Or is there something going on in this person's life that, you know, it's it's that paired with the fact, that You know, it might be annoyed by someone because it reminds me of a character defect that I have, but I try not to overreact in those situations.

But, you know, a little bit of ADHD, kind of kicks in. I think that, you know, that's, that's something that I've grown to live with having a flighty, kind of attention span And I tend to gravitate towards a multiple things at the same time, so it can make things pretty disorganized, but I find that, you know, I try to spin it on a positive and use it to the best of my ability. You know, having such a vast array of interest in different things. I try to keep it at least in the same subject. So if I have work tasks, If it's, you know, I try to keep that at least in the same, the same subject keeping in the same subject would, at least help me kind of piece together, certain parts of it and I keep everything completely fragmented. But I like to kind of jump from task to task and I mean, I have enough attention to accomplish and and Achieve goals and in actually complete my work most of the time but I can get pretty pretty sketchy sometimes when you have a lot of different projects in front of you. And so it's kind of a balancing act and I try to maintain as much as I can."

I would say would be one of my weaknesses and what a my greatest strengths I would say would be that. I am a really hard worker. I am eager to learn new skills and abilities. I am a quick learner as well, and I am very eager to solve problems and find the solution to a problem as well. And I won't stop until I find that answer."

I usually behave quite strategically and I try to plan ahead, especially when I make big decisions like that because I try to ensure that I'm thinking ahead in terms of the future and planning ahead and making sure that the decisions that I'm making now are kind of positively affect like feature outcomes. And I think that the reason that I do behave in that way, in those situations is because I try to balance the amount of risk that I take and I typically am risk over. So I try not to take on too much risk. in case things go sideways or things, go south or The event is not like I predicted that way. I'm not I don't have too many too many eggs in the basket that I have to worry about if things do go wrong."

That way, I can learn everyone's strengths and weaknesses and Do my best to contribute to the team with my own strengths and that way, Mike, I can cover use my strengths to cover their weaknesses and vice versa.

And I think I act like that because they deserve to, for me to get back at them, if they've enjoyed me. And that's just how it is. And that's just how I feel about it. And if I had to add something more, I would say that. if I was if I'm being serious, when I think of situations, when someone annoyed me, I try to brush it off or to just Turn the other cheek I would sir."

I would say somewhat typical of me because at times I can be disorganized and have just things, astronaut strong around. But other times, I can be more tidy and have my workspace more organized, because it makes it easier to find certain things and to navigate around the workspace. And I think that is because it's just easier to stay organized or find things when things are more tidy."

And I think my greatest strengths are without a doubt, my hard work, the creativity, I bring and the ambition and whatever I'm working on. I think my hard work has shown through the past work. I've accomplished I always give 100% with whatever I'm doing and it's always I can't be satisfied until I know that it's perfected as far as the creativity, I think. That's been one factor that has gotten me this far in life. I think I really try to be someone that thinks outside the box and really tries to be unique and stand out. And I think those two things combined with ambition, when you're really motivated to do what you want and accomplish, I think that immediately is a formula for success as for the weaknesses. I think at times when I'm first starting off, I'm a very much a visual learner and Sometimes things might not be that way so I might be asking a lot of questions or really push the questions in the beginning to make sure I'm doing everything right. So I might not take the initiative that they might want sometimes in the beginning, but that is more just because I do want to do it exactly how I want it to come out. So those is what I would probably say my greatest strengths and weaknesses are"

And this is a very easy question for me to answer because I in fact just went to his wedding and I gave him at the best man speech, so I can describe him perfectly in the speech. I brought up things like the dedication, he has for his family, his Charisma, and just his overall storytelling, I have always admired, I think it even as shown Own in his work himself where he's gotten to his life. He has a beautiful family and I think all those things I've always really taken inspiration from and it's been inspiring to watch. And in terms of his Charisma, I've always just been he's we've always gotten along because of just that Charisma and even just small things like, if we're out of store, something he'll be cracking jokes with the cashier and making them feel like they are truly a friend of his so all of those things, I would probably describe my best friend, is that"

The question is think of situations where you made a professional decision, that could affect your status or how much you made. And I think if you've been in the workplace, you've definitely made a choice in life like this before. And I think when it comes to a, such a big situation like this, I always need to think it through and really think of the pros and the cons and how everything will eventually play out. And if it's going to be worth it, just like last year, when I had to Either accept a project or not accepting the project would require me to do a lot of work and it would put a lot of pressure on me, but obviously the benefit of it would be great because of the payout and everything and it would be very much worth it financially. So I just have to weigh those things if I'm able to fully do it to the best I can and if those everything really lines up, then I know it's it's right to take or not to take."

And I think in general, when I'm in a new environment, I very much try to get to know everyone in that group and so not only I feel comfortable in the situation but they also do and I think if it's in a work environment, that's only going to increase the level of work and results that you guys are going to end up working together and putting out. Out. So I think I'm usually not the per type person. That is immediately going to go in that group and try to take everything over. I very much am the type of person that can adapt to a lot of different groups. And I think it's a lot of fun, a lot of time to just see how that group works and which how I could fit myself into that to then better the group in general. So I'm not the new person in the group that's bringing it down and I'm only only coming in here and lifting it up."

Why do you think that is? And I think in general if there is a situation where someone is annoying and there's an opportunity to even let them know or it's affecting other people. I will very much be someone that will speak up and say something I think you need an example even a couple months ago, I was at a theater and kids were being extremely. Loud. And I did happen to say something because I think it was the benefit of everyone in the theater. So I'm definitely, I think I'm also very good at just reading the room and if it is a situation that it would be best if I were to just remove myself too so that I don't have to deal with that annoying person anymore instead of confronting them. Then if the room is that way, then I will do that. But for the most part I think if someone is annoying and The situation is, right? I very much will stick up for myself and you know, do what I think is, right."

And for the most part, I think to be the most efficient at my job, I thrive when my environment is clear so my mind can be be clear at times. I do think when I'm working on a project for a long time that eventually sometimes does build up maybe the Clutter because I may be planning a big project and I have a lot of notes and everything together. Around. But if I do want to be the most efficient especially to start off, I need a clean environment as almost like a clean slate. And I, it is kind of typical towards the end if I'm working on a big project that my workspace is kind of messy, but that's almost a result of all the hard work and effort. I've been putting in to really Thrive and succeed, in whatever project I'm working on so-so. It's definitely something that I always want to have a clean environment but you know, when you are working on a lot of stuff, it does get messy at times and you can work around that.

And because of that, I work extremely hard to make sure I am successful. So I always make sure I put in the extra effort. Everything you need and no matter their I'm getting time off from sorry extra time or whatever. I'm always putting in the effort to make sure I complete the task. I need to do regardless of how much time I need to put into it with the ties into what I think is. My greatest weakness is that I can get a little carried away with what I'm doing. It's a little hard for me to focus on. On other tasks when I have an important project in mind and focusing on and that kind of takes a lot of my attention and I focus a lot on that.

On my mind I would be true to character true to who I am and then let that decision you made in the ramifications or effects of that people. They are so perfect place to have this. How much I make. I like to sort of do the same thing. If not let anything affected and I'd rather do that because again I don't want to not be true to who I am. I want people to know that hey what you are looking for and what you are kidding. So you're actually going to get, I'm not advertising something showing something that's not actually me.

I like to talk about things, I enjoy get to know the other people and I kind of noticed myself taking the initiative and doing that, just because I think one of the main reasons I enjoy that as cuz I'm person that enjoys speaking acting other people and I don't really like there to be that awkwardness initially happens when you meet a new person. So I kind of go out of my way to make sure that introduce myself to the people. I'm with interacting with. And that just eases the tension, makes everything lighter. Let's just get to know each other and then form a better connection and have a better time because most comfortable one. Another General, that's what I do.Yeah, the reason I can't I think I do it just cause I don't like it being awkward. And I noticed that sometimes people don't take the initiative and do things.

Why I'm annoyed and get to the point. That because it might be a problem on my end if it is, it's my job to work on it.

I work very diligently and thoroughly to ensure that all requirements are met. That customers have a good experience that. That all regulations are upheld. So and for weaknesses, I might be in the beginning when I'm learning something new, it might be a little challenging. However, after that after I'm able to get over the learning curve, then I should have no problems."

Always looking to have to bring some sort of Easy Spirits, uplifting spirits to a situation. And they would also say that I'm very determined after when, when I'm trying to do something. If something needs to be done, then I will like a reaction. I will find typically, I will find a way to get it done. Instantly is as soon as needed. And I also Since I like to perfect, I'm a perfectionist. So, since I'm, because I'm a perfectionist while doing jobs they, my friends will typically say that I am very, very thorough when what I do."

And the reason that I made that decision is because while normally a job that I have pays pretty well, there does not seem like a lot of opportunity there. so, Typically I would have stayed there. But as of recently, with advancements in technology and that sort of thing, as, as I'm getting older in the world is also getting older and progressing. I decided to go back to school. And the reason that I made that decision is because I believe that there is a lot more out there, and I would like to be a part of a team. One day that can, Is making, this is changing the world for the better. There's a lot of ways that artificial intelligence for instance will be incorporated into a lot of aspects in our daily lives. So I wanted to be a part of that."

And the way that I usually behave is more reserved. Quiet notnot, exactly quiet but not also not being very social So more professional in a work environment is how I would usually react. So this would be during the learning phase of learning what all is going on, getting to know people and what they're like, that sort of thing, just filling out a new situation. And I do that because I would just like to familiarize myself with my surroundings and understand what's going on before I play a major role before, I have more more interactions with other people, I would rather just get to know them and everything else first."

Typically, it's just a disagreement of opinions and I don't want to elevate the situation. So I'll let them continue to speak and I'll listen to their opinion and maybe even agree with them. just to neutralize the situation and I might not even say my own point of view because I again I don't want to elevate the situation, so that would be typically. Anything that can avoid, confrontation is my best answer and that's why I try to avoid these situations."

Any disorganization usually comes from it could be one or two or three quick simple and easy fixes. They're just laying around that take no time at all to clean up and I typically tend to be like that because I would really like to know where everything is nobody. I don't, I don't think that most people would just tool. Like to be searching for something during while you're under pressure or in that sort of situation. So I just for the most part I attend to be well organized and it needed. I can I can Do whatever is I have the tools available to do what I need to do."

My boss was actually out of town and gave me a cap limit with her personal money on this. She really wanted this material. I watched it closely for three days. I hear that there's going to be a sniper towards the end. It was a very high some item. It went over the limit cap, I made the decision to just that and raise it, I continued to do that.

She's not bulk of the price. She expected that, and she was happy that I was like, I knew her enough to know that she would want me to do that at work out for me.

However, it's not always to the book and that's something I've been criticized of before. However, I do No, my sister home.

I'm hard-working. I'm always willing to help somebody out. I'm kind of an approval junkie, so I guess that can also play into my weaknesses at times.

But that's just mainly because of my family. I don't want to be away from home as much as that job would probably require, so I opted to to pass on it.

And also as tell them why I'm doing it, you know, you You just don't tell how to do something, not tell them how to do it. My weakness is Is. You know, you know, doing it the how I want to, I guess it is, you know, you know because everybody's got their own way of doing it. So my weakness would be maybe doing it not correctly, the way, you know, you're supposed to do it but at least a 10 it made the same result. So I would think that, that would be one the weakness. Usually, it's always Strong point. And that's probably that's why I always been in charge of, you know, super manager, you know, QC all that, so, because of that reason. So my weakness is, you know, you know, just not doing it way. It's supposed to be, I guess, but, you know, Daniel stops are the same. And my quality of work is same. So I guess that's it. About doing things that we think of, as a, our weakness far as I know, but a lot of people fire sale on Earth language, maybe it's, you know, your physical ability to do something, are you mental? I don't think it would be mental, but there are some things that, you know, well we all need, help doing it. And you got to watch how you do things.

I'm very good at getting along with different people. I'm not someone who feels like, I need to be in charge at all time. So I don't have that sort of Need for control my weaknesses. You know, I'm very much a perfectionist, which means sometimes, I will spend too much time on a particular problem where it's like, I could finish it and it would be good enough. But instead I have to keep picking at it until it reaches some level of perfection in my own point of view, which means sometimes I will work a little more slowly but that also can be a good thing because it means I'm not putting out work.

I tend to be very kind of quiet, and reserved, unless I know you well, but I think if you asked one of my best friend's to describe me, they would describe me very differently from that. They'd say, she's someone who is extremely creative. She thinks outside the box, sometimes in very quirky and eccentric ways, she is very quirky and eccentric in general. She's someone who comes up with really innovative solutions that perhaps somebody else would not think of and she's also really really highly loyal.

I try not to think too much with my head or with my God, I try to go with, you know, a mix of head and heart or head in gut as it may be. I don't want to make a decision that feels somehow emotionally or ethically wrong to me. Even if it's one that might, you know, work out financially, I need to do things that feel right in all of those different ways. For example, I have I've published a couple of books. My want to buy career paths is trying to become a successfully, published author, and I've published a couple of books. And the last book I published was with a smaller publisher. And they wanted to publish my next book as well, and they made an offer. But it was a small offer and it really was. I knew this was not the home for this next story. So even though, you know, it's really scary to have a publishing Offer in hand and turn it down to try to find a different home for the book. But I did that and I really have no regrets about turning them down and knowing that that book was meant to go somewhere else. So I really think it needs to be the right thing and not just, you know, the financially correct in the moment thing."

Any in a really severe situation, you might have two professional situation, especially you might have to politely explain why you're annoyed. You know, for example maybe someone missed a deadline and it's in a way that you because maybe, maybe you're part of the project is dependent on them finishing. There's and, you know, if it's annoying, it's like that. You might gently, you know, explain to them why it's annoying, but otherwise, I think it's best to just let that Go most of the time because it's it's not worth creating work, place conflicts oh no noses. And I've seen a lot of people get into a little workplace, Waters everything it's just not worth doing."

There have been times when I have entered workplaces, that were not organized at all and as much as possible, I'm a good getting it organized a priority because if you don't, if you don't have everything in order, it's it makes it difficult to to achieve goals. Goals performance has. So sometimes if it's a new workplace, you're into you, you have to spend a little time, getting it organized. Otherwise, you keep it organized and you have a lot less problems. You're able to perform work more quickly."

I want my work to adhere to you know when I see someone, when someone sees the work that I do, I want them to feel as though it's something that I've done nothing, we recognize that I put a lot of effort into it and I want them to rely that it's good. One of the weaknesses I have is probably communicating with people with whom I don't necessarily get along with super well. I think that There would be an issue with talking with certain types of people that I may not get along with super. Well, that that would probably represent a little bit of a problem."

I usually Look to people that have done something like that before, I try to find comparisons or try to find mentors that I could use to help me decide whether or not that decision is a good one. I usually try to find guidance either from parents or friends, or preferably someone in my field. Someone that I've worked with before, that's more senior than me. That could offer me advice or help on how to do a better job. Of how to make more money or how to affect my status within the company or outside the company. If necessary. And the reason I think I do this is because to me it seems safest perhaps to be able to follow a well-worn path or a path that's been laid out before you by others."

I want to try to understand who does what and present of kind nice face to the group and an effort to try to make people feel at ease when they're around me. I don't want people to feel as though they can communicate with me for whatever reason or they can't be honest with me for whatever reason. and I think that people need to feel like almost immediately that they could be put at ease when they're in your presence that they can you know either work with you or tell you if something has gone wrong and I think it's just a general feeling of Comfort that you want to establish almost right away. And why do I think that is? I think that most people understand that working on a team, especially in professional environment having a team that trust you, everybody has to work well together and communication, amongst the team members is Paramount. And so ensuring that each team member feels as though they can communicate with me, effectively means that the team is going to get more work done. And then we're going to be better at delivering a superior work product."

So said earlier that, I tend to try to think of myself as someone who does good work, who strives to achieve high quality deliverables, especially in my work group and sometimes people will annoy me when they challenge the work that I've done or they over the try to change what I've done or put a lot of effort into And I think that I need to learn to be more accepting of Challenge and more, you know, willing to listen to input from others. When the quality of my work, maybe not what it needs to be and might need to improve substantially. And the reason I think that is is because as I said, I seem to be very defensive about the work that I do tend to have quite a bit of, you know, passion invested in getting stuff done and in getting the the work that I need to get done. And I think that taking a step back and realizing that people are people who are criticizing me off, two more on the same team as I, and they want to help, you know, get a better quality work product out, not necessarily under my me something that I need to work on."

It's typically when I have a lot going on, I typically I'm very up to date on my emails. I like to respond to people quickly. I like to keep my workspace clean and neat so that I can know what I have in front of me or what I need to grab to finish my work. And so it's not very typical of me to have an unorganized or a disorganized workspace. It's typically, it is I typically tend to be very neat and orderly, especially in my work. And in my workspace, I agree that your workspace, reflects how you go about doing your job, and I think keeping it clean, presents to the world into your co-workers and potentially to visitors or people, they may come see you. How you intend to carry your business, The reason I think that is, I've always found that. That's a very effective way. Nonverbal way of communicating respect for yourself and also respect for others being organized. Allows you to Address things in by level of importance and address them before they become a real issue. But you, and you also address people, you never forget about someone, you never Overlook something. You're always on, top of all the numerous tasks that you have to complete."

Well generally I am hard-working I try to be the best at what I do. I do love poker so that's what I'm focused on. So I might not be the greatest tip for your job but when I do put my mind to something I can accomplish it, So that was my greatest strength is my mindset. My weaknesses would be my disorganization. I can't stay organized to save my life. So I'm just being honest there. I remember when I was in school. My met, my at the messiest desk in school and all my papers, get strong, man. I don't know what it is. I have a notebook. So so that's my weakness is disorganization. We're at 1 minute. So I should be good. And then my strength as I said, would be my mindset."

Mainland, he described me as a good friend, fun adventurous. We used to do everything. We went to football games. We used to go out hunting for mushrooms together. I went to school every day. We skateboarded. We did a lot of fun stuff. We played video games. You know, that's when we were kids. Now, I don't really have a best friend now that I'm getting older. ER, It's more like, you know, my family acquaintances and then I have I do have what I would consider a best friend but she doesn't really like me too much so so I don't know if you would describe me probably is annoying number one, then she says, I'm annoying. So what I don't try to be you know just I guess it's in my genes and I do agree my voice is kind of annoying but yeah, I'm not trying to say bad things here so that's probably how she would describe. Grab me the number one thing."

How much do you usually, behave are my TV, how do you usually be able to tuitions? Why do you think Okay, so probably when I decide to send out to my old customer list, if I would not send an ad out, I'm missing out on money, because every time I would send maybe two ads a year and every time they would buy off me, you know, the same people would read by my intellectual property right up like, you know, Sports Consulting, you know? Just for entertainment purposes, only maybe a method on how to win at the slot machines. And stuff like that. I was selling really good on eBay long time ago and I think I could have made better decisions if I would have kept going and I stopped and got into social media. I would be rich today but I just stopped. So, I ended up missing out and that was from not knowing I was from being ignorant. So,"

Taxi was the last time when's that through a 24 hour class so you could say that and then I joined into the group became a taxi driver might behave, quietly and cooperatively I don't ask too many questions unless I feel it's important and they're not exploiting themselves and that's just the way I like to be a perfectionist and know everything what I'm learning. It might Take me a little bit longer to learn things, but once I do I get really good at it. So, for instance, my website, when trying to build four, About six months and I haven't finished but when I do maybe it'll be a good website, I think it will be because it's already pretty good but I want to perfect it so but yeah, I can't think of any other circumstances where I've joined a team of new people."

I've always asked why people are others too annoying them. And so I'm not morally one of those people that gets annoyed lately as I'm getting older and more grumpy old man, I'm starting to get a little annoying things, but for the most part compared to others, I don't see myself as being an annoying person. Just deal with things as they come. I have a lot of health issues. So, that's that's what really annoys. Me is just a Non-Stop tightness in my body and it's all the problems I'm going through its chronic illness. So there's no way to get around. It's never going to go away. So I mean but when somebody annoying me I can't really think of any think maybe when they won't like if I'm talking to like a narcissist and they're asking me a question that I answered and they interrupt me And then I'm trying to talk over them and they just keep, they won't let me answer that that annoyed.

So, I mean, I can think of situation many situations pretty much all of them. I'm Nick, I'm just never organized. So that's very typical of me. I don't know why that is, maybe it's in my genes. That's like I've tried my hardest to be organized and I just can't do it. It's like one of those things are just not meant to do like some people. They go for the day-to-day try to play poker and they just can't do it. And then it on my first tourney, I won first place. So it's just one of those weird things. Everybody's good, at certain things. I am horrible at organization. And that's about it. But I could think of times at school work, basically, my papers were strolling around. I write notes everywhere. My short-term memory is not good. So I'm writing a lot of notes and I don't really have a organized notebooks. I just writing stuff everywhere. Yeah, so I guess that's about it for that one. I believe thank you so much for the interview. I really appreciate it."

I'm really good at coming up with original ideas, but I also love giving feedback and accepting others individual ideas because I can really work well with other people in that way. However, one of my biggest flaws or weaknesses I should say is that I do tend to sometimes be sensitive to criticism about my ideas. So I always try to balance it out by taking a little time to step back, reflect about the feedback. I Thought of or received and then think of how to properly respond and handle that feedback and really take an in-depth look into whether or not it's valid criticism or not. And I feel that more often than not, people do have a good point in that, I should listen to them."

Come up with a plan to get you out. Come up with a second plan to get you out. And then think of everything that could go wrong and try to repair for going wrong. In those situations, I try to stay really calm that way. I can think straight. I can give it my best effort, I can come up. Up with a great solution, a great plan and then act out on the plan. Um, I think I just know that keeping keeping cool hearing hard and stressful times at work is just a necessity. And so often, I can just really find a way to Zone myself, into that place and then stay there."

See who's straight, who's got like a really good rapport with someone else? Like is this person more bonded to this person or they were bonded with that person? Analyze how the team works? Is this person like to do this task? Do they like to not do that task? Are they fast at? At something. Do they specialize in something that way? I can slowly integrate myself because I know that being in a team is it's a team, it's Cooperative, it's not something that you can just put yourself in and then immediately take over or try to make about you because you've got to fit in rather than fit out."

Stay in the situation realize that they don't understand that they're annoying me. Maybe it's just like some small tick. I have like, they'd like to talk with their mouth full or something like that, and I tried to just ignore what I don't like that they're doing, but still listen to what they're doing. Even if that means, I'm not like Facing them when they're talking or I'm not responding like instantly. I'm just trying to weather the storm of the situation and just react as normally as I can. Because I know that if I don't react normally, it can just lead to a negative outcome. And being annoyed isn't a situation where you were just like Elevate anything else. Because I mean, lots of people get annoyed that a lot of other things. People do people don't like when others do hand gestures and stuff like that. That.

So for example, I'll try to keep like objects together like pens and papers notepads pencils, like stuff like that together but maybe I'll have like a cup of my bottle of water on my desk or something like that. And then like I'll try to put like something that expresses who I am. I'm like maybe it's a little toy. Maybe it's like a trophy of like one of my sports teams, some kind of souvenir something like that, that maybe it doesn't make it disorganized, but it gives it a little bit more personality. So it's clean or maybe it's not like it's organizers. It could be where it's like, only my office materials are on my desk or only my work materials because I try to just make it like a more reflective way of how I am. or maybe I'm not like 100% on the Like clear head.

I'm able to adapt to things really quickly. My current job is very fast-paced instrumental. Sometimes you have to really just adjust on the fly, if something goes wrong, but I'm pretty good at adapting. Whenever something goes wrong, I can solve problems pretty quickly, but as far as weaknesses go, I'm kind of a little bit of a perfect perfectionist though, so I can maybe take a little bit too long to do some things, just because I want to make sure that they're done with correctly. But most of the time, I'm moving pretty quick. I can get upset. Pretty easily. Sometimes if something will see, if someone does something wrong, I'm going to call them out on it.

I'm always trying to make them laugh and like to think I'm a succeed for the most part, they probably say I'm a hard-working as well. They know, I've got two jobs and I've also currently in school as well. So I'm working my way through school. Pretty much always on the go. It was working hard. So I think there would say that about me as well. I'm pretty pretty punctual if we say that we're going to do something, I'm normally the first one there, very early and I'm waiting on everyone else to get there.

Out pretty much straight away. And I brought it back the next day because I was I was very driven and motivated to get the promotion because I enjoy the job where I'm at, I really wanted to move up and be in a leadership position and I was able to do that with his guidance and with his help and I'm just very driven to want to be the best because I'm very much a perfectionist.

So, it's nothing that I haven't experienced before just moving to either a different location or Or just people have either left and new people come in. But generally, when I kind of go into a new team, I just be as positive as possible, should make sure, they know kind of what kind of person I am. And most of the time they get along with me if they don't, then I try to at least work around that, but no must a pretty positive.

Work, normally I'm pretty Stern with them but I try not to be too harsh because I mean I was young once too especially at this job than working at currently.

If it's like messy, it's it's dirty, it's not organized, its it just feels chaotic, that's not typical of me at all. I try to keep my areas as clean as possible as organized as possible, so I can be as effective as possible. I'm pretty much the same way at home too, and I was kind of that way growing up, my room was never messy. I never liked through clothes on the floor and Ever Had toys everywhere or whatever. I've always kind of been generally pretty organized and it just feels chaotic when when things aren't where they should be and when things aren't neat, I just makes it so much harder work and you just feel like you have less space to get things done. So I try to make sure that my area is always clean and organized. It just makes working a lot easier."

But you know, as time went on I slowly started talking to people talking talk and talk and I didn't need a lot of help with things at first, just trying to figure my way around and, you know, kind of get into the flow of things.

I would have to you know, take boxes and just stack them next to the truck just so that my bins were just kind of a little bit more empty but it kind of backtracked on me and It really hit the fan when I couldn't even like step inside my truck because there were so many boxes. Just piled up that I haven't even actually loaded into the truck yet just because I was slammed trying to get my bins empty while trying to help the guy next to me and our entire, you know, workspace in front of the trucks was just completely messy.

I am someone who tends to make the sacrifice play and really look to try and help my employees and co-workers, with whatever they're doing. Hopefully, that means they help me in return. And I think that is probably my greatest strength, and, or Place. Is that a working with my peers and really working to bring up the floor for everyone around me as a result? One of my greatest weaknesses in any place of employment, tends to be that working in competitive environment. I'm not great with that. I've never been very good at it, but I find it to be one of my bigger weaknesses and I do get quite overwhelmed with the emotional kind of capacity of feeling, like, people are trying to undercut me are not really striving to succeed as a whole unit when people are quite individualistic, put themselves first Over the company are over bringing all of our, all of the employment. Same level, I definitely struggle in that kind of capacity, but on the same line, one of my greatest strengths is, what I am putting situation. Do I have to be independent? I tend to do pretty well. So, even though I do very well in Cooperative environment, they don't do great in competitive environments. I also do quite well independently. I'm very good at kind of forging my way forward and figuring out things as I go. Go long, even if I don't really know exactly what I'm doing yet, I'm very good at kind of figuring out the way follower one of my weaknesses that kind of correlate to that is that I'm not very good at doing things without understanding. Why I'm doing them, I find that I do get overwhelmed by this kind of natural Curry curiosity. I have nothing and as a result, sometimes I hold myself back, And I make things a little more difficult than they have to be for myself. But yeah, that's those are probably some of my bigger ones than employee and strengths."

We both kind of are pursuing a career in the same general field of study, we've known each other for quite a long time. I think that he would probably describe me as a very compassionate empathetic person. We're both kind of driven into the field that we've run into based on this kind of shared compassion. For helping people in ways that we kind of wish that we had helped in the past. I do think that he would describe me as Kind of sucks person sometime. He would also probably describe me as quite a motivated individual. I tend to be quite motivated, especially to him. He also says that I am like an intellectual. He sends that not always in the best way, but I think that's how you would describe me as someone who is constantly kind of chasing the pursuit of new knowledge and increased understanding of things. I do think that would be a pretty good representation of me. I, Description. Great question."

Before they impact my own success working in the medical field has a big Probably the most. Descriptive. Example of all that swearing a decision. I make an emergency room. Doesn't necessarily impact me or my success at work, but it will directly impact somebody else's life. So I think in this situation that I've been faced with him in quite a dilemma, sorry, faced with this dilemma and quite a number situation. my, my My decision affects my output my, you know, work Effectiveness. It's most important to me to make a decision. That means that my output is of the same quality that normally is before. I think about pay before, I think about my own success, I do want to focus first and foremost and providing the quality that I am committed to providing for the company that employs me. Me and Healthcare. Those things kind of go hand-in-hand. Your quality directly correlates to your output, which is patient outcomes. So you make a decision for patient. Outcomes means that you're going to make a good decision forum. Yourself and of your Llorona. and I you know also so again I any situation that I usually kind of Focus on the work quality. Before I even focus on my own professional status on my own money and I guess that's that's just due to my background, my background. It's you know, always been focused on other people."

I know that I can be quite quiet, again, it depends on the personality of the people around me. So I think I tend to be quite quiet for a little bit while I kind of gauge the personality of the people around me. A lot of times of people are very domineering. Have a lot of outgoing personality, spend me. I tend to temper myself back kind of contain myself and make myself some what I love. More laid-back person. I'm just to kind of balance the situation all better, but if people tend to be more reserved, but I am were, you know, what more introverted, I will pick up the role of being a, you know, an outgoing social leader, and kind of really pushing forward and having a lot of energy. So it is for me, the team. Dynamic is always quite slow at first while I can engage exactly what it's like and then I tend to just kind of fit whatever role I think is needed for this team's balance. I think this is because I have a lot of experience with very unbalanced teams teams where we have too many quiet personalities. We have too many lab personalities and as a result of that, we don't become as productive as we. To be, and I think that, you know, in a large part is just something that I really tried to interest by being the balance teammate, especially when it comes to new teams."

So A specific time that someone annoyed me is probably recently. Again I work in healthcare right now. You know sometimes patients aren't the best are like them the best to work with her but I'm your favorite employee even if they're the people you're treating and, you know, getting kind of harassed by an employee based on the way I look are based on me. Not giving them medication. We necessarily want forces medication of things, should be getting. It can be a little annoying. Especially when they keep kind of coming after you over and over and over again and kind of nagging. And I give again, this is an example of what I think is a situation that often and always me, which is where my own expertise is going to doubt him based on what other people want. And the way that people go out, it is just kind of nagging. So that is a situation that kind of, you know, what kind of annoying me more than most. But And I usually react pretty calmly in the situations. Sorry, I've always kind of had that Strand calmness to my personality when I'm interacting with other people, and I do find that that comes off quite well spy even when I'm annoyed. Because I just think that it is always more productive to become rational and down-to-earth. But because of people, if you're annoyed with somebody, it still does no benefit to People Express that of the angry or show that kind of vitriol in my feelings. I with them on it, it'll always be more productive. kind of deal with them calmly in a way that kind of let's resolve the situation sooner then kind of dragged me out, prolong it or make it"

I'm smoking thrives on organization or even striving towards organizations. I've worked in a lot of situations where my workplace has not been organized aware of my work itself, has been organized. and I think in those situation, the way that I ground myself the best and I make myself work, the best is, by finding kind of a strategy to Kind of look forward to becoming organized. It kind of tough thing to explain but I if things are very organized, a function very well, if things are not very organized, I continue to function well by searching for the means to become more organized. So not being organized, is not very typical of me. And I think that's just because I've kind of always Sound of work easier when there is a good system of organization and management in place and as a result you know it's it makes it that whenever I'm doing a job, if things aren't organized, I feel like it is more difficult than it necessarily needs to be. I'm going to be Kingdom much less efficient, use of my energy my time in my resources to get the same job done. That can be done a lot more easily, things were better organized."

And in a bit of a big part of that is is a fear of being judged by other people, worry that that look down on me for me being myself or me telling them.Tell me the showing them parts of who I am. So once I feel confident that they will not judge me, I feel comfortable showing them who I really am."

I have come a long way. working on myself, in that regard, I used to just get angry and not react well to people that get on my nerves, but I think I got to a point where I, I just I realized that acting the way I was wasn't appropriate. It wasn't necessary and It was causing people to view me differently, which I didn't want. so now I kind of kind of silently judge them or I'll keep it in and complain to one of my friends, but I've definitely I'll act as a little bit of a mediator like I'll even if I'm completely not on their side. I'll act as though I am or try to hear them out just to keep the peace. I want to, I don't want to. Be confrontational and start drama over them just being a little Annoying unless it's beyond just being a little Annoying. If it's if it's actually you know to the set of to the extent of being offensive. That's a different situation, but if there is being annoying, I have I've learned to tolerate that I would say. I've had to learn that through experience."

In Scotland, in particular as an American, I've had to be around people who are from totally different walks of life than myself, who come from totally different ways of thinking. So I'm able to work with those people effectively and get things done. If I had to give Give a weakness as an employee. I would say. Sometimes I overthink instead of just going with the flow, I can kind of tend to be like I get stressed over over things and I overthink and gives me anxiety and whatnot. But other than that, That's kind of a nitpick. I don't really feel that I have too many weaknesses."

It's the only person you can be as you. So that's what I would do. Why do I think that is? I think because that's just who I am.

I was the only American in my my master's program. It was mainly students from kazachstan and China and a couple from various other countries, and I was also the youngest out of the group. So, when I got there, you know, I was quiet at first because I'm a naturally introverted person. And you know, luckily the program had like ice-breaking situations where they would, you know, get us in groups and get us talking to one another and get to know each other and me personally, like once I get to know that we have shared interests and what not it's it's not too difficult for us to kind of hit it off. So that's what was able to happen with my cohort and I was able to make some good connections lifelong connections. Why do I think that I'm quiet when I joined a team because I'm just naturally. Introverted, I don't like to talk other than like, online online. I talk a lot but not in person."

If it's all social media, for example, if people say stupid stuff or stuff, that's annoying to me, just instantly block them. Why do I think that is?

You can just block them and move on with your life because arguing with them isn't going to benefit you at all. So"

Well, this this game room that I'm in where I do my content creation, my YouTube stuff is quite messy right now, but that's because we just moved into a new house.

I am most comfortable working by myself. I have in the past worked in teams though, and I have done very well. I have a lot of experience and team building, I used to be in banking, and, and in that situation, you work. Within teams. And I believe my strength though was as a, in a leadership role. I was a senior banking relationship manager. And I used to have a team under me, and I would work to develop sales and work with the community and business banking. And so, I'm really great at doing strength, building exercises, building my team and meeting goals that we were supposed to do. And I believe that's one of my strengths. is are working within a team, my weaknesses, I would say, my weakness would probably be deadlines, you know, sometimes when working directly with customers in a business banking relationship, sometimes, you know, we have our own deadlines but the customer has their own deadlines and so you know, meeting and working with the customers on time, on a schedule, sometimes can be Challenging, just because they themselves, you know, you have to, you don't want to force them, of course, into doing anything until they are ready. So sometimes, you know, we have to go past deadlines just to make, you know, the deal go through. So my weakness would be getting in deadlines on time and so, yeah, I think that'd be good. Your intimate schedule."

I really just want to get it all at once and sometimes that's a weakness because I really don't, I'm not very patient with myself. One of the strengths that I have in one of the strengths that I consider that I have this very strong as that I'm extremely reliable punctual. So, for example, you can always count on me to show up on time. I'm a lot of people these days they say they're going to do something, but they don't do it and it seems extremely hard to even get people to show up for job interviews these days but I'm always somebody who follows through with my word."

They It also described me as being someone who's extremely personable and of Dick hand and adaptable. Somebody who fits well in many different types of situations. And this is this is something that's really interesting to me, too, because it sort of shows the importance of the many diverse situations that people can find themselves in at work on people have been complimenting me my entire life on that sort of thing. So if if I were able to apply it to a job site, Scenario. I know that it would work out for me really well, and I think that it works and all areas. I mean, you have to get along with people at work, so I would be very personable so that would help but also to be in a situation where I can adapt to different scenarios, maybe some of them unforeseen.

I usually behave in such situations by trying to be as professional as possible. That's always the main goal to me. When I'm on the job is being known as, as professional mom above anything else, I always want to be somebody that represents the company I behave in situations like that. And why do I think that is is probably because professionalism is extremely important to me. Personally, I've been in situations before where I kind of them at the Forefront of the company, perhaps a receptionist or secretary Tech position. And when colleagues will enter the business, you might be the first person that they see, therefore, I really want to be in a situation where people sort of recognize my own.

And then I'm there to really, to get to know everybody and that's extremely important to me. And then I feel like, sort of later we can get to the work part. But first, I really want to know how these other people work. And if I my personality might work very well with them, or if I might end up clashing with them part two, why do I think that is? I think that I want to put the personality before the work part of things just because I really Think it's important that I'm going to be spending time with these people.

That there is times when it has happened at work where I've had a knot, a lot of patients in those scenarios. I felt that there were times when I was in situations at work when those people were sort of threatening my image personalism. And perhaps, the way that I looked to others, I took that as As a threat at times. And what I just really did is I ended up talking to the person and trying to work through everything to me a lot of that annoyance kind of came from perhaps they were misrepresenting themselves and or they had lack of professionalism. And this was then impacting, what I would do if we were in, for example, a team environment, I think that I reacted the way that I did probably, because I just didn't want my image kind of tarnished in that way. And if the image was going to be tarnished, generally, I'm somebody that wants to take control of my own image and tarnish that situation myself. If that's the way things are going to go, I certainly don't want to leave that up to somebody else. That's not, that's not it all something. I'm comfortable with."

That's definitely happened before. In the long tenure of me working, I would say it's not typical of me at all. I know that some people work that way and that they kind of swear by that. You know, they have papers everywhere all over their desk. To me that's just sort of asking for things to get misplaced, I guess if that works for some people. That's Perfectly fine, but it just really does not work for me. I would say it's not typical of me because I have not had very good luck in those scenarios. When I have things that are just sort of everywhere, things will get lost, they'll get misplaced, their lack, they'll accidentally get thrown out when a stack of papers get submitted to one person, it could be that it was maybe another piece of paper got in there that wasn't supposed to be. So I really like sort of a place for everything and everything. Everything in its place. That's definitely the type of person that I am in my own office or not. Have that kind of thing going on.

Okay. So generally I'm not a profit motivated individual. I'm more of a lifestyle motivated individual. So when pressed there's been a couple times where I could have either gone to additional schooling or a different schooling than the one I did. I could have picked a different position in my career than the one I did. I chose the one that offered the greatest lifestyle Freedom so I can be with my family and do the things I like to do outside of my career, I find that employment and career is a very meaningful fulfilling part of my life. But only because of the decisions that I have made in these cases, And it always says it's not always been about chasing money. There are roles, I could have taken where I would be compensated more. However, the demands of the job would really not be fulfilling to me for the other aspects of my life. And I think, you know, we talked about balance in the work-life balance in the workplace and I think it's critically important. I enjoy, what I do tremendously. Because of because of the the freedoms I have outside of the work or the work place, had those been different? I don't know that I would come to work with the very positive can-do approach that I typically treated with. So,"

Okay, so you know the the when you enter a new team that is what is it? Forming storming norming performing and I am very, I do a lot of listening and a lot of emulating what other team members do when I enter a new team. Let's see it. Especially in the workplace. You know you're looking to make inroads among the other team members your arm, it looking to standardize your performance and find out, you know, does the behavior that is you're emulating, does that lead to Quality results. So, you know, I wouldn't say I do any majorly, different behavioral shifts or anything on my end, but I do tone down my normal. My normal personality and try to emulate kind of the successful characteristics of the people around me. And then, you know, as you become more comfortable, you let people in on everyone's individual quarks and whatnot. Let's see, and I think I don't do that for any particular reason. That's, I mean, you have to have a certain sense of understanding what other people are doing around you. In order to be successful, you have to be cognizant of the different social mores in each individual workplace, and being a present for those, in the aware is not A bad thing in trying to because every team is built differently and successful team members don't necessarily need to do the same thing or have the same characteristics, but they need to share some some form of operational similarity that allows them to conduct business with each other and communicate. So really, when you join a group, Poop. You should be looking for the things that will be helping you do those like helping you progress with Again, trying to find my words, helping you to find the common ground that you can operate under and share a workplace, share a project load Etc."

Okay, so I can tell you that at work, I definitely mute my frustrating personality characteristics. When someone has done something that I have perceived as either wronging me or making a situation more difficult, I generally don't tend to do well on that per se. You know I'm a let it stew in my head and I come home and complain to my wife about it but I realize it's not productive. Conflict for conflict sake, is not productive and the people I work with are generally professionals as well. So I respect you know that they may be having a bad day or having a frustrating situation occur to them. Piling it on is never helpful and it just adds to stress. So When someone annoys me. If it's a person, I still have to deal with, then I will try to avoid try to ignore the annoyance and focus on the problem at hand. And if it's someone that I can't ignore, I will basically just remove myself from the situation Because you don't always need to be in a spot where you can continue to be annoyed. I mean, frankly, some people are some people are just annoying and some people's actions are just annoying me. That's that's fair. Like, everyone has their times. I just think I've certainly put my colleagues up through the my share. So we just tried to continue moving on with your day and find the area that you can be. Productive."

My workspace is generally, fairly organized. I do my own organization, each member of our team currently does our order or an organization. Basically, when it comes to things like that, all my problems are of my own making. If I don't take the time in, you know, take time out of my day to prepare and organize my thoughts, my plans, my to-do list for the day, then, I pay the consequences. If I do those things, they pay dividends and I have found that some days when I situations out of my hand, like I keep getting pulled into an emergency situations, it does take a toll on the day and you still have to make the time to do those things. I'm fairly organized, I would say more so than some of my colleagues and I always like to have a good bead on what's going on. On. New studies available on prolific figure, that let's see.

Because if you want to finish that up, if you want to make money, you have to do the work. You have to finish, that work load.

It's, it does make me a little like It does give me like a headache, sort of, but I try to get through as much as I can.

I managed to bookstore for six years and it was really important to me that the books kept, you know, exactly as they're meant to be. Arranged by first by subject and then by author that when, you know, obviously nothing upside down or anything like that, but that everything was exactly where it was designed to be. And that the soon as you need to go find something, it's where, you know, where it's going to be. When there's a customer who needs something immediately, you can just pull it out of there. In the same way, my records were exactly as they were meant to To be kept in the same borders and kept in. Excellent condition that I always knew because this was, I'm 58 years old. So, when I say kept in, this means notebooks and excellent handwriting so you would know what the records are and then any of the computers that were being used with, type them in precisely made. Sure the staff knew how to use the computer. Those are so organizational skills. I'm excellent at weaknesses are that I can take too long to accomplish a task. So I would often without any type of overtime Rising be there after hours. Fixing things making sure they're all exactly as they should be."

I have often had to fight for my salary and that is because I'm a professional church, music director and At first, I didn't realize it like, the last, the first three or four years, I started to realize it, and this was in the late 90s, men are paid more and that has never ever ever gone away to the point that they're paid. Like double same exact education center, my skills are better than most of them. Some of them, my skills, have I've been doing jobs that are three to four times the amount out of work that they've been doing. And when I say the pay is insanity, I was making the, the one job I was making about 18,000 dollars. Directing three choirs a bell choir cantor's just as an enormous, huge managerial amount of work. I was doing I sang for the Pope. I played for Cardinals as making 18,000 dollars the man who took my position started at 75 thousand dollars started and then got raises, I know that from the priest who work there who started crashing me about, you should start asking for more money. and the last job I had, I finally got up to 36,000 dollars and it was agreed on when I was when I was, Hired in writing and then they went back on it and said we're having some difficulties were thinking more like 25,000, it's like the first person who is cut as me. I'm not on skills, not on ability, not asking me to do more. but, I end and I insisted on it or said I would quit and they eventually ended up after 43 years. I have to stop soon. So I anyway.

Well, I can think of two different things I've worked as a director for political campaigns for president presidential campaigns for for the state. And so running, a state campaign, you're running into your walking into a situation where there's been people who've been working on campaigns for decades and there's people Coming out of high school and college who are doing it for the very first time and giving them an oversell overall sense of purpose. There's not a whole bunch of different crazy ways to run a campaign, that's kind of the same thing over and over again. So, just directing them finding leaders and finding volunteers and finding pay participants, that's one thing. And then in the church, which I've worked at since the 90s He's as music director, especially with a choir. Coming when every Church you go to will always have somebody there who's been there forever. And hopefully a lot of people who have been working on a team forever and sitting down with them, finding out what they love, what they enjoy doing, what works best for them and being able to bring in new people as you can to to join their work effort."

I can definitely think of what I campaigns working it running and campaigns. It's definitely a whole different planet when you're working on a presidential campaign. And there are, you will definitely work with people who don't know what they're doing. at all, and have no sense of organization that have no sense of it tends to. There are times people who have a lot of challenges will show up at a campaign wanting to worship the candidate instead of lead the candidate orI don't want to get political here. So times when people have annoyed me is, when they can't see a difference between the human who has skills, who was Grant, who's running for a specific position, and how they, and some people have created a God out of that person or a saint, or a superhuman. And so, when you're dealing with something like that, and then the person is now in your, in your, you know, comes for fundraisers comes for events. It's important that the team keeps working. Normally and instead it seems to trickle down this idea of this is a God who just walked in. So from person to person to person as things trickle down. It's not just the level of stress, it's the level of stupidity that starts to take over."

So as I said, there were no, there were just starting with computers at the time and I developed a whole new way of customer service used. Fish, don't know if, you know that microfiche and really setting up an excellent documentation system on paper and starting to process it into the computers and tracking sales.

I always come in 2 hours early before any type of work at all. For me personally being there early and getting connected is the most important thing in the world.

In order for him to get out of marble conjugate, the by it out, therefore I put up all the money, the IRA had as this not all my money but good amount to buy him out of the contract tomorrow so you can keep working for stuff like DC and everything is well too for me that's much more important than just a monetary value, you know? I mean, for me money is not thing I always make money at the end of the day. It's how you lies that money that matters. So for someone they can spend $100 on something and they'll cry about the next day for me. If I spend $100, I want to make sure that each and every single penny of that hundred dollars goes and something useful and that's how I build up my money because at that point that's where you know you're comfortable.

See, you always got learned to handle people correctly. Just going in abrasive. You hate your job. Never think that is never gonna work out because you always going to be Miserable to job, but if you try to enjoy it, if you try to get along with people and try to figure out who they are and what they represent, go farther in life as I've met and dined with a lot of famous people. In New York, New York, pretty much knows my name as this and I enjoy that because I look out for people and they for day, look out for me. It's how it works.

And I would handle that either by ignoring them, you know, moving on to my stuff and everything like that, but I do admit if I'm annoyed, I will get a little update that I can fully admit. It's mainly because I'm very usually a very patient person, but people can't press my buttons. But I always try to make up if I explode on that point the reason why is because it's better to learn from your mess ups then continue to do it and it's hard to you know not be annoyed at some things. Everyone has a button or two that they get annoyed about. But for me I'd rather put it like this is it weird for me to get annoyed about and hurt my whole day. Or is it weird for me to guess, just get annoyed do something positive so we're hey, I did something today. And then, you know, move on from that, that's how I work.

There was one point during peak season. That's the rate of August to December you know, holiday season everything back to back. The boxes were everywhere. We're so backed up and loads that we had to fill up the trucks to the point. We just push packages in, you know, I mean, that was a crazy moment in general but how we got through that is I know how to pack packages. Just like you know, Tetris blocks, if you do it like that, you can fit more packages in the store and stuff in again clutter So, for that, I had to handle seven trucks now. That's a lot of trucks. Now, let's put this into perspective, Each truck and hold about 400 packages per truck. So that's 4 8, 12, 16, 20. You can do the rest of the math.

Well, I would say my greatest strength is my ability to work with other people to be able to take knowledge that is at a very high level and be able to kind of get into the weeds with it and be able to make it sound very technical to People, as well as the ability to take technical information and be able to talk to managers and people that are higher level and be able to take that technical information and make it more high-level to where an executive would actually understand it as far as weaknesses go. I would say sometimes I can be easily distracted. So if Working on multiple things at one time, I'll get them all done but sometimes it's only will only get halfway done. Sometimes I do get carried away and what I'm working. So sometimes I'll mean that I can end up kind of focusing more on one thing try to focus on one thing at a time to make sure I get it done. Right instead of having multiple things that I'm working on, which will kind of be harder to work on than just Focusing on one thing at a time as far as like a nother strength, I would say the ability to work without supervision. I think that's something that's really important to have to be able to understand what you should be doing at your job without having your manager having to micromanage you and yeah, that's what I would say."

My wife is one of those people that think that I am the funniest person on Earth, but she refuses to tell me do is admit to that, but But, but yeah, as far as my best friend, I would say my best guy friend would describe me as funny. Trustworthy kind of having the ability to really be there for somebody to help them out to be everything from someone that can be super helpful as far as if they need help with something work-related, or if they just need someone to be like a therapist and kind of listen to what Problems are and talk about kind of their life and to help them through any issues that they're having. I would say due to being empathetic kind of having an empathy with people, it makes me someone that's really good. At listening to people's problems. Even if I've never been in the situation that they're in, I still like to provide feedback as far as what I think would be something that would be very important to be able to try to help them out in their, in their time of need."

First question is, how do you usually behave in such a social situations? I think being in the role that I'm currently in now, as far as kind of decision that that I make I work with, very limited supervision. I do have the power granted to me to make important decisions and those decisions would be decisions that would help me grow in my career. It would be decisions. That would not just benefit me, but for the, the team in general, which I think some very important, you know, you not only have to look out for yourself but people around you and, you know, when you show that, you're that type of person that can make decisions that are not going to be just in your best interest. But in the best interest of the team. Really kind of helps your kind of status and your reputation, as far as something, that means your team player in that you're looking out for the team. And when you are the type of person, that's the type of people that get promoted at work, places people that are looking out for their team that people that are selfish. So I would say, every decision I make is calculated, I've thought it through multiple times and I Make sure that I picked the best decision and I can back up the reason why."

First question, how do you usually behave when you enter a new team? So when I first enter a new team of people that I'm not super familiar with, I am super shy similar to just how I work in like a room of strangers, you know, if I'm at a party and I don't know anyone there, I'm going to just stand in the corner and talk to that one or two people. That I know there, that would have been the ones that invited Me, i-i'm not really good with strangers once I kind of get comfortable with people, I think that's that's kind of where I shine as far as new teams and new situations. I feel like I'm shy because I'm still trying to figure people out, get the feel for the room and the people and figure out kind of you know how I should talk to certain people and kind of you know, Read the room, and kind of get a better understanding of what I should be doing, and, and stuff like that. Why do I think that is? I think it's a safety mechanism. It gives me the ability to instead of going in and just kind of blurting out stuff and stuff like that. It gives me an opportunity to kind of like, watch what people are doing to really kind of understand. To really be able to read the room and know how to kind of proceed from there."

Kind of go from, where they're working at turns out. He actually used to work at a company that I worked at, and he sent me a message saying, you know, essentially, how did you get from where you used to work, which is where he works now to, where you work now, to kind of climb that ladder of success, you know, I kind of told him what I did, what I recommend doing and stuff like that, you know, keep applying for jobs and, you know, don't don't give up and stuff like that and and I've had A lot of people reach out to me like that, you know, I gave him the same advice and they're like, okay, cool, thanks. And you know, then I can I use you as a reference and, you know, sure why not. But then for whatever reason, this guy will keep keeps messaging me like almost every day or every other day. I was just like hey how are you doing? Like like kind of like wanting to be like friends where I'm not really moaning that like, I'm just here to provide You information to kind of Mentor, you I'm not I'm not really just kind of a very basic boring. Conversation is something that I find highly annoying when people are just very surface level, when it comes to conversations. It's very, it's very annoying to me. I find lack of intellectual conversations annoying as far as why, I think that because it's boring. Like, I just don't like, Talking to people that don't have anything deep to talk about."

So I work with a bunch of dudes. Most guys are organized. At least most of straight ones, aren't we? Do have a few people on our team that aren't straight that are more organized with their work. But when you have a bunch of essentially, when you work with a bunch of guys, you're not going to run into things that are very organized. That's just something that's That's just kind of how it is. How typical is that of you to work or work space? No organized. I would say fairly common, it's not uncommon for me to have disorganized work for me to be working on multiple things at one time. And instead of just working on one thing at one time and then it just takes longer to get everything done. Now, why do I think that is, I think, you know, having ADHD makes it to where I'm not Super organized. It's, you know, I just kind of throw stuff on the floor and I know where it is. Like, I don't need it in little boxes and stuff like that. It's for me, you know, chaos. As long as stuff's not like unsanitary, I don't really mind. If things are not organized as long as I kind of know what I'm doing and what needs to be done. That's usually good enough for me to where I don't. I don't need stuff to be per se organized."

I speak to I don't tell any lies and I just make sure that I use my intelligence and my honesty to produce the best outcomes possible. I like to hear others perspectives. I like, To listen, I like to think hard about things and my greatest weaknesses as an employee is probably the anxiety. Sometimes I overthink a lot of situations and it leads me with like, paralysis by analysis. And I'm just kind of Frozen in time and space but due to that, I think, overall my strengths outweigh my weaknesses and, you know, I was always like, I'm also kind of funny to people always say that about me and I feel like that could light up the workplace and make I'll feel better and stuff. So yeah."

Generally, I tend to be Pretty simple. Like I like to make jokes I like I'm very spontaneous and they know I'm really spontaneous and I don't ever plan anything stuff just kind of happens and that's pretty much how my best friend would describe me, you know, maybe like even cool smart Brave, whatever, maybe not brave. But overall like just positive things because I like to treat people the way I want to be treated positive energy. Get it back and that's what I want. so like overall, that's all I really got to say about how my best friend would describe me and my traits"

Generally the personality characteristics that are involved is the anxiety. I'm always worried about the worst case scenario. And based on that, I take actions that are based on the worst-case scenario. I want to prevent the worst case scenario from happening and increase the probability that the best-case scenario will happen. I think I have a very mathematical brain, I was always really good at math in school and I know a bit about probability and chance. So as long as I can reduce the odds of the worst case scenario and increase the odds of the best case scenario I will do, whatever actions will help me perpetuate. This idea I have in my head of increasing the best and lowering the worst. So that's how I usually behave and I think that's because I hate taking L's. I hate when bad things happen and I love when good things happen. So overall I think I'm very dedicated to the This notion."

I want to leave a really good first impression, I want to make everyone feel comfortable and welcome and invited. And I think this is because I like to treat others the way that I want to be treated. And if I'm being comforter comforting and warm and welcoming, that's how I would want other people to treat me. If they're joining a new team and I'm on team. So basically that's that's pretty much it. Like, I just want people to treat me like a human, just like I'll treat anyone else like a human. Having an open mind, a fresh set of ears, a blank slate, a great first impression is ready to be made. And generally, I am just thinking about these things whenever I approach any new situation because it's important for me to make sure that I leave the best first impression because in life first impressions are everything, you know, and without them, like, what is life?"

I'm just going to kind of like be kind of fake, you know? Like I'll just be like ah, okay and I'm not going to say how I really feel cause I don't wanna be mean to people because I don't, People to be mean to me and I know that I can be annoying, sometimes. So overall like I'll just, you know, accept it for what it is. Let that person be that person and, you know, going forward. I might reevaluate future decisions, but in the present, I'm just gonna, you know, just yet through with that moment and generally I like to do these things because I just don't want to put negative energy out in the air. I just want to keep the Positive Vibes going and make people feel good about themselves and just as I would want to feel the same way myself, you know,"

Honestly, it's pretty typical of me and that's because a lot of things in my life. My main motivators are like money and stuff like that. And me organizing my workspace perfectly, like, in my head. I just don't ever feel motivated to do so. Because as long as it's organized well enough to where I'm not losing things and I can easily do what I need to do. It's like, what works for me, works for me, obviously, It's like a to work for everyone, but if I have a system in place and it's working for me, then it's set to work. Of course, being clean-ish is important, like I can't have a complete Mass roaches everywhere, flies, and mosquitoes, and all sorts of nasty, smells and rotting food. I'd be terrible. But in general, I like if there's just some stuff laid out and it's not perfectly organized. I think it's acceptable and fine as I'm not hurting anyone running. But hurting myself, it's just real life. You know, I use the things that I own and yeah."

I'll start out with those always willing to learn working with teens. Always open to constructive criticism. Always looking to improve to get the best out of my teams.

I would say I'm honest, I'm reliable and always there if they need anything no matter how big or small things like that, I try to always be there for people that are there for me.

It's a little, a little nerve-wracking because you get anxious. You tend to overthink things like, you know what? If I mess up or they going to, they're going to think, I don't know what I'm doing. You know, silly things like that run through your mind but That's with any situation like that where you're around new people, you just don't want to mess up, things like that. But after the first hour, two hours of the day you get to know each other started getting a rhythm of working together, things like that and everything is good after that.

But their job on you and or take credit for your work, things like that or even customers that you just can't, please. They just like to complain about everything and the only real real positive way to handle things like that is to look at it from a third person, point of view, not take it personally. just keep doing what you're doing, and Just do the best you can. And some people, there's nothing you can do to make them happy.

That's kind of a pet peeve with me because I like to have everything organized. I don't like having things in a big mess. I like it where I can find things as soon as I need them. I'll do the same thing in my home. As I do at work because it's more efficient. I mean, it's nicer looking when people Around with their friends or if you're working, a customers or managers or bosses any of that situation. It's just nice to have everything organized where you can get to it. Where there's not stuff in the way you don't lose things or not. It makes the overall overall work experience off low.

I'm very much a Team Elder, I would say, I'm really good at not only seeing people that are maybe alienated or being pushed out of the group because of their opinion isn't necessarily or their feelings are how they want to go about something, doesn't exactly match. The rest of the group, very good at pulling those people in, and Bringing them back into the group in finding something for them to contribute or have their opinion heard. My greatest weaknesses is I hate making mistakes. And so sometimes that can cause me to spend too much time and effort on a problem or certain situation, which I should just go with my first instinct and ghosts go with it. But it's something like, oh, it's not perfect. I could, this could happen, this could happen. I overthink things so that can be a problem. Potentially, like, especially with new things. I'm a fast learner, but I I said, don't we make mistakes. So I tend to take longer than the average person when I first learned something because I don't want to mess it up now, depending on the situation, if it's like, you know, something like they don't the person that wants to thing done like at a job. I just give done. I don't care if you mess it up necessarily, just get it done. I can kind of go with that but in general, I kind of but be my weaknesses. I don't like making mistakes, don't like messing up, which can end up taking too long to do. Do certain things. See ya."

My best friend would describe me as a fairly caring person. Cares about how people feel and how they're doing. somewhat quirky, I guess weird in a way about, like, I don't think in talk like the average person most of the time I feel like, or they would probably say, I hear that from time, time others would be fairly competent figuring things out problem, solver I got fairly humorous person, not like the funniest, like, haha. I'm gonna tell really funny joke and stuff, but good with, you know, quick comebacks and stuff. Like that kind of makes everybody laugh. So that'd be one thing. Just generally good person have around have a good time with, you know, I'm not gonna most people that's going to like, you know, at a party or any kind of event.

The last job I have is a retail job, say it's a, it was a alcohol seller. Let's put it that way. It wasn't like a small Corner Shop. It was a, you know, Apartment Store size alcohol selling company. So, I worked as like a kind of a was called immersion. And iser, which is basically, you know, I feel chills clean stuff up, things like that. And after being there for a while, you know, as approaches like, are you interested in being a skewed? Call the seller, but turn these associate be, so you're helping customers find things. You know, you're trying to sell certain products that kind of a thing. And then, you know, from there, do you, would you be interested in like a management position? And at the time, I was only doing the job part time. I did Super enjoy it. It so I declined the offer to you know do training to become an associate or potentially manager because I only saw the job as like a short-term opportunity. I didn't want to spend time and effort and a job. I didn't think I was going to be there for very long.And I just the time and effort involved in seem worth it, especially the associated Polly had been okay. But to a manager like the amount of work and stress involved are being a manager for like a couple extra dollars and pay just did not seem worth it to me at all. So I had zero interest in doing that for that particular job like in management General. I'm fairly interested in but in that kind of a situation, no, no, not at all. All."

So I came in, as a large group of people that work there. The team of people that I worked with closely, was like, maybe, like eight or so people. You know, generally first kind of introductions, you know, Focus purely on the job, not really on the social side so much, just kind of like Basics about who the people were and then focusing on the job until I get into a comfortable situation. And then I'm coming in a more, social Small Talk, kind of a situation when, you know, you get to know them a bit better comfortable more in the job, you know, when, if it's like, okay to like, you know, Have some personal time to talk about each other kind of a thing. The other was like while ago. Why first First college job. It was like doing it. Work for repairing student computers at a university and joining there. And meeting is a bunch of other student workers. And there's a really cool opportunity to, you know, learn about technology and fixing things. And then also meeting a bunch of students that were there as well. Which is a, it was a really cool situation being with a bunch of similar age like-minded. People was Cool. And we worked fairly well together. Generally, never had really a bad experience with joining, a new team of people to always been You know, show them their work willing to learn kind of follow with the prosthesis and guidelines are. So only really had good situations joining two teams of people."

One that popped in my head is the retail job I was doing. I was cleaning up the spill in an aisle. I had like, the floor is entirely wet both with water and it's like the liquid that had spilled and I had, you know, what science Basically blocking it off and then some guy just walk straight through it. Well, now I was doing was a wet. There is also glass shards in the at the alley, the shopping Lane and he just walked straight through them. Like, sir sir, there's you know, look, whatever it is glass of music, I don't care. I'm not walking around. He just walk right through it. And I remember this like, it was a very annoying. I mean, of course, I didn't say anything other than that, it was just a very annoying situation. Another in school way, back in high school. I remember, it's only time, I really blew up on set. Somebody sky was mocking another student that wasn't there at the time, but it was like, you know, mocking her. And you know what, half the class was kind of laughing about it. I just kind of blew up on them and, you know, saying how annoying he was as a human being and how unpleasant he was I put it that way. Okay. Other than that, there's only two seats choice that I can think of. Usually I can tell when people are potentially being annoying or Disrespectful in a way but it usually doesn't. I don't take it personally that often I just like I get people having a bad day or just don't let it affect me, I guess. I guess I'm fortunate in that way. So I don't have too many situations when somebody annoyed me."

Obviously honestly, I had hard time thinking about this one because I've never been in a very obvious situation. Like, oh my God, this is a nightmare like nothing's. Everything's a mess that nobody knows where anything is or what we're doing or anything like that, you know, there's been times. Especially through retail job, I work that you know, things got very busy and so things kind of like had to you know, you tried your best and so there's things where they shouldn't be necessarily like oh this product should be here but it's not there. Where is it? That happened but it wasn't like all the time. It was a have overtime time in any other jobs. I worked I can't really think of a situation where it was like greatly disorganized rather than just like the lack of space. And so we had stuff we're typically wouldn't be, but this is more like a space issue with less of like not being organized. Like Skies have been fortunate where I haven't been in a situation where that's been very unorganized company or workspace. The times I, you know, have been in those situations. I try my best to make it more organized. Like if we can't find something, I find it and put it where it's supposed to be. I just find it and leave it there for the next person to wonder where the heck it is. I try my best to make it easier. Not only for me, for, for other people. Because, you know, even if you're thinking about selfishly, if you like find something where it's not supposed to be in, leave it there. While someone else is going to have to look for it, and they might come find you in, or the you and waste your time if you're thinking about that in that kind of way. So, even if you think about selfishly, I thinking like it's beneficial to keep things. Is organized if you can help it."

To really be one of those questions that magical dancer because with the weakness question you kind of have to throw yourself under the bus and it's trying explosion, get the kind of toot your own horn so to speak. But I would say my greatest strength is the work as a professional and well-functioning that were integrated and molded multidisciplinary team. So I can work really well with others of different disciplines and as very real I find my strength of Y with respect to the weaknesses. I would say that I do get a little bit in a sense that I really over.

Realistically if it's a situation where the person who annoyed me is done it before and I can tell that the probably going to continue doing it. Then I will have a conversation about Why what they're doing annoys me? What the way I would like to be treated. I try to start the conversation with something like.You'd rather than starting the conversation with like you did X. And I'm upset about it. I try to say something. Like, when you do X, it makes me feel why when you're late, it makes me feel taken for granted. That takes some of the responsibility for the situation and puts it on my shoulders to. It's not immediately saying you're in the wrong and I'm in the right. It's saying, When you do something, this is how I react to it, and that opened that allows a chance to start a conversation. Maybe I'm misinterpreting it, maybe I'm unreasonable to be reacting the way I'm reacting, but having the conversation that way, I think, invites chance for a dialogue rather than just immediately casting blame on someone by saying. Why did you do that? What that I hate that etcetera because that just shuts people down. I found"

It's never a mess in terms of like garbage or food items or anything gross or like that. But I mean, I have a lot of papers around. I have a lot of reference materials. I'm usually working on two or three things at once minimum and I've just never really placed a high premium on having a systemized highly like super rigid system for organizing, my things. I mean, I've never had problems finding the things I need, and I never let my workplace. Become so disorganized or messy that it encroaches on anyone else's space or causes an issue for janitorial staff. Everyone else. So, yeah, to the outside eye, my workstation. On a typical day, probably probably looks pretty messy. But It's not for laziness or unwillingness to clean it up. It's like I said it's just the fact that I'm always working on multiple items and I placed more premium on spending, my time actually addressing those items than I do. Then I do and then I do then I put a premium on devoting work time too. Putting things back into like some neat organized. System only to have to take them out again, if not that day. Then tomorrow I just I just find it. It's a better use of my time. Yeah, I just never really valued having a super organized work space. Like I said, it's never, it's never to the point that it causes an issue for anyone else or that I've ever been spoken to about it. But um yeah that's that's how I've always that's how I've always managed things going all the way back to elementary school. My locker was never organized either."

You give me that bone. I'm going to finish it. Let's say my weakness is maybe not doing enough research. Like I should before trying to tackle something that's brand new. I really think that typically my reaction to items that I've never done before. I just kind of dive in headfirst and figure it out along the way. It's always kind of help me being able to do that. So, I think, in general,Overall, I try real hard if I don't know how to do it. I try to figure out how to do it. They've always been able to do that."

Of the same job and that would be two. head to Department technicians, and that was one of those type situations where The decisions that you made or how you handled certain situations. That was definitely going to affect the fact that you either were considered for it or you weren't. And if you were, it was going to be a pretty good money hike. So pretty much everybody. Wanted it at the same time. Had to attend attend several more meetings than you normally did. but, and going to those meetings was And getting pulled off the floor was definitely different and I learned a lot more about the company than you.

I guess, just go over General. Chat, find out a little bit about the people if you never met him before or maybe you had, but you just didn't know. I think once as a group, we were all put in our scenario where we had to figure out the best option to take two. Excel or succeed for the company. It was just a matter of time maybe a day or two and felt like you pretty much already knew a lot of these folks even though you didn't I just because you had spent so much time around them. Recently got to know their personalities. They got to know yours so I think Good longer year-round, even new people or new team of people the more comfortable and relaxed you become as time goes on. actually might even start having a good time, so, so, A little overwhelming at first but you know, after a couple days you you can pull them to it."

They usually will get the gist that I'm annoyed at whatever they're doing or saying. Especially it were. Sometimes it just ignore it. And be busy and going about your business and try not to let it affect you. Because you don't want to get annoyed every 10 minutes and not get anything done. Or if push comes to shove and it continues to happen, you know, has to speak with them, tell them what's annoying. You And I would hope they would do the same with me. so, I think in general, You pretty much just want to let somebody know that you're kind of annoyed, knock it off and let's move on."

As far as not, very organized, got everything pulled out later around, not a very good feeling, especially when you normally are organized. I wouldn't say that's typical me. It just means I haven't gotten all my ducks in a row, yet to figure out where I would like to put different things or how to set it up, just like moving seems to never end. So, Spend most of your time looking for something instead of getting anything done. So, hey, it's not a good feeling to be unorganized, especially when your Used to being. At least somewhat organized. I think after you're able to put things where you think they should be, and Phil organized, you do a better job and you would get more done."

So whenever there is a project that I need to complete, my always dedicate the necessary amount of time to organize myself. Make sure I have all the things zup to put for the effort necessary for that project. And this can also be one of my weaknesses before I begin because I take a long time to sort of prep before I begin for a project. I want to have everything planned out and ready to go before I begin at times. Depending on the project were the environment that can be a weakness because if it is a fast-paced environment, people might require me to move a little faster than I would want. But generally speaking, I tend to be well organized and diligent in the things that I want to do."

Something similar happened at my previous job where I was given the opportunity to move from one team to different one. That would significantly impact the responsibilities that I had the people that I offer saw in the day-to-day activities that I would engage in. So I think I am willing and open to take opportunities that come my way up. Opportunities that allow me to grow and develop even if a growth and development is accursed laterally as a port as opposed to vertically, I like gaining broad experiences or knowledge that cuts across different areas identified that some of the most interesting, the smartest most innovated individuals are the ones that are able to take problem from one area and apply. Knowledge that they've gained from different area. And like I said, those are typically the people that are most Innovative in that decision-making in the solutions that are able to develop"

So if I wasn't a new team I would probably look for one person or two people that I had some type of connection with either, because we come from similar backgrounds, we have a similar experiences or I met them briefly before the the scene began. For example, I think this is because I tend to stick to a small group of individuals. Generally speaking socially my more much more comfortable personally working closely with individuals as opposed to having a large group of people that I'd have to manage or give different expectations too."

What was it gives is different than most situations. What somebody might be you know, ignorantly or without intention annoying you, but because of those experiences with children, I tend to be very patient. So there's this phrase faith and patience that I tend To repeat over and over. Because most of the time, people are not trying to know you. Most people have don't have nefarious purposes and they're not out to get you. So I tend to remain calm and try to understand people's perspective, so that I can give a response, that will be helpful, not only to me, but to them as well, things from their experiences and whatever challenges they might be coming. And I think that I typically respond like this because I like one-on-one interactions and interpersonal relationships are important to me."

Those are typical views situations that I can imagine my work, or my work space would be the to organize. And that is because I tend to be a very organized person both physically. But also you could say, digitally in the way our I organize my folders in the way that the documents are placed or named or rearranged. For example, I like to have everything organized because it helps me sort of feel at ease with the work that I'm doing. I don't want to be distracted or bothered by things that are not going to affect the end result of the products that I'm developing, or creating or researching."

And obviously, the more sales that you made the better, you look to the company, the more money you made is you make commission, And I had made the decision that I am here to help the customer at their technical problems. I am not such one that will say hey you're having tons of problems with our equipment. Would you like to have even more of our equipment? That's not going to work for you. The heart of a saleswoman when I'm when I'm in the when I'm not in sales, when I'm in tech support, when I'm supposed to be helping the customer with what they actually need help with. I do, what's best for the customer. When you try shoving sales down an Irate customers throat. They're going to hit, they're going to dislike the company and hate them even more. Now, if I got their problem fixed and I understood what services they needed, Then I then I would see if they were interested in adding additional services. So I never got high commissions or you know, I was always pressure to do more sales. But meanwhile all the people that were Dollar sales. People got bad marks and all their other areas of customer satisfaction. So I was overall higher marked than everybody else even though I wasn't a huge saleswoman"

So, I would act very friendly, very nice and I would help as best I could with newer employees. He's or even helping out older employees, as an older to the company not older in age necessarily. Like I would always make sure to help everybody as much as I could. And definitely be a team player and always enter like if say there was a competition, I would help out in the competition.

If it's something that's going to cause problems down the road, either, for me, for them the job, I might try, you know, talking to the person first. If it seems like I can, otherwise I would go to my next level of support and say, hey, I'm having A problem with this person and explain, you know what I've tried to do already what you know what what workarounds I've thought of and how I'm coming to them for help and to see what they think.

And papers that I needed to refer to less often were further and further out. But I was not in rotating on anybody else's space. I would be going ahead and keeping to my own space and whenever I had to go to lunch or break or I was heading home, I would clean up my workstation because at the place I worked, you shared a desk with somebody else. So I couldn't leave my paperwork out because it would be in their way when they when they work next and vice a versa. So I always kept My area clean as need as need be when it was required, otherwise when I was working, it wasn't disorganized.

I don't like conflict. So if I know ahead of time that someone doesn't like Say jokes at all. I won't try to joke with them if I know ahead of time.

I don't like things and tidy or messy but it was It was okay, as long as I knew where things were, but at the point that I started to feel that I couldn't find anything, that's when I started to become a little stressed, and would have to go through and have a good old clear out from, you know, just filing everything away that could be filed away or putting them in different spaces, bundling things together, more than that.

That's what I try to do because I just want to share my excitement with everyone around me, so things are not my weaknesses. I can get bored with the task if the task is to mundane. So if a task is not challenging or a task is able to be completed quickly, probably won't put a whole lot of thought into it, and I would enjoy doing it. So I won't be as exuberant. But that task.

Asked me to leave the company that I was at to manage the Solar Company for them in another state. And that was a Scary decision, I guess to make that to do that. Because on the one hand, it could be very beneficial. I could make a lot more money to pay was better. The benefits were better. Everything was better, but the caveat to that was that it might not work at. All right, so I made the jump and I did do it and in the long run it ended up not working out after a year, the company ended up getting into some some tax trouble and shutting down. so, Why did I ba? I mean that's just I think I did it just because I like change. So like if something is exciting or knew it, I am apt to take that pathway for regardless of the risks to some extent. So yeah."

So, the very first thing as I'm quiet as I observe, and then, as I start figuring out the mannerisms of people, and I start figuring out kind of a little bit of how they tick how sensitive they are as far as there being offended, and other things of that nature. Once I figure these things out, then I will attempt to communication and I will build a rapport with them. The reason I do that is because it's very easy to get off on the wrong foot. Someone and the initial confrontation with someone can determine long-term how that relationship plays out between two individuals and especially if you're working on a team with someone or if you're going to be working in a tea with multiple people, you will do better work if you get along and you will do better work. If you respect each other, if there's internal conflict in that team, that the quality of the work work, Will suffer so that's why I believe that it is important to do that."

Like so, I think my biggest flaw is that it might show in my facial expressions a little bit. But even that I try my best to, I try my best to tone that down but that's that's a hard thing to do. Yeah, so I mean, usually what I do is I just stay quiet, it's just not worth the the confrontation. Now if it's like a major major issue or something has gone wrong that, I will confront it. But if it's just an annoyance like Someone's music or, you know something that's not important in our I don't really have a right to be upset about but it's just a personal annoyance than. Yeah. I just stay quiet and ignored. The reason I would do that is because regardless of whether I'm annoyed about something or not, they're still a right and a wrong. And if the annoyance is not, if they know it's that I have is not Pertaining to the greater, good of the company or the project were working on that. The annoyance is not important enough for me to cause problems, or to bring up and cause confrontation."

I would say when time is of the essence. So if there's a large time crunch happening and you're just everyone's just really pushed to their limit or the edge of what they're capable of doing and the allotted time I think that's when things start to get messy and disorganized, I don't think it's very typical of me just because It's not crunch time all the time, right? So it's not something that happens every day. But it has happened. Yeah, I mean I can think of times when it's happened where it's just everyone is just pulling their hair out and it gets a little messy. Yeah, yeah, I think that if people don't have, you know, it's a Ghillie have so much attention and if you know, 95% of your attention is on getting a project done, and then 5% of your attention is on staying organized, you'll stay organized. But if 100% of your attention is on the project and you don't have any, there's no attention left over for staying organized. You won't stay organized, so it's just priorities. And depending on how important they are for the project. So,"

I tend to be the type that goes out and is able to learn things independently and efficiently which I know is very important, especially given that resources are finite. I also just say my cooperation skills typically I'm very good at being able to communicate with other people and My ideas, guess the greatest weakness I have is that I often might interpret other people.

Say, I have to think about how exactly it will affect my life, my status, and how much money I make. Even if that might not necessarily be the best for everyone, I do want, I am a team player. Generally, I tend to be very focused on that, but I understand that I have to look out for myself in this world and that involves making sure that I make decisions that benefits, rather than hinder me in the professional world, like, my status, serve How much money I make? I think that it's just because I'm very analytical about things and I generally want to be logical about it."

And so, I often just try to establish good relations with them and learn what I can from them. Use them as a resource, which also helps build relationship. And that's, I would say because I recognize the value in building, a relationship with other people and learning from them because again, since they're a new team, It's a new team that I probably am not super familiar with it. So I want to make sure that I know everything that I can and the best resource are my teammates."

But I feel like that helps me get certain projects done and not give up on them. I guess you call it being persistent as well. But being stubborn can also mean, I put too much time into a certain project when it should just move past it. I think my biggest strength overall probably is. I get pretty, you're pretty dedicated to my job. I told her things I take pride in is my work ethic. Biggest weakness overall. Well, I'm good at working with people and asking questions, I'm not the best at always asking for help on certain projects. So if I don't understand something, I'll ask questions. But sometimes, if I'm overwhelmed, it's hard for me to ask for help and reach out. That's probably my biggest weakness."

Even, you know, if it's stressful or if it's hard, it doesn't really turn me away from doing anything. I'm pretty optimistic as well. I think my best friend would say that. Sometimes I kind of annoys them, but I'm generally pretty optimistic and have a positive outlook on most things. I do have a friend that once told me that I need to put the fact that I once rode my bike 40 miles a day to work, put on resumes some like I saw something I try to bring up to So I do. I'm a dedicated to my job. Optimistic. And strong other words, I think my friends would use"

There's a stressful job and sometimes lead. So we rewind towards the end of working. There we switch to appointment only. So you have to go online, make an appointment and you couldn't just show up fingerprints. And we had that on our doors with signs and said that on our website said that everything said that. But often you get people coming in while you're closing up shop, turn the lights off and everything, kind of money, and they would demand that you let them in and I had two, professional is tell them to make an appointment. Despite that, despite them offering me bribes. They do not attempt, they tell me I'll give you 50 bucks. If you let me know right now, I could have made extra money that way that might affect how they felt about our shop, but I feel like the professional thing to do then was to not let them walk all over me.Yes. Can I stick to what our Like how we functions tread stick to our rules and our guidelines. Now that people kind of take advantage of situations why? I think I did that is Again you know, I don't like people taking advantage of situations and I also wanted to make sure that we maintain the consistent response to our customers. So that means, you know we didn't get one person coming in on Monday that You know, was able to make it in, after hours, and then, on Wednesday, they're friendly. Told about that came in and I said, oh no, we're closed. So, I think consistency was important in the decision making"

I work with different teams, different places, almost every day, and whether it's like a kitchen crew and the college or like a stagehand crew at the theater, Or just groups of my clients that I haven't met yet. Usually, I always into those bro, friendly. Challenge for them. With, you know, showing up my confidence. So typically wouldn't I do that, I'm supporting one of my clients, helping them get a job or something like that. But I also make sure I try to make that. Connection and build that rapport with the team. You know, it's cool because I can force it but I do want to build and establish that relationship early. I think that they have a good team. Everyone needs to kind of be on the same page and they don't have to like each other but there's be able to be cordial and be friendly enough with each other. that's kind of why I go into those optimistic and friendly and walk the line between being professional and, you know, being candid, I think a lot of times people can focus too hard at being professional and when they do that, Things get too stuffy and it's not, you know, build those connections, if all you're focusing on his big professional. So thing having level of candidness when you enter a new team is also good."

I'm no stranger to that. I mean, I don't even respond negatively to it. You know, like I said before, I try to respond professionally but candidly Things can get pretty heated in my line of work to work with people disabilities. They can get annoyed sometimes with people. I'm reading it. Like any other situation is important, you had all your emotions, dictate how you're going to treat someone else, especially in the workplace. That's one. Where do you think of socialism? It's very important, maybe more so than candidness is when someone's pushing your buttons, you just got to roll with the punches and Kill em with kindness."

I don't want clutter, they can eventually start to frustrate me and not outwardly, but I'll just get kind of annoyed from the workplace or workspace is Disheveled but Java had in Portland, all the things in the office weren't mine and they didn't have a place to go. So I was stuck dealing with someone else's mess and I tried to organize his best. I could. But he just had too much crap, all around and It was annoying, but I tried to let it affect me too much. Yeah, it's not very critical of me at all. I tend to keep it pretty. Pretty organized workspace. I like working in misses, you know,"

So I think my best friend will describe me as a person with knowledge, with compassion and with honesty and trust, my friend can rely on me being completely open and honest with them. I they would describe me as a person without fear to confront difficulties problems and a person that is vulnerable and sharing their own opinions, but also strong enough to stand firm on their ground.

So when I before I join my current company, I had a couple other offers that hand that have different status, different position, and different benefit packages, different compensations. And first of all, I feel fortunate. Not that I care. I'm, I'm seen as hireable for multiple places Monta positions, but it comes with, when it comes to decision making, I focused more on how I whether identify with the mission and goals of the company of the that I'm working. I'm that I'm hired I would like to work for a company whose goal and Mission aligns with my personal goal."

And I know know, in hindsight, I know, I can do things while I can get along well with new people, but before I can prove myself to the snooker people, I tend to be more reserved. Yeah, that's why."

They're not follow behaving, they're not following the rules of the road. They're making other people dangerous and I felt a nice. I feel a little bit agitated irritated. When I see those bad drivers. I think it's because my personality is really rule-oriented, or I like things to be order. I like the rules to be followed and and, Yeah."

So, that would be my number one, strengths and weaknesses. Being a little bit, too helpful in taking a little bit too much on, but I always like to make sure that my team is good to go and I have no problem picking up other or helping others with their work. I'm not going to say picking it up completely, but those would be my easily my greatest strengths and weaknesses as an employee."

I am very, very Professional and do my best in those situations. Because the last thing that I want to do is bring down myself or my team. I would never want to affect anybody else's money. Like I'm okay with messing or I'm not okay with it, but I will always take personal responsibility for any way that I might mess up for myself. But I cannot handle messing something up and Having other people affected. And I believe that. I'm that way because I don't want anybody else to suffer for my mistakes.

I automatically ask anybody if they need anything. What can I do? I like to have personal conversations to get to know people without obviously, going over the line.

So we'll have a lot of Nations about pretty General things and I can learn a lot from a person just by, you know, just by talking to them.

Take a deep breath. Go to a different room if possible. But, you know, if not you try to think of the positives of the situation, you know, are they teaching you something? Is it something in? Or is it something in my own head that I can talk myself out of being annoyed? I try very hard to not get annoyed at things but I'm only human. So I think that I am that way because of children, I used to be a much less patient person, but now I am quite patient. And I've learned to take a step back and take some big deep breaths and just do my best to talk myself out of actually being annoyed. I'm pretty good at talking people out of being annoyed as well, to seeing yourself in the other person's shoes is also a a very good way to not be so annoyed at the situation."

And so generally, I would start off my my days by reorganizing everything that way, everything is super easy to find. I like to know where things are at all times. And I think That I am that way, simply because it makes work easier. It makes work of course a whole lot easier when ever, you know, exactly where everything is and everything, super easy to get to. I also grew up that way, my grandfather was a teacher and everything was very regimented and very everything. You know, everything has its place, so it kind of drives me crazy. Whenever all of my stuff is not Organized and I tend to strive to keep it in a more picked up manner."

It's a dangerous inside of a kitchen. People can be burned slip. I don't want anybody to get hurt. So I like a clean space and it keeps things moving in an orderly fashion.

So I could be thrown a new task that has been done before. And complete it and my persistence and my ability to learn allow me to do that my weakness. Great. Our greatest weakness would be that. I tend to procrastinate on some jobs. Not that I don't get them done, but maybe I will should wait. And I wait longer than I should to get started on something."

As thoughtful, caring intelligent someone who Likes to think of other people before themselves. Someone who Is very inquisitive who likes to know how things work? And understand them. Oh awesome."
63615a0d78c37e20f0739bd6_q3_c1_1674612468_15906318-9dfc-400c-8e3b-ac3346cc07c5,"A situation where a professional decision, could affect my status and how much money I make would be, obviously very stressful because obviously that sort of situation is affecting your career or my career in this case. And so I would feel pressure to perform to the best of my ability. And two. Do the best job that I could, but obviously, I can perform well under stress in some cases but some cases I can't. So it's a possibility that maybe I wouldn't perform as well or perform better. It's hard to say, Yeah. And just so in general, that's the stress of the situation, or the situation would cause stress so and may or may not cause me to form or worse."
63615a0d78c37e20f0739bd6_q4_c1_1674612541_15906318-9dfc-400c-8e3b-ac3346cc07c5,"So when I am joining a new team of people, I am usually someone anxious takes me a while to get comfortable around a new group of people new group of people. Not that I would be afraid to talk to them or anything as bad as that but I'm somewhat reserved around people I'm unfamiliar with and but I think when it comes to work and particular subjects, I'm Les. Reserve, a more reserved in a personal aspect and the reason why that is is just that, I guess you can call me an introvert. So just around new people. In general, I am somewhat reserved."
63615a0d78c37e20f0739bd6_q5_c1_1674612615_15906318-9dfc-400c-8e3b-ac3346cc07c5,"So in situations where people annoy me, if it's a professional setting, then I usually try to bottle it unless it's important that the whatever is annoying me. Be said sometimes if someone just annoys me and it's not the right time or place, then it's not the right exactly where. It's exactly that stand that right time or place. but if it affects the job, like, whatever is annoying me, we affect the job, then I may say something or are unlikely to say something and but in a way that is professional and will bring attention to the subject, And my personal life, I'm more likely to say something though."
63615a0d78c37e20f0739bd6_q6_c1_1674612703_15906318-9dfc-400c-8e3b-ac3346cc07c5,"So a disorganized workspace is not very typical of me to some people in some situations, it may seem disorganized but I think, even in most cases to other people will see them organized. And organize workspace is very important to me because like to know where everything is without having to think about it. I just want to go to my workspace and grab what I need and no words. That at all times and a disorganized workspace is very stressful for me because of the reason that sometimes you just can't find things and generally just a disorganized workspace. Makes me feel bad. Just having a clean workspace puts me in a better mood."

I'm somebody who puts a lot of time and effort into what they do and the tasks that they're assigned. Almost to a fault. Sometimes I may be work too hard on things and there are people who accept Less effort and just want to get things done. Where I'm somebody who does a consider about a considerable amount of job, considerable amount of time and effort into the job and weakness. Sometimes there are certain situations where I feel like I want my opinion to be heard and if the person in charge does not want to hear, that necessarily doesn't really regard my opinion. Sometimes I lose value or at least lose their perception of my value. And so it's something that I take to heart and sometimes that isn't necessarily a positive thing. Sometimes you just got to kind of go with the flow and so typically, I'm somebody who is a good team player. Somebody who works together to achieve a task. Well, with others, I can be I can delegate jobs if I'm in position of Delegation but I also can take the job that I was given and go with that flow."
63615e6f289af113029ab58b_q2_c1_1671740018_44ef9131-278e-4ab6-9353-132628b56dab,"I would say my best friend would describe me as somebody who is pretty loyal and considerate, I their Thing Called Love Languages, I'm definitely not somebody who's good at giving gifts or even receiving them sometimes but I'm somebody who always tries to put other people's feelings first and I can put their their lens on my view and understand their perspective. So I'm somebody who I think would be described as generally very empathetic, Dick and understanding somebody who's loyal and committed, somebody who can can can be there when they're needed, but also understand that sometimes are not always needed, and don't always need to be heard, which is sometimes felt or, you know, be present in people's feelings. So, I would say the overall, I'm somebody, who I think most people would want to be friends with, or at least want to have someone who possesses my characteristics to to be In their friend grouping. And somebody, you know, I'm pretty fun and pretty easy going and go with the flow. If there's a situation where like, hey let's let's jump in the car and drive to this place and do this thing randomly spontaneously. I'm usually pretty cool with that."

I have a salary and I mean, education, so pretty much. I guess what I do daily is every day, I make decisions that affect my, my salary, which is either having a salary or not. There's a lot of preparation that goes into it. And I, you know, I behaved as somebody who's a professional and somebody who takes again, their Session very seriously. Even doesn't matter who's watching her, who's getting the education from me? It's something that I take very seriously and preparedness and practice, and thoroughness are all things that I generally take very seriously. And it is something where I take a lot of pride in what I do, and how I'm associated with various tasks that I'm given, especially ones, that would affect my status and would affect my salary because we don't like to say, we do jobs for the money, but Sometimes we just do because it's sometimes we want to live and to do that, we need money. But overall I would say very professional and things that would affect my status and salary."
63615e6f289af113029ab58b_q4_c1_1671740217_44ef9131-278e-4ab6-9353-132628b56dab,"So I think overall, when I enter a new team so I played Sports my whole life and all those Sports having to be team sports and so you play a role. And if you're new to that team, whether it's on a sports team or it's a professional team, everyone has their role. Everyone has their strengths, and everyone has their weaknesses. And sometimes Individuals don't know their strengths their weaknesses or they think they have a strength. When it might not be, they think they have a weakness. When it might not be some people are very hyper critical of themselves and so being a new member to a team, you kind of have to sit back and take in what the group dynamic is and what the team Dynamic is, and the overall goal of what the team is trying to accomplish. Because sometimes, when we're apart of a team, we feel like we want to say something we want to play a role that is already. Filled already been said and so if you're new and you're just trying to kind of fit in and get your feet wet with whatever is happening, you kind of sit in and see where the dynamic goes."
63615e6f289af113029ab58b_q5_c1_1671740329_44ef9131-278e-4ab6-9353-132628b56dab,"So, this happens more often than I care to admit, but overall I think I react wear depends on the situation. If I feel like there's a person that annoys me and there could be blowback, or they have a position of authority over me, or somehow they'll be a negative thing in the future. If I do say, how I really feel about the person of a situation or that, how they're making you feel. You'll usually I can just go and let it slide or not focus on it and focus on something else. And usually my effort in whatever is happening becomes minimal, or I kind of check out mentally, if it's in a position where I don't have somebody of authority over me or there would be blowback. I generally let the person know what they're doing overall. Like I just play Pickleball and that played today, and this guy played with, we were doing some specific. Stacking moves and he was kind of mansplaining to me about the stuff and he kept saying the thing over and over, I made a bad shot call and I knew it the moment that I put the paddle out there and he kept saying, oh, that's a forehand shot, that's a forehand and I was like, I get it. I understand you don't have to keep repeating yourself and that's literally what I said. And, you know, some kind of sometimes it gets a little snippy. I could be a little snippy, but it's usually when there's a point where I've taken the maximum amount of whatever is happening that I can't, Take."
63615e6f289af113029ab58b_q6_c1_1671740434_44ef9131-278e-4ab6-9353-132628b56dab,"I would say, overall, my workspace is not disorganized at all. It's usually very organized and if there's a situation where it does happen to be not very organized as the question States. It's usually because I'm in the middle of doing something and then organization is Or lack of perceived organization is actually more organized than it may seem. I don't like things in different spots where they're not supposed to be, and I have a place for everything and everything has its place as the old adage goes. And so, I would say if there's a reason why it's usually, because I'm being pulled in five different directions, that I have had a chance to reorganize, but most times things are put in the place where I perceive them to be necessary or to be the most efficient overall. all, and Again, if there is something where it's not that case, it would be pretty high, stress level. I will say, though, overall workspace is very organized. My desktop might not be or where I put files might not be like logical. I do have a tendency to try to beat hyper-organized, especially with digital files, and it doesn't always work out. Sometimes, sometimes got to put things in one big place and say, here it is."

All different kinds of personalities cultures. I don't judge people, I accept people for who they are. Me, personally, I generally tend to keep to myself a little bit more more reserved person, but at the same time, I know when I need to speak up. Up and get my point across. So I'm able to analyze things really well and report them to people. I'm very I'm very noticeable of a lot of different things and I tend to notice things that other people don't. So I'm very observant, very logical and I like to work with pretty much anybody. And as far as weaknesses I can't end I tend to be a little bit shy and maybe sometimes that prevents me from, you know, getting as much done with other people because I'm afraid of interaction. And then, apart from that, I tend to be a perfectionist. So I might spend more time. Focused on one thing and then it takes longer than I should. So when I do my work do it. I tend to do very quality work and don't make a lot of mistakes, but I definitely could improve speed wise."

And I, I'm a very trustworthy person. I mean, what I say, I call a spade, a spade and, you know, I'm not afraid to hold my friends accountable either. If I see them doing something that they shouldn't be. But apart from that, I think they'd say I'm, I'm funnier than a lot of people would realize, I have a couple different sides to me. I am quiet, I'm sure they would say that. But I'm also kind of secretly funny aside from that. I think they would just say that. I'm a generally just a good person and I actually want the good for them to I'm not as selfish as I feel like a lot of people are nowadays. I genuinely will celebrate my friends successes and be. There with them when they need me the most I never want to come across as someone who, you know, puts my needs before theirs. And I only care about myself. So you know, in summary they'd say I'm a caring person a kind person and I'm very dependable."

I haven't been in too many situations where I make big decisions that affect, you know, my status or how much money I make. But I will say I did recently get a promotion at my job and I made the choice. No one really made me do it so I wasn't really forced into it but I picked up a bunch of overtime hours. We have a rush usually before. The holidays at the place I work. And we were really short staffed, so I took a lot of the hours even though I was still in school and I ended up getting promoted to like a more of a managerial position. So now as for like two weeks ago, I make a little bit more money and I guess it affects my status within the company a little bit because I'm now a manager and I'm viewed as a little bit. As having more Authority, I guess. But you know I anticipate as I go up in this company. If I stay here, if I move on to a new company, I will hopefully embody more positions where I actually have to make some of these decisions important decisions that affect me or even an entire company company. Hopefully one day but Yeah, that's pretty much the only one. That's really affected. How much money? I make not really status, but just kind of I guess how people feel me."

I started working when I was 16 and now I'm 20, and I've only been a part of two different companies and May 24th, I started at of this year, I started at my new job. So, it was sad to say, goodbye to my old old friends at my other place, but yeah, I had to join this new team of people and I just because of my personality and My anxiety. I tend to not feel comfortable right away and it takes me a while to get used to new situations and new people. But like I said, I'm adaptable and I make it work even though it's not I'm not it's not natural for me to go up to people and make friends or like I said be the new guy and have to ask a bunch of questions. I don't like it. I don't like being in a position where I don't know the answer to something or I'm the one that has to be Dependent on someone else to learn how to do my work. So, I usually behave I try to absorb as much information as I can, but I'm a little reserved little shy because of my personality. But now I'm at the point where I'm comfortable going to work, I've made a lot of new friends. I know pretty much everybody there and I know it's good for me at the end of the day. I don't like joining new teams of people but if I'm going to advance my career and Move up the ladder. I know it's something. I'm going to have to do."

I like things to be a certain way and I like them too and if they don't go the way, I'm expecting them to and someone else is the reason for that. I tend to get really frustrated and want to do things my way instead of, you know, their way. But so I am very particular and so, a lot of things annoy me. I think I get annoyed especially at work more than most people do. But I usually react I don't usually react as the thing because I'm I don't like confrontation. I'm not a, I'm not a person that likes to go up and just yell at somebody or just even Front them at all. I usually just kind of stick to my own plan. I don't really address it. There have been times when I have addressed it and then my last place, I actually had to go report somebody because of something really bad to happen. But the different, the day-to-day things, you know, that annoying you, I think I just have learned to roll with it. And, you know, it's part of being of a company. If you're not an entrepreneur, you know, you, you have to abide by it, you know, the leaders rules and they've obviously chosen to hire certain people for a reason to use have to trust the process."

The last place I left was actually I'd say pretty organized compared to most places but when I first started working I like I went to my first day and I came back and I'm like, I don't know how anything gets done like everything so unorganized and I don't know where anything is and part of me just, you know, discovered That's how you feel at a new job. And then other times I had to realize I had to tell myself, you know what, you're a perfectionist, you know things get done, it might not be as organized and perfect as you feel, it should be. But You know, I realized that I just have to learn to roll with it and what I view is organized might not be as bad as what most people would think and at the end of the day, if you're getting the task done it's fine. And you know the place I'm at now is definitely more organized than my first or less organized. Sorry they my first place but it's forced me to have to speak up and ask questions. And there were a couple times when I Something to my leader and they made a change and I thought it was for the better and I thought we began to flow better as a company at least in whole company, but my little section and you know, it helps with organization, the things I brought up. So I think You know, I have to learn to be more flexible but at the same time, if there is something I've always been one to address it for the good of the company."

I usually when somebody annoys me, I just tried to blow it off and less, it's having a impact on getting the work done. That needs to be done. I feel like everybody can have bad days and or it maybe if I'm getting annoyed that I'm having a bad day, if it is causing a problem in the workplace, then I'll typically try to Talk with that person, one-on-one to figure out what's going on and what needs to be done about it.

I'm curious my weakness, I guess I don't stop talking because I keep asking questions even is after the question is answered, I'm spontaneous. Things that pop into my head, I'll ask. Questions, related or unrelated, even if we're working, I'll think of several things at one time. but, you know, if someone gives me, I am working contract and they throw me into a, okay, I'm a medical assistant and they throw me. I work on track. That means I go from assignment to assignment to different places, different Hospital, medical, clinical settings, excuse me, they take me and I have to learn a whole new system clinical Software System, and oh, yeah. And smoke. And I have to learn a new one called Athena. You don't really get a, you get a quick. Short introduction on how to turn it on, set up your password. And the parts didn't want you to fill out but the rest of it the trainings on the fly. So on our down time excuse me what I do is I ask questions and I bother people I bother everybody and the one way I can get them to respond to help me is the one doctor knows epic like I do, which is commonly used in the bigger hospitals so she goes, oh yeah, I miss that. Or I like that. Or this is similar to this. Yeah. So then when we then I get a better idea or I just follow the other medical assistant and go. Hey how do you do this? Is that the same as going that an epic. So you know and then I would ask questions like how to improve it. Like if we can just find a list of all the patients that need to do this, can we put a search in and we're able to, but she doesn't know how and I don't want to put her down I just let her give me the answer and then I go on my own because they have a search menu. Oh, I need to stop. Okay. So then they have a search menu and I go on there and I find out. So"

My first job out of college and I didn't want to work there because everyone that you had to work for. Well, not everybody. Affected how much money I could have made. I could have made a lot of money, but it was the fact that I was not married and there's a lot of dirty old men and the only way to get up in their place was too to sleep around. And the same married people that are still sleeping with each other. 20 years later are still doing that, which is appalling because either you should or get off the pot and they could have been together. If you're going to do this for 20 years, do your partner's a favor shit or get off the pot but they didn't so their life is still I'm not I don't stink up the I havin and that was a professional decision that I made.

So I imagine everyone in their underwear. That good old-fashioned trick. They always taught us and I couldn't shut up because when I get nervous, I keep talking and I keep repeating the same question. Now you, how are you? How are you? How, how are you even if I saw him two seconds? Pata go. Passing by me. So I guess I still act that way. It just depends. I don't know. I get her. Well, I do so, um, yeah. I think it's interesting. You could tell which people are welcoming friendly, which are fake, which are phony and which are just there to get through the day and make money. So I just focus on what I need to do and, you know, go from there and sometimes I'll just sit there and yeah, that's the question, how do you usually behave? There you go. Kind of like on the video. My attention goes away. I don't Focus because I focus on the wrong things, instead of trying to do the job or like, who's going to do what? Or, you know, and I think the best approach is just to sit back, be laid back. Let them see if you see the first word. Like, if there's a room of people and nobody wants to talk to me, I just sit back. I'm getting paid to be there anyway. And I'll just stay quiet all day doing my thing, which I know that I can do or know how to do or do nothing. Go for me room. And don't be sorry. That's who we are. Like I said, I'll just sit in a room full of people and I won't say anything. I'll just sit back until they say something."

I think I said, yeah, I was annoyed because someone a co-worker Huh. No, it's interview, question, stop think of situations when someone annoyed you. Okay, I was at work and the only person I had was one boss, the lead. I'm a medical assistant and Basically when she was gone on vacation, I was the only one there me and the doctor and it was just me and the doctor do decide what to do or actually the doctor you have to ask, you know, hey I got a question you know, and that's how it is in the field. There's a lot of situations and the patient's never annoyed me. It was the receptionist which I did a really when someone annoys me, I ignore them. I ignore him as best as I can. And I did pretty good and the easy way to do that, was she sat in the front office and thank God. There was a door there, I could hear her because there were walls, which was a really stupid layout in a bank. There were walls, which you can hear people in noises and talking, but I didn't have to see her. I could just turn my back on my ass on her and just focus on my work and I had people coming up to me other clinicians in the off in the building that were sitting. Saying, you know, the only person that she thinks she's the boss of you, and sounds like, we're two years old and it's a bunch of women in their 50s and 60s working. And I was like, why not, what are you talking about? Because I had done such a great job of keeping our Earth, back of my mind or wiping her out. Like, I'm just saying myself in my mind, wipe out this tape, wipe it out and forget about it, and that's easy. But the hard part, was they kept coming up to remind me about it and I'm like, I It already I'm good. What, what did you say? And they're like, well she's this and she's, I don't care, I don't want to talk about it. So the good part was I always have HR that I can go to and I always say my mind. Well, I could go to HR which HR the contract did employee agency or the actual company I'm working for, oh, look to eat, HRS to go to awesome. But basically, I stick to myself and I focus on my job and it doesn't really get me down and Because in a couple weeks I'll be going to a new assignment. So that's the beauty of it.

I take them that's very distracting for me. I'm real visual person and I'll get distracted easily. So, I take them, I turn them over and I put them in a corner or in a drawer. I will get back to them later. I have to have a clean workspace basically if there is a ton of papers I'll just get up find a counter or online. An empty, patient room with a chair and desk and I'll work in there. Get ready for the getting ready, for the next patient or the next procedure or whatever. I have to do, if I have a phone call, I'll take the portable phone with me in a different room talking to patients and and not get distracted. If there's a lot of noise, a lot of people talking over me, patients and staff. Like I said, I'll take the portable, or I'll take the other phone with the line. Drag it into the first room, close the door. And also I can pray to keep patients private, I get distracted, my eyes, my hearing not to mention privacy had before the patient and everything else and the computer so it's a lot easier that way. I don't I make sure that I have my supplies on me. You know my stethoscope some pad of paper, a few pens and a couple other, you know scissors, paper injections, whatever I need wherever I'm going and I'll make sure to have it on hand all day to get ready for the next day. I'll take whatever I'll print out whatever I need Have the supplies ready? Get ready for the next day? Check double-check that. These are the patients that are coming for that day. Get the paperwork ready. Organize it we all know to look to put it on a counter, in to go there, to look for it. We all know where to find what, but like I said at my station, if I don't have one or if it's super duper dirty, I will just shove everything into a drawer cabinet. And work because you have to be focused and you have to keep track of time. You have to be organized, right? You have to prioritize constantly and you have to be flexible."

That said I'm a little bit stubborn when it comes to asking people for help. So another one of my weaknesses is something green. I think that means my audio is working. Okay, all right, I'm going to assume my audio is working. Sorry, Generally, I would say that my greatest strength is also my greatest weakness. It is that I am stubborn when it comes to solving a problem. I've been assigned, I will work on it until it is done.

But I also consider my time as an important factor in the past, I've taken on projects, which in my line of work, it's salary. We're not clock and clock out. So, if you works, It's two hours, you still get paid, like you're working 40 hours or whatever the average, you know, they expect, you know what I mean? If Cutta Cutta salary into 365 days out of the year and, you know, so on, but that's not worth it to me. I mean, you could say that there's some sense of accomplishment that comes with, oh yes, I accomplished 60 hours worth of stuff this week. That's not really what it translates to you. Anyway, my time is important. That said, I also respect the company That the company's time is important. So if I can create a benefit by working 45 hours instead of 40 hours a week, I'll tell typically do it. I would like some additional compensation. But I mean I'm not going to say no, I'm not going to say, hey, it's no. I want to go for something like that. When I could save a lot of people a lot of trouble or money. Anyway, as far as me just saying that money is I'm at a point where I'm comfortable, I won't turn down more money if it doesn't really throw too much of a wrench in my day-to-day activities, but my time is valuable. So, it's time and money. Behavior wise, I will act in the interest of the group more often than not. I know I'm getting kind of analytical right now, that's because I'm a little bit nervous, and I haven't again done an interview in a while. But anyway, yeah, just a I'm Lucid. I'm a lucid person. It's not just oh, I can make 10,000 more dollars doing all this. Well, great. But I am making a comfortable amount of money right now. I'm not a grind set person. I think that normalizing extreme grind. And then rest periods is not healthy. I think work and a healthy life balance, should be more evenly. Distributed people gamifying Mima fi the grind to sort make it more palatable, but I No, that that's not acceptable. Um anyway so yeah. Hope 10 seconds. I'll be directed. Okay.

When it comes to interacting with people, I don't think I don't go into conversations thinking that I'm running into a mustache, twirling villain or a crazy person or you know, I don't think at worst people are going to be awkward at worst. I'm going to be awkward and that's okay. So absolutely I'm optimistic going into new situations with new people. and I think that's, because Typically crazy, people are in movies and they exist. They're real evil is out there in the world crazies out there in the world. This general not good. Is out there in the world but like I the most difficult person that I have ever worked with is my girlfriend who I am with all the time.

Basically I will stomach whatever. Comfort. This annoying person is this annoyance and then just make moves to avoid them in the future because honestly it's not just a confrontational avoidance. I just don't think it's worth being confrontational about annoyance. That's not a sin. And personally I think just Thing. There are things. I like that annoy other people and there are things that annoy me that other people. Like I don't think I'm in a position to it's like a lot of people It's like a lot of people saying you don't have the say and who lives and who dies? I think less extreme. I think you don't have a say in what is actually annoying. I'm okay, there are some extremes but very rarely rarely. Do you deal with that? You get into the conversation with someone talks about boats for a little bit longer than you a little bit more passionately and length Ali than you want to talk about boats, you know, No. So I just don't think I don't think it's worth making someone feel bad saying that they're annoying or making it obvious there. Anyway, I think it's worth doing what you can to sort of issue yourself from the conversation and avoid those annoying topics in the future. Unless it becomes a recurring issue, like they seek you out, and then it's just like, wearing down in your psyche. And then it's like, okay, for the low low price of letting them know that you don't want to talk. You can avoid hardship on both your ends both hardship on the end of them. When you snap one day and both the hardship you and or up until that point."

I work on the computer a lot, so I'll have like five File Explorer windows open, maybe two terminals. A bunch of wet towels or one web browser with a bunch of questions in it and one like my development environment and another screen and stuff. Like I will take up as much space as I want to without thinking about it. While I'm focused on the task until maybe it gets to a point where I have to clean things up or they're all getting in the way. Once I am done, then I will clean it all up. So I, I don't get anal about organization when it's not important. And there's one thing that anyway, that's not have not getting into a rant, anyway. I think it's because I focus on what needs to be done. Like, in terms of like to certain urgency, I very quickly and some not subliminally. What's, what is the word subconsciously? Categorize and like figure out, okay, like what's worth this amount of time and effort right? Or what needs to be done, how much concentration does it take? And I sort of Yeah, cleaning up the workspace as long as it's not. Impeding me. Never really gets very high on that list.

If I had a weakness, if you could say there's such a thing, I might argue that. I'm Too truthful. And so in that regard I would need to eat more tactful and diplomatic. And what I say what I'm offering is honest constructive advice. I'm not trying to tear anybody down.

Most people would think it was kind of crazy going into it setting the expectation that they didn't have to pay me more but I like to be honest and I met a place financially and in my life in general where I don't have to earn what I used to need and I like to do the job that I do, because I enjoy it more. So now I'm thankful to be in that position and because I am and I knew that it was a smaller Boutique type company. I was honest with him, told him what I needed and they, of course, meant that plus a little and I think that they appreciated the the honesty and integrity in that the thought, - behind it. I hope they did and I continue to have a great career with the company and great personal relationships with the people that I work with there.

But here lately thankfully, it's been by email or phone call and I'm able to have an expression or an exhale, that maybe it's not witnessed by the the individual delivering the behavior that's annoying. So that's been a good thing. But in general, I try To respond to what's going on rather than the individual and rather than the energy that they're bringing. I want to acknowledge where they're coming from and why they feel the way they do, without giving credence to the behavior without giving credence to the comments that are inappropriate, those things are addressed as a matter of coaching or correcting. But from the perspective of achieving a business objective. Look at The Meta message.

So you learn to put that aside, you learn to act professional, you learn to set your personal stuff, all by aside because your goal is to do X, Y and Z. And when you work as a team you learn how to temper those reactions. I think it's just comes down to professionalism."

My workspace generally is appears rather disorganized to other people, to me, it is perfectly organized and I understand where everything is. There are several studies out there that show that people have exceptional intelligence, think more creatively when there is chaos around them. Because chaos encourages chaos, which is different lines of thinking which makes four UniQue Ideas, so it's pretty Typical of me to have a messy, what other people would describe as a messy or disorganized desk.

You know, when a customer needs help or client, I come over to them. I ask them what they need, how can I help them? And I don't stop helping them until they are satisfied until they got the answers that they are looking for. But but on the other half of that is my weakness because I'm still focused one that particular client that particular customer. I will not stop until they're satisfied. However, there may be other people waiting and other people are standing there. Like, when she going to come to me, I need help. I could see that they're short-staffed. Here. But come on lady, hurry it up. So, that's my one big weakness. I need to allot more time to each and every customer and not just be.

See me because she's not the only person that has told me that I give of my time. I give apparently Sage advice. I honestly don't know that. I'm doing it.

I was going to go to a completely different state about four states away. Take that job. Unfortunately, I couldn't, I Got sick. However, it was my, I don't know. It was how I handled myself with clients that the corporate office decided that they wanted me in their corporate office and not just at the branch office where I had worked for years. They wanted me to come to the head office to work with their customers, with their clients, I have the personality, they were looking for I wasn't just about a paycheck and just checking boxes and just doing my job and getting out of there and doing my nine-to-five know.

I listened intently to what they have to say. I asked the appropriate questions. I even asked to pitch right in to see how well I would do with certain. Certain clients. If I first of all I listened like on a headset to what they were saying at the time. And I also took copious notes just to make sure that I understood and I ask the appropriate questions and then I asked before they even said oh you're going to take the next call or you're going to talk with the next client. I asked ahead of time. I make sure that I jumped right in and said, hey Can I do this? Can I, can I take the next client if you can, you know, tell me if I'm doing something wrong, you'll have to take over or something, but I really want to do the Hands-On learning because that's how you learn. You don't learn. Very well, why should say you don't learn as well until you do the Hands-On learning. That's always been my experience and I loved doing that sort of thing.

The situation where someone annoyed me now, I don't know if you mean, When someone annoyed me at work, which was, I can think of a particular incident of when a supervisor a newly made supervisor annoyed me and of course I just, you know, I had to be very diplomatic about it and I couldn't really tell her what I was feeling because she is now my boss, she is no longer one of us but, you know, I made my point, I made my objection. Ins and I did it in a very diplomatic type way. Well, here's what I feel and here's what I heard, here's what I heard you say. And here is my response to that. And you know is there some type of a the conclusion that we can come to or an agreement? Or are we going to have to agree to disagree? Or am I going to have to do it this certain way? Till I find that the way that I want to do, it works for me. I will do it your way, but I can tell you, I've been doing it a certain way and it's always worked. I had to be very diplomatic about it. So yeah, this person thought they knew best simply because they simply became a supervisor and They were just trying to usurp their Authority because this is their brand new title now.

So, so when that happens, I just had to organize it better and work a little faster but sometimes you can't because There are files that are yay, thick and you have to take the time to go through that, but basically, I kept my place pretty neat. I made sure I organized by category by an alphabetized that helped a lot. That way I can just reach into a pile. Get my hands on certain things. I know what pie It's going to be an, I know what category it's going to be in. I can reach it, very easily. I don't have things all over my desk, like some people, but I knew exactly what I was doing when I was doing it and how to do it."

You don't really think about the potential monetary gain that you're going to receive. If you're if you are truly a professional, I mean, does a doctor, think about a libel lawsuit when he's performing an operation know he focuses on the patient and trying to achieve the goal of the operation and Pretty much. That's the same as any professional. If you are truly a professional, you're going to try to achieve the best outcome, you know, for the job that you're doing.

And I would say this is a strength and a weakness to a fault and Say that because I I'd rather be honest with myself and with my employer it's easier to make mistakes in. Bring them to my employer right away, it allows me to learn things and learn my mistakes quicker and it also brings things to my employers attention quicker and it allows us both to find a result or an answer or or the next move forward. So you know, it's It's easier to. well, I don't think it's easier to be honest in this dishonest, but for me, I like being honest. Sometimes it can show weakness."

Eight-hour workday. but there's more jobs coming forward, that require your attention in a time and you're expected to oversee what or train and Overlook what other Jobs are getting John and your department. and, I've made professional decisions to be more honest about how much work can actually get done. Rather than just stating. Just putting out the numbers and saying, everything is getting done. And I think being more honest about the amount of time that we need, in the department versus How honest I was has made. Has definitely made an effect on how much money I think."

And I go to a lot of new positions in situations where I like to position myself in a place where there are things and people who know things that I don't know, and it allows people who could learn more and it's, it makes things more exciting.

I'm always on the go always wanting to set an example for my employees wanting to be a leader, not just a boss, some that sometimes that becomes a weakness in that my Employees think of me more, as a friend and stead of a boss because I want to create a sense of family within my team, I want them to be able to come to me with their issues. I want my my crew to think of me as someone that they can come too. And so that's that's that's where I really, really want to shine. That's what I want my people to.

That I want my crew to be happy with their employment because I know that happy workers make for good workers and they're easier to train, they're easier to work with the turnover is not as great.

A situation that made where I made a professional decision that would affect my status or how much money I made. Something that sticks out I used to run convenience stores out on the east coast and we had a blizzard one year out in Baltimore and my little store. I ended up staying in a hotel and getting driven back and forth to work by the police so that I could keep my little store open. It was the only store in the suburb that that the store was in that, that was open. So, We were the only ones servicing all the police officers. The fire trucks, the electric companies that were out the plow drivers. Anyone that was out in this storm. We were the only ones there available for him to feed them because we had a full Deli, and we serve fried chicken and, and of course, coffee hot chocolate. All that other goodies, anything convenience store would have and, So it was my professional decision to keep the store open one. It was my decision to Overstock my freezer and my refrigerator with chicken far more than my manage. Then my supervisor thought was proper, he was very concerned that I was going to have a lot of spoilage and I didn't I did not have any spoilers. Voyage because we sold it all. And I ended up making a whole lot of money in bonus because I did stay open. And because I did sell all that chicken and sold all that coffee. And on top of it, the service that was supposed to plow my drive, my parking lot, they never showed up. So one of the locals that did plowing came through to get coffee and I made a deal with him that he could have as much coffee as he wanted. If he just plowed my lat So, yeah, made money. It was great."

I want to know the Dynamics of who I'm working with. I don't want to come in and shake things up, especially if it's an established team. I really want to know who the people are, but I'm working with and see where I'm going to fit in all of that. I, I tend to take a leadership role automatically, it's just my personality and that can be off-putting to a lot of people especially to an established team. So it's in my best interest to kind of lay low and observe and see what's going on in the team and what I can offer and how I can offer that to them. It's just it, it's better for the team as a whole, if I don't just go roaring in."

I believe in killing people with kindness because I've worked retail, most of my life. So that's the way that you have to deal with people, otherwise, you risk losing customers and you don't want to lose a customer base, you know, I was always taught that when you please a customer, you please a customer. And when you This, please the customer that customers tells 10 other people, and you've lost that business. So when someone annoys me at work, I just try to be as kind as I can. Now, if to coworker, I'll take him to the side and we have to work it out because I can't work with someone and I'm annoyed with that. Just doesn't work at all. So we'll have to work through it."

I've had to come in and take the office apartment and take the office apart and then we organize it. I think that goes to just wanting to know where things are in my own place, my own space, so It's very typical of me to think that a place is very disorganized. Even though, for the last manager, it might not have been for me. It is because it just it needs to work for me. It needs those those places of organization and where things go has to work for me and everybody's different, everybody's got their own places to put things and it just that's that's all there is to it. That's how it works."

I work easily with people and I love Tech anything, any new programs that different companies might offer or things like that. I typically are am able to learn very quickly and then also teach others how to use them as well. My weaknesses are sometimes I prefer to work more alone. I like to figure things out and it takes me a minute to process sometimes and if I can just spend a few minutes alone, especially with learning something new or technology, I can usually figure it out. I do tend to ask a lot of questions in the beginning. Once I have it in my head that I understand exactly what I'm doing, then I am pretty self-sufficient. I typically don't need a lot of Direction. Once you point me in the right direction and I understand where to go and what is expected of me."

I think they would describe me as adventurous and fun, and loyal, and compassionate, and caring and helpful. When we do things together, I tend not to take the lead on some projects because there's always that person who needs to fill in the gaps. Many times I find in some of these things, there's too many leaders and not enough helpers. So I kind of of lay back and let all the a type personalities do it. They're going to do in, squabble it out and then I just go in and I fell and I get the job done honestly, so loyal compassionate adventurous. Little crazy. Sometimes spontaneous a good worker, a good friend. They would also know me in that capacity. Again, loyal compassionate, I tend to like to work for the same company for a long I'm the current company, I meant I've been there for 14 years and I really enjoy that knowing of the job. I know it is dealing with anybody I think. And I really think that that also is an asset to people and so I tend to stick with things and people probably a little longer than I should because I think that there's good in everybody and I am designed to find that good in people and And I guess that's it. But yeah that's how they would describe me fun, loyal adventurous and caring."

How I would have handled things years ago is different than how I would have handled them. Now, when I was raving, raising my family, I was a single mom and I had to make a lot of decisions that may not have been the best for me professionally or with how much money I make as I got older and my kids grew up. I didn't have to worry about them so much so I was able to make decisions based on How I felt about something right now. I'm in the process of making a decision because at the coolness, I guess that's a good word. My company has changed and I am not so sure that we're on the same page about goals and ethical honest, and things like that. So I'm really having a struggle with that. I know that it could definitely affect my professional decision as well as how much money I make. That is a big course but as I have matured, I guess I'm able to make decisions Are based more on ethical nastas and honesty and compassion instead of feeling that I have to do something. This is probably not a good answer. But having to do something that maybe I don't feel real comfortable with doing. And I I appreciate that. And I recognize that and I am blessed that, that is the position. I'm in my life right now."

I focus on learning the job and I kind of laid back a little bit. I don't want to come on, you know, like a crazy person trying to take over and make all these changes. I just kind of observe and I watch probably for a few weeks and then I make decisions based on what I see and I may try and implement or talk about those things that I see. I think it's always good to have an outsider come in and kind of look at it from a different perspective to see where things could be changed your processes. Could be done a little better and then I will let people know if they ask what I think. Why do I think that is? I think that is because I have had situations in the past where people have come in and tried to implement changes very quickly and it tends to upset the group or the team. And if you do things slowly, after you've watched and observed, I think it's better for the that old team. It's not as intimidating, and it allows you to be accepted faster, I think by the team as well once you've looked and you've made informed Intelligent Decisions instead of just coming in and trying to take over"

Some things are just small annoyances where you can actually brush them off or Overlook them or laughs them off. It's a small annoyance for a larger annoyance. I tend to step back again and review the situation before I go and speak my opinion. Usually and generally, I am like that. At the bigger, the annoyance, the bigger, the more control I need to take to step back and just gain control. So that I know I use the white right words and I handle the situation properly. Why do I think that is? I have learned that over time, it's not the way I always was, I generally were typically tended to be a little bit less. What's the word? Patient in the past. And I've learned that when you step back and you approach a situation again in an intelligent and compassionate way, you tend to get better results than if you do if you just fly off the handle and start screaming and yelling, not that I ever did that. But I was, I tended to be a little bit more like that when I was younger. But as I've gotten older, I've learned to just step back review. Figure things out. Figure out what my feelings are and find the best way to handle it before. I make a rash decision, or say something that I might not want to say that I definitely would have regret later."

Whether it's on my computer, or in a desk or in a file, I need to know where everything is so that I can find it quickly. I am in a sales position right now. I'm finding things quickly and knowing your way around and knowing how to help the customer with in the best way possible and is short of a time as possible so that you're not wasting their time or yours is very, very important to me. I think I am that way because again, it's important as a customer-centric person, you don't want to waste their time, you don't want to waste your time. It also helps you to look very, which I am confident when, you know, your way around. Instead of going over here, for something in over here for something. Or you can't find something not that. I know all the answers, and sometimes I have to look for an answer or something, and I will let a customer know, hey, luck. I want to get you an answer at whoops, I'll get you an answer in a certain amount of time, and I always give them what that time is and I get back to them in that amount of time. And again, I think that that makes you helps you to look more confident like you know what you're doing because especially in sales, they want to know that they're working with someone. You can help them with their problem, effectively, without spending more money than they need to sometimes. And again just that compassionately that you understand. They're talking about."

And yet only have one or two that are working to their Highest Potential. So I would expect the same amount of effort and output from the others that I put forth myself, which is a lot of times my greatest weakness because I have high expectations of the other employees.

I think I've actually lost money in that respect, because of, I don't know whether it's nepotism or however, the interaction was between the other employee and, and higher-ups they did not take my Integrity into account as far as me offering up the information that the other employee had in their name, but they just ran with the Other employee suggestions and eliminated me from the lube altogether and that other employee ended up not having as much Integrity as myself and cut me out of the loop that's causing me to lose my position and the financial benefits of that position in the company."

Hey, what do you think about this? How do you handle this? What do you do when the situation comes up? I think the biggest thing to do when you join a new group or a new team is to listen, learn ask questions and try to accumulate as much information. As you can and I think that's what's going to make you ultimately successful. If you're joining a new team of people, these are people that are already doing it and you need to figure out what makes them successful.

And so, you know, I explained to the gentlemen, here's the situation here is what the rules are here is our policy. Here's what we're allowed to do. Here's what we're not allowed to do and you kept wanting to argue. And was telling me that I was wrong, that he knew more, about my, my policies and my procedures at my job than I did. And as somebody who doesn't even work for the agency, it was a little frustrating. Well, ultimately, I explained to the gentleman. I would verify the information I was giving him. I got his information and told him, I would contact him back and I politely ended the phone call. Letting him know I would get back with him.

When we were short-handed, it was a situation where my assistant was was unavailable for extended period of time, we were short staff, and our office staff. And it was a situation where I was really holding down more than one position and trying my best Best to be successful at handling multiple positions, and that's definitely not typical with me. I believe in being very organized, it helps me keep my flow going. What needs to be done? Setting priorities. If you're not organized, I'm not sure how you would set the priorities to make sure the most important things get done. And then the mid important things and then the Important things. So I think in a general sense I might actually a very organized person. I have my priorities each day that I set out what has to get done today, what I'll do with free time and then you know those extras that you slip in when you have an extra 30 minutes at the end of the day.

I am the type who will continue to press on until I can get through. Whatever is in my path. That's a also I'm just generally Very organized person, I will. When I approach a task, you know, I'm the type who will formulate a plan first before just launching straight into action.

And when it's time to do a little Research and dig in on my own as far as my weaknesses go. I would say that. At times, I can be. Over critical of myself, I think for my strengths you seen you I've pretty high standards and also, I'm a pretty high achiever. And so when I do for example, run into some spot of adversity, sometimes if if I whatever, I've contributed to the situation, I'll be a little hard on myself about that. And to, to deal with that, you know, I, when I Catch myself in it. I'll just try to get away from the situation for a moment.

When I was in college, I had room for an extra course and even though it was at 8:00 in the morning, I took calculus just because I wanted the Challenge. And I also feel that you can never be too good at math but that's that's just the kind of thing. I like to take on those kinds of challenges and I think you're learning as a real positive.

And so that is, you know, going into those positions. You know, you kind of know that you're not going to be paid as much as a counterpart would be in the for-profit world, and, you know, you're not going in it for the money you're going in at four. the mission and, you know, the sense the sense of satisfaction or fulfillment that you get from having contributed to a worthwhile, cause the particular nonprofit organizations that I work with dealt with helping children, who had been abused and neglected had to be removed from their homes and put into foster care or even Institutional living and that just that was a challenge that was near and dear to my heart. And so yeah like I said I you know happily made the professional decision to maybe for go a little bit of near term Financial benefit for again being part of a worthwhile Mission.

So I'll admit at first I will kind of sit back and get a feel for the team. You know, I've been in situations where somebody comes in Bound and determined to just, you know, they've got new ideas and they're going to impose their will on the team. And, you know, they may have something valuable to offer but I think it's hard to immediately make drastic changes when you don't know, well, the team in the first place. So I'm the type who will again quietly, but also steadily make an effort to get to know the Jewels and how they come together as a team. I'm certainly not opposed to offering new ideas. Once I become confident, that the new idea is actually a good idea for the, on the situation that I've learned that I'm in."

My first step, when I find myself getting annoyed with, somebody is to be sure not to assume that I know their motivation for the annoyance. I've found that often the longer you deal with something that situation eventually the truth comes out and if you just immediately jump to the conclusion that they're just a bad person and they're just out to annoy you. Usually, Wind-up embarrassed in the end. So like I said my very first thing is to remind myself. They're probably not doing it on purpose and then so try to figure out what is it is a knowledge deficiency Talent, you know, is there a skill maybe they need to work on and then I dedicate myself to helping them work on that knowledge or that skill. And that's a second thing that I've learned in life, especially in my professional life is when you find somebody annoying and then you work with them, The annoyance goes away pretty quickly and you as you're working with somebody, you see them as a fellow valuable human being and again someone with challenges and strong things to offer of Their Own."

I've been in situations where just the logistics and everything just demand that you know things can be crowded or cramped and that's different but I if things are disorganized, one of the first things I have to do in the situation is bring some organization. To it. I just, I find that when it comes to being organized and having a plan A little work, upfront saves a lot of work later on as you're having to do rework. Mistakes are being made, you're having to take time in searching for things. And so, yeah, I mean, this is a big thing about me. If I'm walking into something too disorganized, it will be one of them. My initial goals to organize it."

Well, this is a very good question. I've been in situations such as this in the past and previous jobs. And I feel that if I have enough time and enough information, I can make a very good decision. I don't mean that I need a lot of time to make decisions, but I need accurate information. Also. I believe in being trained and learning everything. I need to know about the new position that I will be having. So so I would say, usually I behave in this situation typically very fair-minded and intelligent and I make good choices."

My experience has been to work with different teams of people frequently. And I am a positive person. I'm very outgoing and enthusiastic and I bring a lot of positivity to any new group that I'm working with. I enjoy working with newt. Teams and meeting new people. And usually, I'm able to take the leadership role depending on who's in the group of course and what their experience and expertise has. But also, I want to know that I want you to know that I'm not just a leader, but I'm also a person who likes to listen to information gather information and learn from the other people on the team. That's very important to me."

Well, to some degree I mean it's work. You don't actually have to like the person you work with it's a business relationship and I do have this ability to get along with with just about everyone. I haven't really had a hard time getting along with anybody even people that others have warned me are difficult. So yeah, that is my that is a very good quality about myself that I can just get along with people. Like I said, it doesn't always mean that I like them or enjoy them or want to hang out with them, but I get along with them, I'm able to work with them unless they actually cross the line but generally I don't like to bring things to the boss or anything. I believe we can we can solve our problems between the two of us. Also in a situation such as that if they're annoying me, they're probably annoying other people on the team and that's not good and that needs to be handled. So I really do. Know the specifics of the situation you're referring to but as mature working adults in the field I am sure. We can all sit down discuss and work out. Our differences shouldn't be a problem."

Quite frequently, this does come up. I generally typically am a very organized person, and I will devote a certain amount of time to organizations not just of my desk or my personal space, but of my mind and my thoughts and organization is very important to me. Me. But on the other hand, flexibility is also important. And I understand. Sometimes your workspace, your, your area cannot be organized and I get it. I'm all about flexibility, but sometimes we need to take a break and just organize our thoughts, organized, our desk, organize our area, and even maybe organize the people we work with and tell them what their specific roles and end of project is also. So, Some other people might freak out if things aren't very organized. So, if you're working with the team, it's pretty important to organize and just typically I find it easier to stay organized then to be unorganized and try to catch up."

One of those things is being consistent, being reliable. Now there is another thing that the Army taught me being trustworthy, this current position that I have is team manager for a company, which means I have access to basically everything. Within the company headquarters. And so I I've made comments before about how the trust that's given to me. I could really, really screwed things up if I wasn't trustworthy. So that in itself, I think indicates by trustworthiness weaknesses. As I've been getting older, I've been getting a little less patient with people. I still have it but I'm more. More aware of my feelings and my frustrations when it comes to people, when their actions. And what they tell me what they do this trains, I think that I'm a fairly likable person. These, my girlfriend tells me that all the time. I do enjoy talking with people talk about strength. I keep jumping back to his strengths and weaknesses, a thinking about them. Another weakness and this is something as I've gotten older, I really don't care for stupidity and I know that's not probably a really good word to use, but people that think they know everything when in fact, they don't I know that, I don't know everything and I'm not ashamed to admit that, I don't know. Something in to ask for assistance, that people that think they know everything and that won't ask for assistance, and then Mess things up. That definitely is one of my pet peeves. Other strengths. I don't know, I just, I have a good work ethic. I like to get things off my plate as they come onto the plate, you know, if I can get things accomplished than it, gives me some free time for other projects that I need. So, thank you."

That's kind of a trick question that my best friend I've known for probably about 50 some odd years. At that, we have breakfast, every the first Saturday of every month, and we've done a lot of things together. We had a band when I was in high school together and so asking him would probably be not the best thing because he is very blunt and sometimes Says things out of friendly meekness, if you know what that means, I think being trustworthy. I think being honest, I think being sincere he would say that I'm friendly. He would definitely tell you that I broke up the band because I actually joined the army in my high school senior year and that was one of the reasons why the band disabled or disbanded was because I went in the Army. So they would definitely tell you that. Generally, he would say that I am there for him. If I need to, he's had different time for he's been in the hospital and I've come to visit him up, give him a ride home. I've got, you know, so I think the definition of a best friend and he's the same way to me but so that I think I think both of us probably fall into this the same definition of a best friend. Someone you can count on someone, you can rely on."

When I came back in the country had back in 2012, I was applying for different positions. The one position, I remember the name of the company, but the one position was a manager of a coding Department, computer coding department, and my first interview, I made it very clear. That I am not a coding expert but I know. Enough about coding that I can manage people that do the coding and I was pretty sure that that was understood well. The second interview they started basically saying that I was going to be a coding person employee for this company and I probably could have faked my way through the interview and probably could have gotten the job and then I had no job at the time so I really needed something. But instead of doing that I actually told them, I said look if you're here if if I'm here interviewing for a position as a coder that you do not want to hire me if you want to look for a manager, then I'm the person for the job. So basically, because I was forthright with them and told them that, you know, I'm not a coder. Obviously, I didn't get the job. So yeah."

And the second position that I held over the country, was a manager of an IT department, and it was, it was an IT department, but they also did videos and they did documentation. And, and I Had two American contractors and I had 15 Afghan civilians working for me and entering a new team like that. I'm actually kind of quiet at first because I think what you need to do is you need to get a feel of what the other people are. Like, you need to get a feel of how other people react or interact with each other. And as it turned out, it was a great team. We all had a good time. Had good sense of humor between everyone, there were some cultural differences which I had to incorporate into how I led that team but in the end it turned out really well. And we did a really good job and worked really well together. So,"

And so I basically have interaction with with all the employees within the company. One particular gentleman, when he first came on board he kind of thought he was more important than what he is and he and he ignored me, he didn't want a lot of people. I actually learned just to ignore him when he was abnormally annoying and just deal with him on a professional level. I think that's the big key to working with people around. You is there are some people that you can joke with and some people we can be friendly with another people that you just have to be professional with. And as long as you are professional, normally, they will return. Likewise And so hopefully that hopefully that works."

So it's Someone is not in charge and I have the knowledge and I have the ability to step up, then I will I don't, I don't force my management skills, right? I don't force myself on anyone, but I think I think organization means that someone has to be in charge. Someone has to take the reins and point the direction that the company needs to go as long. As that's done, then pork in the workspace. Will be very organized. I'll tell my workspace. My desk is always, always organized, just like my home.

I can change my, you know, the way I work, my personality, how I approach people, I have that ability to adapt to the situation, whatever works best that I can get the most productive work out. That is my number one goal when I'm working as a team, you know, none of that leave someone behind past them up. Up. Now, we all come together and work together. There's no one left behind. Why do I think that? That's the way I am. That's just the way that I've been raised. That's what I believe that. You should always give your best and also help others. So you work good together so you can raise up, collectively,"

I'm generally, I type of person that I will try not to be around that person as much as possible if it's in a work environment. I want say anything because I am not going to cause any kind of ruckus that is going to interfere with the work performance. If it's something I feel that I'm very upset about I will go Go to a boss or I will pull that person aside later, but I will not bring it out into the work environment because I don't believe that's how you professionally should act. Why do I think that is? I just think that there's always a better way to handle things that there's you don't have to stoop to their level, or try to annoy them. I just feel that you rise above and you keep moving forward."

So I know where everything is that it's sufficient that I'm able to grab what I need quickly when I'm working on something. When it's at the end of the day, I try to make sure I put things back where I had them positioned that way when I come back into the next day. Everything is there ready? You know to roll. So that's just how I work. More productive. Really smoothly. Sometimes I can be a little bit of a messy you know, like scatter some things around. But generally I like to tidy up before the next to work day comes into play."

I am always looking at the bigger picture and can see how the the details fit into that. I also like to encourage and assist to my co-workers weaknesses. Sometimes I can be too concerned and spend too much time on details and trying to make sure everything is absolutely perfect, but I'm working on On that. Additionally, I just I think that I have a good sense of camaraderie. I'm able to step up when a leader is needed and yet, I'm also able to sit back when someone else is better suited to take that to take the lead.

Fearless. because generally, I'm not afraid to just I'm not afraid to be the first to try something. If something new is brought to us at work, I have no fear and rolling up my sleeves and becoming familiar with and trying something out in a new way. Not at all, afraid of change is long. As there's some reasonable belief that it's appropriate in the situation. She would describe me as an excellent editor. I I read and adviser on her emails and memos, and She looks to me, for input on how to communicate ideas to her staff, which we have a lot of fun. She on the other hand helps me consider being a less serious and to make sure and have fun at work. Should also describe me as quick industrious. With a somewhat smaller circle of friends at work, but simply because I like to stay focused and not get too distracted, always willing to help out co-workers. If they have a question, I'm not one to come and everyday distract everybody with with chatter that's unnecessary, and not related to the topic or that won't Bring a benefit to the group."

My response is not related to status related to how much money I make. I have a history of working for not-for-profit organizations in. Now I work for the government but previously prior to coming to government work at not-for-profit organizations It's always very conscious of how every dollar that goes out and salaries. One dollar, less that can go to the services, the Direct Services that are provided. So I was asked to come on board as the Director of health clinic. And was it was, was asked, I was given his, I believe, they gave me a salary, range and asked what my minimum was, and I told them, and they agreed to offer it to me, and I asked to think about it and thought about it. And I kept thinking that I think it was I don't remember is either 40 or 50 thousand dollars a year and that was more, it was probably eight thousand more than I was making at the time. It seemed to me that since I was able to take care of my personal finances on their money. I had been earning that that significant increase would mean that. A fewer dollars were going to serve people at the health clinic and that seemed a really important priority to me was getting more services to the people. So I actually called them back and told them that no, you know, I don't want that much. I actually which, which is probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever done in hindsight. I would not do that. I am an excellent worker. And I deserve to be fairly compensated. And so when you take an increase in responsibility, you should accept an increase in payment. I think that I did that simply because I was more concerned about the end result for the services to people. And and I thought that I would be just fine, you know, the my focus was on providing the service more Service as much Service as possible because That's, that's the whole goal. You're there to help see what did you? The most help. So, that was my thigh and it is important, but you do have to make sure that people doing, that type of work are compensated well, so that they stay fresh, they stand bigger it at, they stay excited. You don't want them just barely"

Well, the Midwest of the United States. I have first my first virtual meeting with everyone. I just kind of sat back, try to take everything in because it was an unexpected. David, an unexpected situation for me. So I was just trying to take everything in, try to get a feeling for what to expect from the group and then meeting the subsequent meetings. I was very engaged. Ask questions, but try not to take up too much time. I try not to annoy all of the people within the group with, with silly things that I can probably learn either by watching them or by reading, you know, doing my homework doing my, the best to figure things out that I could. But anyway, so at the beginning quiet and then within the next meeting or two incredibly engaged, very excited to be there. You identify the strong people that their You look at everybody, you identify their strengths and weaknesses and then you go to those people. Based on what your question, your need is, it's been really good."

And when I work, I tend to hyper-focus And so when anything, there are disruptions in the background, I find that annoying and new person came to the unit. He was very It goes beyond gregarious. You just flippant about his job period and did a lot of distracting noisy. Things that kept everybody from working and made me absolutely crazy. So I asked him to please Keep the music down. Maybe be quiet while we're all trying to work and eventually it wouldn't that that did not work at all. He just became louder because that's just how he is. Then I talked to the supervisor about it, and really, I think the best solution would have been to move him away from my workspace. That's not what they did. They actually had him, you know, told him to knock it off because he was distracting everyone. He really, really was but everybody else enjoyed the show. No other. People didn't mind being distracted from work and and stopping what they were. Doing 2 to watch the show. but he's better now, he does do is work now and we're great friends now, he actually maybe kind of became a mentor to him, once he knocked the crap off and been very helpful and he write think I'm his first go to when he does have a question. So and he has helped me as well, you know, with more social issues. So, but it started out very knowing got better."

Actually there's stuff out here and then because I think it's because I focus so much on what I am doing. I am unconcerned about what's going on around me. But then once I, I'm done with what I'm clued into that. I'll go back and home, I'll clean up and get ready for the next project next to ask. So my work itself is always very organized. It's just the environment, make it a little messy while I do it because you know, you're gonna look for stuff and my job. We still do a lot of peeper. So you still have file folders and you can have a big mess while the work is going on. But at the completion of Of whatever that task is and I'll tidy up and put it away. It's just the way I work."

I do what I say and I say what I mean, and people respect that, I typically will work very hard at what I do. I am on time. I'm prompt and I will stay as late as it needs to get the job done. Now, probably one of my greatest weaknesses as have been told me in the past, is that I tend to not be, I say five words, when 100 or do you know, I tend to speak less. I don't work as well. In a group setting. I tend to be the one that sits back and doesn't talk to others as much. So I need to proactively work on that in order to succeed in a group setting typically, other than that, I do work very well on my own. I typically am a very great producer on my own in my own environment that way."

I am reliable tool for a reliable and honest to a fault. Like sometimes I'm too honest than in his opinion. So that's I like it when he says that. Now, he would also say that any time for any reason, if he calls me and needs me, I'm there to lend my support whether it's just listening, you know, or if there's Something that he needs right away. I'll generally drop everything and go help him out in that crisis scenario. And to his credit, he only calls Mills urgent times when it's absolutely urgent. He doesn't like call me three times a week for quote, unquote silly things so it's it works that way. I'm willing to do that because it's only truly an urgent need for him. Yeah. Loving towards his kids, I treat his kids like, I trade my own really and and he does likewise with ours. So it's it's been in fun that way, just a great friendship."

Well, you know, the markup on that is 20% or higher. And so that's money in your pocket. But so that the constant ethical responsibility of doing Doing what your patients actually need as opposed to, what would make the practice or and therefore yourself more money. That is a constant mental Challenge and I also have to look at myself in the mirror just ask, okay? Did I do the right thing today? And did? I honestly ever do anything that would charge people more than they really needed to pay for the care for the level of care that they needed at that time?"

And so, when I come into a new practice with a new group of people like that, I typically just want to wait a few days and see how the practices run without making, you know, don't walk in and start, you know, change upsetting the apple cart, so to speak. Do Make all these changes right away and upset, how people go just figure out. What are best practices in that new scenario. And every time I have seen things that I wouldn't even consider doing that actually work better than what I've seen in the past and incorporating them into the new routine. And it's very important to get buy-in from the entire team before you make, especially large term changes, like scheduling and just everything. So getting goodbye.

So, so how do I react when I get annoyed? Most of the time? I just ignored, as long as I can, and then leave the room if I can't, on those rare occasions where I can't either ignore it or walk away. Then I'll be very direct and calm to say, Hey listen, you're really kind of annoying me right now. This is why how Can we get that behavior to to change and that usually reaction is surprise from the other person. Didn't know. I was annoying. You Bob, LA and most of the time is ends favorably for both parties. Sometimes the annoying is is intentional and got to deal with that too. What do you do in that situation? If it's a, you know, employee-employer relationship? That's a little easier to deal with when it's a up here working on You know, with a patient or whatever, you know, that gets a little more challenging and you just got to work through to resolve that and sometimes it in my experience a couple times.

I want to you know work as a unit in order to achieve the same goal. And why do I think that is? I'm here that way, just because that's kind of just who I am. I was raised by my grandparents, so I very much got fought brought up to believe in being polite, being good, manners, good etiquette and just in general, being able to carry myself in a, you know, a way that not only, you know, would make others proud but also a way that I can probably, you know, carry myself and Confident in knowing that you know person not projecting to the world is you know positive."

I am focusing more on balancing, my time and being able to delegate some tasks instead of trying to take everything on myself because I feel like it might be done a little quicker or more efficiently or more. Productively if I do it myself, but I have to realize that other people need opportunities to. So I am learning to accept that everyone needs to learn, everyone needs to grow and I really don't have to take the weight of the world on my shoulders. So that's one weakness that I'm working on"

I am where I say I'm going to be and I follow through with any tasks that I'm working on, I don't get frustrated or delay anything because it's not something that I want to do. I tend to prioritize things really well. I think she would say that. I'm also really Lee loyal and very amiable, and I'm a fun person to be around and that I get along well with everyone. And also that I'm really smart. We play trivia together and so have a lot of knowledge and a lot of different areas and I am able to utilize relationships with people and all the things that I've learned both from my personal and professional experiences in order to make myself, More room, rounded person."

You know, you have to look at your personal happiness and time and passions and all of those kind of can be considered to have a monetary or status type equivalent. So it's not just looking at a couple of factors, it's thinking about the whole landscape and perspective. What kind of time commitment does this involve? Like, what is my quality of life going to look like? If I change a career or move to a different city because of the job? Is it really going to be worth, you know, those kind of sacrifices and also weighing, you know, like their Option of the company. There are so many factors to consider and the most valuable thing to is really my family's input. So I don't want to make any decisions without consulting them."

I usually am Reserve beginning I really like to observe the culture and the personalities so that I can tailor my responses accordingly. I'm going to behave and have a consistent personality so it's not really me tailoring how I am but it's going to be thinking about how I respond to things differently so that they'll be more well-received. So I'm going to tend to be more casual and in the background in the beginning and then I like to move into areas where I can, you know, be more upfront and recognized and take on positions of leadership and management and things of that nature. So that I can really put myself out there and grow within the team because you always have to to start at the beginning and you know, learn the ropes and then eventually get to a place where you're teaching others."

Maybe it's because our personalities clashed maybe I didn't approach them in the right way. And a lot of times, I think it just is external factors or something that's going on in that person's life, there really has nothing to To do with the subject at hand. So I try to think about you know, the fact that it may not be me in particular but it could be something else that that person is struggling with and really try to look at that from their perspective and think about how I would want to be treated in those situations. So you know take some time to walk away from it. It and digest it and really understand the task and not let any other factors get in the way of your decision making."

Are usually when I get very, very busy and have a lot of projects and tasks that I'm managing at the same time. And so I tend to get a little bit messy and start collecting like documents and my calendar gets really stacked and so I don't have a lot of time to decompress In one activity in the next. And really think thoughtfully about like how I want to Archive documents or, you know, kind of straighten up things, physically around my desk and I think, I just, you know, get a little bit consumed by the task at hand because I operate under a lot of deadlines and I feel that pressure and and I don't feel like, I have the time sometimes to take the time to I organize myself or my thoughts after some of these tasks and so sometimes I have to wait to do several things before, I can take a pause."

I like to hear other people's ideas. I also, I like to, I also, like, to try new things. I don't like to stay in the same exact routine. I like to switch things up a weakness. I would see. I have is, maybe I like to spit stick to a schedule too much. Where if say all of a sudden hours or changed, I may want to stick to what I'm used to but my greatest strength. Yeah, I like to work with people, like to try new things, I like to hear people's ideas. Has I like to come up with my own ideas and explain those?"

That's really just based on If I'm happy and what department I'm in. And what I'm doing I may just choose to do that and not take a position that takes more money. If I think that I'm better at what I'm doing now, then I'm not going to go up and take another position to change my status, even if it means a lot more money. It's about just doing what you're good at and just finding where Your strengths are and making sure that you use your strengths and don't jump into it to a position where someone else could have stronger strengths there. Because if you leave your position, then somebody who has less stronger strengths and you could be taking it over and you would actually be needed where you were."

Not all personalities, mesh and some personality is you need to use different vocabulary when you're speaking to them and I like to kind of get to know where everybody is. Some people cannot take criticism so you want to be careful of that. Some people are open to criticism. But yeah, I like to get to know everybody and then just let them get to know my personality and also letting them know what I'm open for. Letting me know that I'm there to help, I'm there to work. I'm not somebody who's just going to try to take over, follow the chain of command."

You can't be thinking of how to get back. You need to be thinking about how to go about this. So that way you can have a good day if you have one or two employees who are annoyed at each other, they can't they have to act professional and they cannot try to. They know, they cannot try to change it, change the type of work that you are. They can't change the type of day. You're having everyone needs to be having a good day. So that way everybody can get there. Work done, you need to get your work done. Positively, you don't want to be all- getting your work done and That's how I usually react just if we need space and you need space, and if you're working too closely together, maybe that can also be changed."

You need to just grab things and use them. You can't spend 5 10 minutes trying to find each and every single item or paper that you need. So it's not typical for me to work in the environment that is not organized because if somebody is in charge of the organization and I don't like how they're doing it, I can always offer during my free time or find some free time somewhere that I can help to organize it and maybe the person just needs some help to get it organized. And that's also a good bonding experience to working with an employee to show that you care and you want to help them, get it organized. But no, it's not typical for me to work in a place. That's not organized."

No matter how many jumps I have to are Hoops, I have to jump through. I will always want to reach that goal and I will make sure that I can finish it. But also make sure that the people that are surrounding me and working with me, are encouraged to reach their goals and need any help that is needed. But a weakness of mine is that I will Due to being very stubborn, I really want to make sure that I can meet that goal. And so sometimes when I get very stressed out to reach that goal, I do become a little bit more certain and I will only want to focus on that. So I would be able to help in any of my peers and they're reaching their goals. If I need to get to my deadline faster than I can help them."

When you first meet me, I am more quiet and reserved, but once I'm more comfortable with you, I will tell you my opinion and I will not really feel bad about telling you my opinion. And I will have an opinion, everything she was. So, she'll decide that shot and also very she also described me as kind. I feel like she knows. I will always be there for her. I'm very supportive of all of my friends. I see them more as family and I want to make sure they can do there. Very best. So I would also be like. That should also probably describe me as a goal, Reacher. I don't back down for when I want something and I will do my best to get what I want in a healthy way. I could also, I would also probably should also describe me and spending a lot of money on the things I want because if I want it I'm going to get it, Go wise or your life wise."

I, like I said, I make sure I get every gold done and I also am usually care for the company that I work for. And so I want to make sure that everything goes right for patrons as well for that. And so making sure that I'm develop those relationships. Those patrons that I want, if it was a food Business. Get the things that they wanted retail made. Sure they got the best deal while. Also making sure the company works out I wanted, I put them first as well which helped see that bond with the patrons for how I did it. My professional job and then I would also help cover missing positions during that same time which would also I guess was like a mom situation. So, I made sure that everything was covered, no matter what happened,"

I don't know them, they don't know me yet and I want to make sure I can remember their names, which may be a struggle for me sometimes. And so I'm usually really quiet kind of very polite. I want to make sure that I'd somehow don't offend people. I think that's just because I am the eldest sister. So I want to make sure I'm respect people and that that no one is Is mad and so I make sure to be polite. I also I usually am more reserved until a couple months and so I won't ask questions or I want but I won't have my will make small talk, I just won't bother them at all. I will also won't ask questions unless it's very necessary. I usually will try to figure it out myself and then try to find a peer in that is close to my Aid or closest to my age.

See if they did it on purpose and if they were joking because if I get so serious into what I'm doing that, I can't tell if it's a joke or not, so I need to make sure it's a joke first before doing anything before I get annoyed or I try to remember that. And then if it is like they're just trying to annoy me, I tell them go away. I'm trying to focus and if they're not I try to remember that they're not trying to annoy me. That's just me. Trying to do my own thing and then try to help him with whatever questions they have. I think that I usually work in more high-paced areas, so when someone annoys you, you don't have time to be annoyed. And so that is another reason why I get annoyed because it's just, usually no time for being annoying."

And so you're not going to be organized. Everyone's trying to focus on reaching their own goal, which is why that's usually typical of me for not being organized. I will only be focusing on my thing. So I won't watch anybody else organization, which is usually why it's not working eyes. And the one time an organized, it's just because I'm trying to do with the Hyatt The fast-paced environment that I am working in and so I I mean that's mainly. It is also because I'm just trying to reach that goal. So I'm not really paying attention to my surroundings. I will believe that I could clean it up later if I've got the time and if I don't have the time right now that something for me to do later. Yeah."

But yeah, I would say that. Otherwise my strengths, I guess mostly just reside in need to learn. I'm constantly in my free time, looking for new opportunities, to learn.

You know, I try not to lash out or be passive-aggressive. That's something I really can't. Stand is passive aggression, so I think practicing mindfulness is kind of help that in a lot of ways, just being able to step outside of it. And gain a broader perspective, like, oh, maybe they're having a bad day or, you know, how can I approach this in a way for instance, if they're doing something that is rightfully annoying. How do I approach it in a way? That's not, you know, too aggressive or just inappropriate?"

There are four whatever the organization requires. But I would say that. Would be typical of me in the grand scheme of what everybody else is workspace. May look like. It's one of those things were, like, I know where everything is. And I understand how my own format is in like where everything resides, and I think that's just because I Have a lot going on up here.

I feel like it's more productive to have a clean workspace. So everything is like well organized and clean and it just makes it easier overall. It's also like nicer to look at. So it helps with the mental like aspect as well. I think I'm like this because of the way I was brought up my parents always, like, told me to clean my room, stuff like that.

So, Not really feel annoying, but this situation is just learn how to manage and you gain experience. When you start, and when you young, sometimes you can lose control yourself. But with time you, you learn learn how to control the the people. It's just You know, my recommendation for new supervisor has always take advantage of the companies. If they offered training, take all the training, they can and manage people how to control themselves, you know, it's sometimes it can be hard but you had to do it.

Every time a new manager came aboard, the company or the department is star. Again, so it's like dealing with employees. You have to be prepared for all these kind of situations and try to do the best. And there's not a perfect organization, all organization that I have issues some, there's not a perfect company.

You had to be aware of what was needed to be done. And when and set your priorities for the day and I welcome the challenge. I enjoyed that very much, I missed it every day.

So then I will accumulate supplies or materials to give me new ideas for a new project and they will go. Up on the Shelf on top of the previous ideas for a new project or idea. And next thing, I know, six months later a year later, I have a pile of piles and it's overwhelming sometimes, but it's also inspiring because I'm able to look and see that I've been busy and I've been doing a lot of positive creative things and that helps me to feel good about what I do."

I was reliable. So when kind of work came up, whether it's within my team or just like, kind of something that one of my superiors kind of picked up, they could come to me and I would be kind of more than willing to just like help them out with specific things or maybe just like take on. The whole project if I had time. I think like that level of flexibility as well as just like being reliable, is certainly something that is very useful, especially within my job right now, where is a very fast pace and there are so many things kind of popping up at once. It's very its client facing. So clients usually want a lot of different things. So being able to be someone who is flexible for that, certainly something that I'm good at I would say some of my weaknesses include and kind of In that same breath is like taking on a little too much at one time and potentially doing shoddy work because of the level of deadlines that I have. So I think I need to be better about saying no and also knowing my boundaries without getting burnt out. Also, one of my other kind of weaknesses is not Being fully kind of present during conversations, because I'm focused on other things within work. So, I would definitely want to get better at that. And I think being able to just not have as much on my plate in terms of workload, will kind of just like alleviate some of the global dissociation of like, oh, I have to get things done rather than just like, you know, be able to just like I can just be myself within that and have little more kind of leniency when it comes to that."

Yes, I can be very a life of the party at times, but sometimes I don't really want to do that. Sometimes I do just like saying at home and just like doing something small and intimate and I think having that level of quality time and having someone, or a group of people so long. Group people really care about me is something that I really value and I think that I can be kind of just like a great person within that. Not only do I show compassion and empathy for my friends especially when they go through things that are tough and just like have some substantial conversations for them to feel comfortable with their position in the world, but also just like invoke a level of humor and it into it as well.

I think this is kind of a big one for me, especially because when I went to college, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. And so I just knew that my parents were struggling financially and so I was like, let's look at something that's like you know, well paying for bachelor's degree and kind of the best thing you can go with that is like either business or you know within like the tech field and so I chose computer science and I think in terms of my personality and like what my thought process was through that was just like I feel like it was more like being able to just like Be holistic in my thinking about where all that holistic and practical, especially because of the way that I didn't necessarily care about, like, computer science as much. I'm into Tech and I like doing technical things, but I'm not necessarily keen on it beat. But I think knowing that it would be a good role to a good kind of profession to go into especially because of of money and stuff. I think it shows a level Practicality just like wanting to care for my parents because I think ultimately that was what kind of drove me to do that. And I think the reason for that is because my parents have just like given up so much to make me have a good kind of life and education in general. They work constantly all the time. And so, I would just want to give back to them in any capacity that I can. And now that I am because of my computer science degree, which is really kind of a valuable Thing.

I'm going to rotational program, and I'm working with a team that I have nothing. I have no kind of prior knowledge, and it's in ux, and UI design, and having a background in computer science. I know a little bit about like, kind of like research practices because I've taken a couple classes in college and stuff, but I am way I am in such a different kind of Realm. Most people have their Are phds for ux/ui research, and I have a Bachelors in computer science. So, foundational research has been kind of a big thing for me and it's been a little difficult to like engaging conversation. Ask some questions sometimes like, I don't even, I don't even like, I know anything to even ask a question, I think, part of that level of like, just like holding back comes from like, not wanting to look stupid. And I have kind of this like, Okay. Personality thing where I feel like I need to just like be perfect in a lot of ways and even if like, I'm not understanding something I will sacrifice like may be looking a little silly in the moment just to upkeep like kind of the idea that I am someone who knows what I'm talking about and someone who is reliable. I want to be someone who is of value and someone again, who people can come 24 for anything and I think because I've made it a little clearer that my background isn't in. Ux people have tend to realize that, like I have other skill, sets, skill, sets skill, sets elsewhere. But, yeah, I think, one of the reasons, especially, because I want to come off as reliable,"

I think I've become a little apathetic, and one of the reasons why I would get annoyed with someone is because they're, not showing a lack of empathy or kind of just like being in my footsteps a little bit. If you're not able to kind of understand where I'm coming from, I feel like I can't really do the same for you because I think I will always try and it's like understand where I might go wrong. If we're having kind of a disagreement and I'll be like, okay, like here's where I messed up and like, I understand that, but that's not what, that's not my intention. This is what I kind of met when I completely understand where you were coming from with that kind of level of thinking especially with like the way I would, You know, articulate things but I think if people will kind of hold that against me or like don't give me the same benefit of the doubt and just like be empathetic with me. I intend to get frustrated and I'll kind of shut down a little bit and not I don't really get like aggressive with with my way that I'm speaking, because I don't really work. Well, when people like, kind of raise their voice, you're just like, get aggressive with with that kind of just like, in a high tension area. So, I kind of might, I kind of just will shut down a little bit and feel a pathetic, come back to it a little bit later and talk. like what I was thinking before and now I think most of that is just because yeah, I don't really care for like go getting into a yelling argument and, you know, potentially making things even worse because I know people will feel like they My say something silly which I don't necessarily think that would happen but I still think like when tensions are high it creates a level of like fight or flight with in relationship and like I don't want that to be the case because people going to mess up and it's very human to just mess up and I don't care to engage in that."

And I feel like I don't really need to move it because I don't have space for it but regardless it is pretty typical and I think I don't really mind my kind of surrounding sometimes because I get so kind of laser focus on what I'm doing that. The other things around me will necessarily be Super kind of prominent. I'll think about it things to do rather than just like keeping my workspace with a nice but I think I've been a little bit better in recency because I think having a tidy workplaces you know just like signaling that someone has like a tidy mind and I think I would need that for my work."

So I'll come up with ideas that are great ideas in theory, but I probably don't follow through with them as much as I should that. And and sometimes I'm too. Too critical of myself.

Because the pay incentive up into that new role with those new responsibilities doesn't line up with what I feel I should be paid for the work, I'm doing in the experience that I bring to a position. So I would say that I am very dead set on making sure that I am being paid for the work that I'm doing.

And the reason that I conduct myself in that way is because I know that only, I can advocate for myself as a worker and employer isn't an advocate for me."

When I start on a new team, I've a lot of social anxiety and I never really know how I like conduct myself. That can make me very anxious getting used to new people that said I am very much the like I'll lean on jokes a little bit. I'm a little more like a planner, a jokester when I'm getting used to new people or like settling in with new people. I'd like to hear people laugh. I like to create that easygoing like calm. Oh gosh. It's the word calm, like friendly environment to start out with. I'm very helpful, very respectful. I tend to err on the side of caution. One of the greatest feedback that I've gotten from other employees and co-workers in the past, is that I asked for permission to do things that I don't need to ask for permission to do, especially in the beginning of being, with a new group of people just because I don't always know what the expectations are and I would rather err on the side of caution. Caution and ask more questions than I need to and that kind of thing, then then mess something up. So a little withdrawn, a little shy, a little quiet, until I get comfortable. And then and then my personality comes out a little bit more."

I've worked in a lot of customer service jobs. I'm used to working with the public and I'm used to just being like inconvenienced annoyed. I usually handle it very well. I unfortunately have very little control over how much of my eyebrows move so I know that my facial expressions can give away when I'm annoyed sometimes but generally I'm very good at keeping. My patient maintaining a professional. Personal attitude and just really conducting myself with a sense of like dignity in that way. There are a lot of I think, one of the hardest things for a lot of people myself included at times, it's a step back and remember that it's very unlikely that somebody else is doing something strictly because they're trying to annoy me and if they are, that's a completely different situation but just making sure that I step back and think they're not trying to do this. You need to be a patient like this just it is what it is and it's okay."

Almost to the point of it being detrimental, I can't ignore chaos in my workspace to get work done. I have to address that chaos and then I can do my work, which I think that if I can maintain my clean, workspace is fine. I can stay productive, I'm working and working and working, but it can become detrimental. When I don't have total control over that space. Chaos, me May ensue. And then I have to address that chaos before I can get work done. So I would say that my work spaces tend to stay very clean and very organized. I'm very good at. I need to put this back where it belongs a part of that is having ADHD, I need to like, maintain those routines and maintain things in their same place, so that I can find them again later, if I put something in a new place, or there's a bunch of chaos, it's really hard for me to find things and be productive. So, I would say that I We'll get like to the end of a project sometimes and in an effort to just like make it to the Finish Line complete. This project meet a deadline, I won't be as clean and there might be more papers on my desk or like a pile of sticky notes that I need to address as far as tasks I need to do but I would say that it's not very typical of my workspace to be messy and what it is. It's usually because I'm trying to push towards like that blast like a little bit of work and then and then I'll go back and clean my space."

It is very uncommon that I would ever miss work and I usually never take sick days. I never no call, no show. I'm very reliable. One of my weaknesses as an employer's, probably that I'm a perfectionist. Something that I do is I usually get too involved in my work which can slow me down, that is one of my weaknesses.

One characteristic that my best friend would probably use to describe me, is that I'm a fun-loving. I'm always looking for fun, new experience, a fun new adventure. And my best friend. Would probably also say that I'm adventurous. I'm always trying to try new food, go to new places, see new movies, another thing that my best friend would say to describe me as I am very loyal.

When I think of times that I made professional decisions that could have affected my status and how much money I make in the long run. One of the main decisions that comes to mind is pursuing higher education. One of the things, one of the main reasons why I am currently pursuing higher education, at this time is because I believed that I could affect my status and how much money I make down the road. Generally people who are more educated earn 1 million dollars more in their lifetime than people who have not gone through higher education.

When I joined a new team of people, every new job that I have started. I've had to join a new team of people from different backgrounds with different beliefs. And I've had to adapt to this group, learn how to get along with them. In addition to work another situation where I have joined a new team of people is whenever I start a new class in school. Whenever I start a new class in school, I meet new people from all different walks of life and often I have to do group projects with them. So when I'm in the workforce, or when I'm at school, I'm often I have to join new teams of people."

When people have annoyed me, I can think almost every day. I if I'm driving and there is, you know, offensive unsafe driver that annoys me because it Jeopardizes my safety and stresses me out other times. When people annoy me, is when I have a manager that micromanages me, like I said, earlier, I'm very reliable. And I take my work, seriously. I'm a perfectionist. So, I don't really think it's necessary to be micromanage. So, when I am micromanage, let me tell you what. It really annoys me. Me."

And generally, I would always make an effort to keep my work area clean and organized, especially clean because you had to meet certain sanitary guidelines. But when we hit a busy dinner rush of busy lunch rush whenever we were extremely busy, there were so many orders and so there was so much work to do that.

It's a the company pretty much a lot of money and save time as well too and and pretty much helped me get a get a pay raise. So easy in this type of situations I always behave excited and happy. I'm excited to take on these tasks reason why I think that that is the case because I'm from someone that is very eager to learn. Eager to take on tasks even if it's something that I'm not familiar with. With. So I tend to be always, you know, excited to take on these tasks.

So let's say 15 may be more outgoing or you know, ask more questions or and as something that I mean a respond more to And so, what do I think that is, the reason why I think that is, is because I think it's important to understand the team Dynamic, and it's really important to be able to adapt to the team. So, using positions, when you're hard, not only are you hired for the skills, you know, for the skills and most importantly your heart, whether you can fit the team Dynamic and having that team Dynamic makes, you know, mixed everything flow and Worked just like having having a good team makes makes a dream.

I don't express it, I don't because you don't know, you know, where the factors so using situations that keep calm second. Now, I'll pretty much, you know, try to understand what's going on and understand situation, try to see now the best in people and I'll stay calm and sometimes maybe if they're reacting in a way where it's annoying me. It could be that just having a bad day. I so I try to be aware of the situation was going on and not take anything personal. So why do you think that is? I think it's important to have these You know, qualities were reacted reactant, this type of situations because we don't want to explode and we don't know what's everyone situation is. So if we were to explode one day, that could cost you a job that could cause your promotion, I can cost quite a lot of things. So it's not worth to, you know, react in those situations. It's best not to react ticket, personally, whether if it were this big issue and talk to your manager or whether they can share it, you know, someone that's not real. With a friend or maybe you can laugh about it. And that's, you know, where the best ways to go about it."

How typical is out of you and what do you think that is? So going to accompany, you know, especially a start-up can expect, you know, things to be well, organized or well-established, because the company will be pretty much, you know, starting off. Or even sometimes when you go to another company has made me well established. They won't be a pretty much well organized as far as my experience in the past. I I have seen where it has not been in either. One of us are organized or maybe not been established, which I don't see. The issue is. So why do I think that is? Well, there is a reason I said, fuck the reason why the position is open. So your role or dubs also, maybe, you know, not only to complete those roles and tasks but in a way to fall certain process and help the company, you know, and insert your own way or Your roles way to keep the company organized and yeah."

I would say the one of my biggest weaknesses would be utilizing the help of others. So I'm not all that. Great at delegating work or looking. Being externally to see who can help me out who can do things for me, so that we can together create kind of a better job and a better workplace. So it's something I work on. I'd say another great strength would be that I am a pretty good motivator. So even though it's hard for me to work with others and include others or delegate work to others. What I do get connected with But yeah, my team is easy for me to motivate them to teach them to show them what they need in order to take the ball and run with it. I think that's another big strength -"

I think that my best friend are also described me as kind and always looking for human connection and a way to connect with others, learn with others. And Go with others. I, If I had to pick a few more things, I'd say, my best friend would describe me as the active, not always stuck in a rut or hardest stuck. In hard to get stuck in a rut because I'm always pretty active and just always looking for more learning and just trying to make things better and improve processes."

I'd see, I usually behave pretty calmly in those situations. I think that is because I do a great deal of research and comparison when a situation like that is going to be presented to me. Or I can see it's coming up on the horizon and in taking that Time to prepare for that decision, that may affect status or income. I really weigh the pros and cons and the upside the downside, I think a lot of people don't stop to think about what the upside and downside is to their current situation. And what the upside and downside is to their future situation, especially if it's affecting status or money. And if you actually take the time, not to just look at pros and cons but actually upside for advancement downside for Maybe risk or loss. You may see that there's often times where there's very very big upside and very, very little downside, especially when it comes to staying in your current position or not making that as personal decision. And when you think of things that way it's pretty easy to stay calm because, you know, that your current position. It's no big deal. If you don't make this decision and then if you do make this decision, the downside could be really low in the upside, could be really high, and that's pretty. T reinforcing pretty confidence-inspiring."

I just joined a new team of people a few months ago so when I enter a new team I usually behave a little more polite open kind and considerate definitely take on more of a listening role rather than a sharing or an outward role and I think that is because I'm trying to get a feel for how things actually work. It's important. It to understand teams of people how they communicate, how they work before you craft your response, or your idea and deliver it to them. You know, you can say something in a certain way and it comes off as positive. You can say that exact same thing in a different way and it comes off as - it really depends on who your audience is. So when I enter a new team, I really need to get a feel for that. How they listen? How They are so that when I share my idea or whatever it may be, it is it shared in the correct way? A way that's receptive to them, and actually gets the idea across same idea, no matter how you say it, but it may be heard different way depending on the team. So, it's really important to listen and understand that team before you start sharing and kind of having more outward roll."

But recently, I've changed my mind set on that. I've really come to understand that all humans have needs that are trying to be met and they have certain feelings that they feel when needs are met or feelings, that they feel would needs are not met. And when you think about all humans, like that is just as pursuit of fulfilling their needs. You have a lot more empathy for people and you also realize that they're not attacking you or they're not trying to do anything to bring you down. They're simply trying to meet their own needs. So now, when someone annoys me so to speak, I react with understanding and compassion and a thought of what needs met. Be trying to meet in that situation. And how might they be feeling and what needs of mine are now not being met in this situation? And how might I be feeling because of this and that self empathy and then empathy for the other person allows us to then, take a step back, and come to come to a solution that actually fulfills. The needs of both of us rather than thinking this person's annoying me. They're annoying there. You know there? They're not doing any good for me. It's all me me, me, me me. When you have that self empathy for your for yourself, which is okay, and then having that empathy for them, you just see annoyances in a completely new light and realize that they're not annoyances. They're simply someone just trying to meet their needs."

Especially my physical workspace. It's generally pretty organized at times my work itself, because I work in a digital space can be a little disorganized, and I think that is because when I'm working on something that I don't really have a lot of passion or care, for, it's hard for me. To really care enough to actually do the work. And then also make sure it's totally organized and buttoned-up, if I don't have a whole lot of passion for it, I understand that I can do the work and whether it's organized or not, doesn't matter if it still gets done. But when you actually have work that you care about, not only do you want to do it in complete it, but you want to maybe reference in the future, maybe share with others and show it off. And if it's organized, that makes it Even easier to do those things. So that's why I think I may have times when I've organized work and not organized work."

I've never had trouble working either by myself or with other members of the team. So I would say my greatest strength is flexibility in the workplace and Yeah, I tend to be independent when I need to be and I'm flexible enough to work with groups when I need to. So my greatest weaknesses are Pride. I usually don't reach out for help. For others. When I think it's something that I can do. And yeah, thank you very much."

There's been times, when out of the blue they're like hey can you help me with XYZ? Like can you come help? Watch my cat, I'm going out of town and I'll definitely agree to help with that. So I would say they they think I'm Dependable the I think they would also say I'm very approachable, I don't have any recollection of friends not want. You to come to me and speak to about things. I think I'm very approachable and and also confidential about things that they say to me whenever they like confide in me and give me maybe like embarrassing details or need advice. I'm always able to give them advice on that and and Coach them through it. And and keep that information they give me confidential. I mean, I don't like to go around, spreading rumors."

So in situations that could affect my status or how much money I make typically like, if I'm asking for a promotion or a raise at a company, I work for, I will go in calm and confident. I think that's the most important lay out my worth to the company, lay out what I'm providing to them and think of any Points of Leverage I have and then use that to persuade them into giving me more compensation. And I think the reason I do that is because I think it gives me the best chance of making more money or increasing my status. So, yeah, that's that's how I act during situations that can affect my status, or determine how much money that I make."

I'm usually kind of a little bears Earth but very friendly and open and I want to kind of gauge how these people act what they're expecting from me. So basically I'm dipping my toes in the pool, trying to feel out how I should act And and I think I do that because I obviously want to fit in when you're a newcomer in a newcomer to a team, you obviously want, you don't want to be alienated or have them view, you weird or different, especially initially because first impressions are very important. So yeah, I think that's why I do that. I kind of just want to fit in and engage the This scenario, before I start acting in a certain way."

There's a couple of factors that determine how I react a is, is this intentional or they being annoying on purpose. Another factor is the degree to, which they annoyed me, that also plays a part in it. Another factor is, where am I when this happens? Because if I'm in a professional setting, I probably would act. one way, but if I'm in a personal setting, Excuse me, I would probably act in a different way so it totally depends on a multitude of factors. But typically, In general, I would say I'm level-headed and I'm not quick to react to people, annoying me. I can brush it off or realize it's not intentional and get past it. So I'm generally able to keep a level head and not allow external factors to impact me, but at the same time, if if it's to a degree where it warrants a reaction, then I will have a reaction."

Stay on top of things, things are less, likely to slip my mind. And yeah, I think it's it's very typical. You loved me when I was younger. I think I had issues with organizing my work and over time I've developed systems and put things in place that allow me to stay on top of things and that's definitely helped me in my schooling and also in my professional life at work. So yeah, I do think it's beneficial to work ethic and productivity to keep your work organized."
