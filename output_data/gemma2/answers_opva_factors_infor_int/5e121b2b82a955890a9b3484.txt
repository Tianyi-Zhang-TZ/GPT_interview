Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0 

**Why:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a good level of conscientiousness. They show a strong emphasis on organization, detail-orientation, and responsibility in their work.  They strive for accuracy and completion, expressing anxiety when mistakes are possible. Their desire to follow rules and avoid passing work off to others also points towards conscientiousness. 
* **Extraversion:**  The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations, especially with unfamiliar people. They prefer to listen and observe rather than lead discussions and seem hesitant to engage in after-work social events. Their preference for keeping work and personal life separate further suggests a lower level of extraversion.
