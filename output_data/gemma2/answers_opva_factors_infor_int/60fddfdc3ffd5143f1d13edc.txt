Here's a personality rating based on the provided responses, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
* **Supporting Evidence:** The individual demonstrates a clear awareness of the importance of organization and attention to detail in their work. They express a desire to be a reliable and responsible employee, aiming to improve their performance and work ethic. While they acknowledge past struggles with feeling overwhelmed and burnt out, their desire to improve suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness. 

* **Counterpoints:**  There isn't strong evidence of extreme conscientiousness. They don't mention rigidly adhering to schedules or rules, nor do they express an overwhelming drive for achievement.

**Extraversion: 0 (Low)**
* **Supporting Evidence:** The individual consistently describes themselves as introverted and expresses discomfort in unfamiliar social situations. They prefer listening and asking questions over dominating conversations. They actively avoid social events where they don't know people well.

* **Counterpoints:**  While they strive to be positive and supportive at work, this doesn't necessarily indicate high extraversion. Their desire to help teammates stems more from empathy than a need for social stimulation.
