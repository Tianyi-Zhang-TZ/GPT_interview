Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0

**Explanation:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates some conscientious behavior (attention to detail, commitment once involved), there are also instances of carelessness and lack of organization ("I don't really remember a time where I can put equipment back at work").  Overall, their behavior suggests a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual consistently expresses a preference for solitude and discomfort in social situations ("generally, I just want to be left alone", "I don't warm up to people"). They describe themselves as reserved and  avoidant of social events. This points towards a low level of extraversion.
