Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong organizational skills and commitment to tasks, especially when leading a charity organization, there are instances where they express flexibility and a willingness to prioritize family over work commitments. This suggests a level of conscientiousness that is present but not exceptionally high. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently portrays themselves as sociable, outgoing, and comfortable in social situations. They actively seek connections with people, enjoy group discussions, and readily take on leadership roles. However, they also acknowledge their need for downtime and personal space, indicating that their extraversion is not overwhelming or always present.
