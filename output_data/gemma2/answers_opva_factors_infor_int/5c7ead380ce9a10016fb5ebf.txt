Conscientiousness: 2 (low)
Extraversion: 2 (low)

**Justification:**

While there are glimpses of conscientiousness in the answers (like valuing order and paying attention to detail), the individual consistently expresses a preference for solitude, avoiding social events, and not actively seeking to uplift team members. This suggests a lower tendency towards extraversion and conscientiousness.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual occasionally mentions a preference for organization and thoroughness, but often expresses reluctance to push themselves beyond their limits or take on additional responsibilities. Their focus on "doing what's necessary" rather than actively striving for excellence leans towards a lower conscientiousness score.
* **Extraversion:**  The individual clearly identifies as introverted and avoids social situations. They express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and prefer to listen rather than take a leading role. This consistent avoidance of social interaction strongly points towards a low extraversion score.
