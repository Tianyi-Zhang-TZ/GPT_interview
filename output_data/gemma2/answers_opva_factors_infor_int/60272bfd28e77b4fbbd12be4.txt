Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0

**Rationale:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits consistent with a medium level of conscientiousness. They value organization, detail-orientation, and completing tasks efficiently. They also display a preference for sticking to established routines and minimizing risks. However, they don't seem overly driven by achievement or perfectionism, suggesting a medium rather than high level.
* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort and preference for solitude in social situations. They describe themselves as introverted and  content observing rather than leading. While they acknowledge the value of social connection, they express anxiety and a need for distance in most social settings. This pattern strongly suggests a low level of extraversion.
