Here's a breakdown of the personality ratings based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Supporting Evidence:**  The individual demonstrates awareness of the importance of detail and organization in their work ("My whole profession is attention to detail"). They also show a tendency to plan and strategize ("I tend to invest in my work... I felt that... if not today I would get the matter tomorrow...").  However, there are instances of procrastination ("I also tend to procrastinate a lot") which suggests a less strong drive for organization and self-discipline.

* **Counter Evidence:** The occasional mention of frustration and feeling overwhelmed by bureaucracy ("...the employees over there... they would not work as hard..."), suggests that they may not always be as effective at regulating their own behavior and adhering to strict routines.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Supporting Evidence:** The individual expresses enjoyment in social settings, particularly when they don't know people ("I'm actually much more happy in a social setting when I don't know anyone"). They also describe themselves as a natural leader in group discussions and enjoy informal interactions ("I've always had the leading role... I enjoy group negotiations").

* **Counter Evidence:** There are instances where they mention a preference for solitude or a desire to avoid large social gatherings ("I tend to be more you know how to word...at least in the beginning and end. That's that's the fun part..."). This suggests a moderate level of comfort with social situations rather than a strong preference for them.

**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited sample of responses. A more comprehensive assessment would require a wider range of questions and a deeper understanding of the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in various contexts.
