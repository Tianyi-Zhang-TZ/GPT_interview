Here's a personality assessment based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)**

* **Supporting Evidence:**  The individual demonstrates a clear awareness of the importance of organization and attention to detail ("I made myself I care about what I'm doing, so I would clean it and put it back in place."). They also show a tendency to work hard and persevere even when faced with challenges ("Even work atmosphere. I guess I will tend to not do anything in like to work hard in order for people to to notice that I deserve what I want instead of really going for it"). 
* **Nuance:** While they value these traits, there's not a strong indication of rigidly adhering to rules or systems.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Supporting Evidence:**  The individual acknowledges feeling shy in social situations with unfamiliar people ("LOL, I remember my first internship...It was really hard for me to try to know them..."). They also express a desire to improve their social skills and actively put themselves in social situations ("I also put myself in particularly at the beginning or anyting... I think it's important to know people..."). 
* **Nuance:**  While they recognize their shyness, there's a willingness to step outside their comfort zone, suggesting a medium level of extraversion.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Data:** These ratings are based on a relatively small sample of responses. A more comprehensive assessment would involve additional questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
* **Subjectivity:**  Personality assessments always involve some degree of subjectivity. Different psychologists might interpret the same responses slightly differently.
