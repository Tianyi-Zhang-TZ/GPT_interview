Here's a personality rating based on the provided responses, using the HEXCO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates awareness of the importance of details and organization (Question 2, 6), but also expresses some difficulty with multitasking and a tendency to be intimidated by new technologies (Question 4).  This suggests a balanced approach to conscientiousness rather than a high or low level.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**
* **Evidence:** The individual describes feeling social anxiety in new situations (Question 1) but also actively seeks out social engagement through poetry and open mic nights. They also seem comfortable taking on leadership roles in discussions (Question 3) and express a desire to help others feel better (Question 7). This mixed pattern points to medium levels of extraversion.
