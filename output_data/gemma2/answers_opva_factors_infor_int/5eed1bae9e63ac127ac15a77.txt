Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 1 

**Here's why:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates a strong focus on detail and accuracy in their work history (Question 6), there are instances of impulsivity and acting against professional norms (Question 8). This suggests a mid-range level of conscientiousness ¨C they value order and precision but aren't always strictly rule-bound.

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "a little outgoing" but also expresses discomfort in new social situations (Question 1) and a preference for listening over leading in group discussions (Question 3).  They also mention shyness and avoiding social events (Question 5). These tendencies point towards a medium level of extraversion ¨C they can be social but prefer smaller, more familiar settings.
