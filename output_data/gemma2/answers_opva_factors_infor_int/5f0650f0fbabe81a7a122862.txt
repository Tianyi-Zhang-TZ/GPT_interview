Here's a personality rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 2 (Medium)** 

* **Supporting Evidence:**  The individual demonstrates a clear preference for order and structure. They emphasize the importance of putting things back where they belong, meticulously paying attention to details in their work, and seeking second opinions to ensure accuracy.  They also describe themselves as calculating and strategic when making decisions, suggesting a thoughtful approach rather than impulsivity.
* **Counterpoint:** While they value these traits, the statement "sometimes those outcomes that I don't want it's not a part of me by try to not do that" hints at occasional slip-ups or struggles with complete control.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Supporting Evidence:** The individual expresses a preference for smaller, more intimate social gatherings and avoids large events unless they offer professional benefits or involve close friends. They describe themselves as introverted and acknowledge a preference for listening over leading in group discussions.
* **Counterpoint:** There are glimpses of potential extraversion in their desire to network at company events and their willingness to contribute ideas and perspectives during discussions. However, these instances seem driven by a calculated approach rather than a strong inherent need for social interaction.



**Important Note:** Personality assessment is complex and relies on a variety of factors beyond a few brief answers. This rating is a preliminary estimate based solely on the provided text.
