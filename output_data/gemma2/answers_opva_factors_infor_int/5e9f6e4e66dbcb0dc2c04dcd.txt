Here's a personality rating based on the provided responses, keeping in mind that this is a limited assessment:

**Conscientiousness: 2 (Low)** 

* **Rationale:** While the individual mentions being organized and dedicated to tasks, there are instances of struggling with focus and potential impulsivity. Phrases like "I have a kind of personality that I don't throw my work" and "I was working out from morning to you talk to if Talk of the night" suggest a drive but also a tendency to overwork without necessarily prioritizing structure or efficiency.  

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Rationale:** The responses indicate a willingness to engage in social settings, but also a degree of reservation. The individual describes feeling initially uncomfortable at a conference ("it was like for me because Office Depot after 5 or 10 minutes") and mentions feeling the need to analyze opinions in group discussions. This suggests a moderate level of comfort with social interaction, leaning towards introversion.


**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a very limited sample of responses. A comprehensive personality assessment would require a much broader range of questions and measures.
