Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a tendency towards meticulousness and a desire for accuracy, as seen in their tutoring experience and careful preparation. They also express anxiety about making mistakes, highlighting a strong sense of responsibility and self-discipline. While they admit to being tempted to lie for personal gain, their fear of being caught and the potential harm to their reputation suggests a strong internal moral compass and a desire to act ethically.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual consistently describes themselves as introverted and prefers solitary activities. They express discomfort in social situations, particularly with unfamiliar people. They also mention avoiding conflict and finding it difficult to initiate conversations. These behaviors align with a low extraversion score. While they express a desire to help friends and acknowledge the importance of relationships, their overall preference for solitude and discomfort in social settings point towards a lower extraversion.
