Here's an analysis of the personality ratings based on the provided answers:

**Conscientiousness: 2 (Medium)** 

* **Supporting Evidence:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for accuracy and thoroughness in their work ("even being off by one penny... can mess up everything..."). They value doing things correctly the first time and take pride in their attention to detail.  While they show a willingness to take charge in certain situations (e.g., seeking the committee position), this doesn't necessarily indicate a consistently high level of conscientiousness.

* **Counter-Evidence:** There are instances where they express a desire to "skip after-work social events" and prioritize personal time over social interaction, which could be seen as slightly less conscientious in terms of work-life balance.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Supporting Evidence:** The individual describes themselves as "a little bit quieter" but capable of being "outgoing" in social situations when needed. They enjoy group discussions and are comfortable taking both leading and listening roles. They also organized a team outing to boost morale.

* **Counter-Evidence:**  They express a preference for quiet time after work and indicate that networking events aren't always their favorite.  This suggests a moderate level of extraversion rather than a strong preference for social interaction.
