Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates some conscientiousness. They show attention to detail in the escape room example and self-discipline while training for the Spartan race. They also express ambition and a desire to advance in their career. However, their description of disorganization when setting up equipment suggests room for improvement in this area.  The rating leans towards medium due to these mixed indicators.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual exhibits mixed tendencies regarding extraversion. While they express discomfort in social situations initially (like the fraternity pledge meeting), they later demonstrate willingness to participate in group discussions and social events. They also seem capable of raising team morale and connecting with colleagues. The overall impression suggests a moderate level of extraversion, making the rating "medium."
