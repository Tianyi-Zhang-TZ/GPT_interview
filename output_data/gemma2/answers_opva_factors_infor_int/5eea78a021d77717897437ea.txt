Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail (as seen in answers to questions 2, 6, and 8), there's also a willingness to delegate and recognize when others might be better suited for a task (question 4). This suggests a balanced approach to conscientiousness rather than being overly driven or rigid. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual enjoys social interactions in specific contexts (academic conferences, group discussions) but also acknowledges a preference for quieter activities and limited after-work socializing (questions 1, 3, 5, and 7). This indicates a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion in some situations. The desire to start conversations and contribute meaningfully to discussions suggests a comfort level in social settings when there's a shared purpose or intellectual stimulation.
