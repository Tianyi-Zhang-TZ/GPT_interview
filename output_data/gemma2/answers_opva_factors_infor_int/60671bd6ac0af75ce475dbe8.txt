Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Explanation:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates some conscientiousness in their work approach (paying attention to detail, following procedures), they also show a tendency to rely on others for verification and struggle with taking initiative in situations requiring quick action.  This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual seems somewhat comfortable in social situations, even if they prefer smaller groups. They express a willingness to participate in social events and offer support to colleagues. However, they don't appear to be highly outgoing or actively seek out social interaction. This points towards a medium level of extraversion.
