Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a good balance of  organization, attention to detail, and a desire to complete tasks successfully. They express a tendency to follow rules and regulations, suggesting a level of conscientiousness. However, there are also indications of  occasional anxiety and a preference to work within their comfort zone, which might suggest a slightly lower level of conscientiousness if pushed consistently outside their comfort zone.
* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally reserved and preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions. They also express discomfort in social situations with unfamiliar people and  a reluctance to put themselves out there socially. However, they do make an effort to be positive and supportive within their team and sometimes enjoy social events after initial hesitation. This suggests a medium level of extraversion, leaning towards the introverted side.
