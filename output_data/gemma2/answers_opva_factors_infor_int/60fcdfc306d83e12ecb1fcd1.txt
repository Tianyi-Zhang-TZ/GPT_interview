Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a mixed approach to conscientiousness. While they express a desire to be organized and complete tasks thoroughly (questions 2, 6, and 8), they also acknowledge a tendency towards impulsivity and acting on urges (question 8). This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness rather than consistently high or low.

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as outgoing, enjoying social situations, and comfortable initiating conversations (questions 1, 3, 5, and 7). They also express a preference for social interaction with coworkers and engaging in after-work activities. These responses point towards a high level of extraversion.
