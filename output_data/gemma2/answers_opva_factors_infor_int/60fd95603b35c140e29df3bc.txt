Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with low conscientiousness. They express a preference for order and organization but admit to cleaning up others' messes and not liking to pass off work. While these actions might seem conscientious, they also suggest a lack of strong initiative and a tendency to be reactive rather than proactive. Their response about carefully considering consequences before acting, while generally positive,  hints at a potential for being overly cautious and less driven by a need for achievement or completion.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual shows a mixed bag of extraversion-related behaviors. While they describe themselves as shy and uncomfortable in new social situations, they also actively seek out networking opportunities and display leadership qualities in group discussions. They even admit to being a support and keeping team morale high during difficult times. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion ¨C capable of engaging socially but preferring less intense or large-scale interactions.
