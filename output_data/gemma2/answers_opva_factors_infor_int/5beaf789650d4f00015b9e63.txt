**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, planning, and attention to detail (e.g., putting things back in place, focusing on details when sealing diplomas). They also display a tendency to reflect before acting impulsively and prefer breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps. While they don't explicitly mention striving for achievement or perfectionism, their focus on accuracy and systematic approach leans towards medium conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual enjoys social interactions and seeks out connections with colleagues. They describe themselves as a "people person" and value spending time with others. However, they also mention preferring smaller, more intimate gatherings and sometimes needing solitude.  They seem comfortable leading in group discussions but also value listening and learning from others.  This suggests a preference for social connection but also a recognition of the importance of balance, pointing towards medium extraversion.
