Here's a personality rating based on the provided responses, keeping in mind the limitations of assessing personality solely from brief, open-ended answers:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Support:** The individual demonstrates an awareness of the importance of order and completion (e.g., putting equipment away). They also express a preference for thoroughness in tasks and a desire to avoid mistakes. However, the responses lack a strong emphasis on planning, organization, or self-discipline, which would point to high conscientiousness.

* **Mixed Signals:** The response about wanting something badly at work and potentially acting impulsively suggests a degree of flexibility and perhaps a willingness to take risks, which could be seen as somewhat counter to high conscientiousness.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Support:** The individual acknowledges situations where they feel comfortable or uncomfortable in social settings, indicating some awareness of their social preferences.  They also mention enjoying social events when colleagues are relaxed and describe themselves as someone who tries to raise spirits.

* **Mixed Signals:** The answers don't reveal a strong preference for social interaction or leadership roles. There's a sense of going with the flow and adapting to social situations rather than actively seeking them out.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Limited Data:** These brief responses provide a very limited snapshot of personality. 
* **Cultural Influences:**  It's important to be aware that cultural norms can significantly influence how people respond to these types of questions.
* **Subjectivity:** Personality assessment always involves some degree of subjectivity. Different psychologists might interpret these responses slightly differently.
