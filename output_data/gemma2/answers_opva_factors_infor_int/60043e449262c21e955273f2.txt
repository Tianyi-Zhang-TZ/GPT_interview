## Personality Rating Based on HEXCO Model

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

While the individual demonstrates some planning and goal-setting tendencies (Question 2),  responses like "I tend to shy away from" (Question 1) and "Daily activities by 2" (Question 4) suggest a level of  disorganization and inconsistency in approach.  The answers lack a strong emphasis on detail-orientation and careful execution characteristic of high conscientiousness. 

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

The individual seems to exhibit some comfort in leading and sharing experiences (Question 3), but also mentions shying away from social situations (Question 1).  The responses to Questions 5 and 7 indicate a mixed approach to social interaction, suggesting a tendency towards moderate extraversion rather than a strong preference for social engagement.
