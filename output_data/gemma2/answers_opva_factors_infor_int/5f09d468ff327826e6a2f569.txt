Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates careful planning, a focus on order and organization, and a commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. Examples include: putting equipment away meticulously, taking detailed notes during a repair, and prioritizing planning over impulsiveness. These actions suggest a preference for structure and careful execution, leaning towards a lower Conscientiousness score.

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes engaging in social activities, their responses indicate a preference for personal space and boundaries. They often choose to observe and listen in group discussions, prioritize professional-personal separation, and admit to discomfort in unfamiliar social situations.  This suggests a preference for controlled social interaction rather than actively seeking out and leading social engagement, resulting in a medium Extraversion score.
