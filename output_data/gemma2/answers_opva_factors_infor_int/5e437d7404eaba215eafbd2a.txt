Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

While the individual displays some traits consistent with both high conscientiousness and extraversion, there's a noticeable balance throughout their responses.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a clear understanding of rules and procedures, striving for accuracy and completion of tasks. However, there are instances where they acknowledge bending rules (the coffee example). This suggests a level of conscientiousness that's present but not rigid or overly controlling.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual seems adaptable in social situations, shifting their personality based on the context. While they express discomfort in unfamiliar settings, they actively participate in group discussions and seek opportunities to connect with colleagues outside work. This indicates a willingness to engage socially but not necessarily a constant high level of extroversion.


Overall, the individual seems to possess a balanced personality with moderate levels of both conscientiousness and extraversion.
