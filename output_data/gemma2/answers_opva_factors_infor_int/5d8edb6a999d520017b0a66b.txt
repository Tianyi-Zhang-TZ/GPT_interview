Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Here's why:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates a strong desire for organization and efficiency, there are instances where they mention  accommodating others' work styles (like cleaning up after colleagues) or feeling overwhelmed by challenging tasks.  This suggests a level of conscientiousness that is present but not always consistently applied.

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as comfortable in social situations due to their work experience. They also exhibit a willingness to take charge in group settings and enjoy social interaction with coworkers. However, they don't express a strong need for constant social stimulation or a preference for large gatherings. This points towards a moderate level of extraversion.
