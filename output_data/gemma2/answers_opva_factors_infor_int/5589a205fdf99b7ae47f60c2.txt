Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates some conscientiousness by prioritizing organization, avoiding inconvenience, and being hardworking, several responses indicate a tendency to avoid direct action and a preference for reflection and planning.  Phrases like "I would try to... reasons... would be more or less effective" and "I would double-check, so I guess which I really don't have a problem" suggest a cautious and deliberative approach, rather than impulsive action.

* **Extraversion:**  The responses reveal a mixed picture. The individual acknowledges discomfort in unfamiliar social situations and expresses a preference for getting to know people gradually.  However, they also demonstrate a willingness to participate in discussions, contribute to group work, and raise team spirits, indicating a moderate level of social engagement. The overall tone suggests a preference for controlled social interactions rather than outgoing assertiveness.
