Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

While the individual demonstrates some traits of both high conscientiousness and extraversion, the answers suggest a balance rather than a strong leaning in either direction.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays  organized behavior, a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a commitment to ethical conduct. These are all hallmarks of conscientiousness. However, there's no indication of extreme perfectionism or rigid adherence to rules.

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "in-between" introvert and extrovert, enjoying both social interaction and solitude. They actively seek to engage in social situations, but also acknowledge the importance of personal space and downtime. This suggests a comfortable medium level of extraversion.
