Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates several traits associated with conscientiousness. They express a strong desire for order, organization, and accuracy in their work (inventory control, food cost management, attention to detail).  They are also described as a perfectionist and driven to complete tasks correctly. However, there are also instances where impulsivity and a desire to get what they want (smoking despite instructions) suggest a less rigid adherence to rules and expectations. This balance of conscientious and less conscientious tendencies points to a medium rating. 

* **Extraversion:** While the individual describes themselves as outgoing and sporty, they also exhibit traits of shyness and social anxiety in certain situations (discomfort in unfamiliar social settings, initial hesitation to join social events). They prefer to observe and assess before actively engaging.  The individual's efforts to cheer up their team and their playful nature also suggest some extraversion. Overall, their social behavior leans more towards a medium level of extraversion.
