Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1

**Explanation:**

Based on the answers provided, the individual demonstrates a balance between conscientiousness and extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual shows a good level of organization, attention to detail, and a tendency to follow instructions and complete tasks thoroughly. They prioritize work and demonstrate self-discipline in managing their time and desires (e.g., skipping the social event to focus on work). However, they don't necessarily seem to exhibit a strong drive for perfectionism or a need for control that would indicate a high level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** While the individual mentions feeling timid initially in unfamiliar social situations, they ultimately show a willingness to engage and build relationships. They describe taking on leadership roles in group discussions and offering encouragement to team members. However, they also clearly prioritize work over social events and seem content with socializing outside of work hours. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion rather than a high or low preference for social interaction.
