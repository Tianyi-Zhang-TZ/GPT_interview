Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1

**Explanation:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a good balance between being organized and detail-oriented while also showing flexibility and collaboration when needed. They value rules and procedures but can adapt when necessary. Examples include their meticulous note-taking during their internship and their willingness to collaborate with more experienced colleagues.  

* **Extraversion:** While the individual mentions discomfort in unfamiliar social settings initially, they actively seek to overcome this by putting themselves out there and building relationships.  They also seem comfortable taking on leadership roles when needed but are also capable of listening and supporting others. Their decision to join the after-work social event despite a demanding workload suggests a desire for social connection. 



The responses indicate a moderate level of conscientiousness and extraversion, leaning slightly towards the medium range.
