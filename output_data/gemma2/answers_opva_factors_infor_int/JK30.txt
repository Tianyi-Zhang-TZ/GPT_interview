Here's a personality rating based on the provided responses, using the HEXCO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates some conscientiousness by acknowledging the importance of order and organization at work. They describe themselves as a "go-getter" and striving to achieve goals. However, they also admit to procrastination and difficulty with detail-oriented tasks. This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness, not consistently high but with some effort towards organization and achievement.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:** The individual enjoys social situations and meeting new people. They describe themselves as open-minded and willing to engage with others.  However, they also mention shyness initially and a tendency to overindulge at social events. This indicates a moderate level of extraversion -  they enjoy social interaction but may not always be the most outgoing or dominant personality.
