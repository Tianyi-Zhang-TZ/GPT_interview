Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They value order, accuracy, and completing tasks thoroughly. They describe themselves as someone who likes to get things done the right way and pays attention to detail. However, they also acknowledge that they sometimes ask for help when facing particularly challenging tasks, indicating a willingness to seek support when needed, which might suggest a slightly less rigid approach than someone scoring high on conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual seems to possess a moderate level of extraversion. They enjoy social events and interacting with new people, though they also acknowledge situations where they prefer to listen and include everyone's voices. Their willingness to lead in group discussions but also emphasize inclusivity suggests a balanced approach to social interaction, rather than an overly dominant or reserved personality.
