Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a clear preference for order, planning, and attention to detail. They express a desire to do things correctly the first time, meticulously follow instructions, and take pride in their work's accuracy.  While they acknowledge their tendency to be "overachievers," this points towards a strong conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual exhibits a mixed picture regarding extraversion. While they admit to feeling shy and uncomfortable in new social situations, they also show willingness to step outside their comfort zone in Toastmasters, participate in events, and even attempt to comfort their boss.  This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the medium range.
