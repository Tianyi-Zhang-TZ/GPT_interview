**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
* **Evidence:**  The answers suggest some level of organization and self-control. The individual mentions putting things back in place and wanting to avoid mistakes. However, there are also instances of impulsivity (wanting candy, not finishing tasks) and a lack of focus on details at times. 

**Extraversion: 0 (Low)**
* **Evidence:** The answers consistently indicate a preference for solitude and a discomfort in social situations. The individual mentions feeling drained in large groups and prioritizing family time over social events. They also appear to be content with staying away from social gatherings.
