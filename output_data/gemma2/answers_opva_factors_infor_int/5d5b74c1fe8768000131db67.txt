Here's a personality rating based on the provided responses, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates some conscientiousness by mentioning a tendency to organize things (video camera) and pay attention to detail in their work. However, they also admit to struggles with tasks requiring meticulousness and impulsivity in pursuing their goals (authoring a paper). 

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:** The individual describes themselves as a bit shy and preferring to observe in social situations.  They express a desire to be more outgoing but don't always succeed. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They also mention enjoying social events like baseball games but don't seem to actively seek them out.

**Important Note:** These ratings are based on limited self-reported information. A more comprehensive assessment would involve additional questions, standardized scales, and potentially observations in real-world settings.
