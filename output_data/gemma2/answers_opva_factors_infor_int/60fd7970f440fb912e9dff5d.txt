Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 0

**Rationale:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits associated with low conscientiousness. They describe themselves as taking on challenging tasks partly because they doubt others' capabilities, indicating a possible lack of organization and delegation. They also admit to sometimes needing to reiterate details to themselves due to fear of forgetting, suggesting potential challenges with planning and focus. While they strive to be meticulous in certain areas like payroll, their overall descriptions lean towards a preference for action over meticulous planning.

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations with unfamiliar people. They actively seek smaller, more intimate gatherings and describe themselves as introverted and a "wallflower." Their descriptions of group discussions and social events highlight a preference for listening and observing rather than taking a leading role. This pattern strongly suggests a low level of extraversion.
