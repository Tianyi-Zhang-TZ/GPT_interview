Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a balance between responsibility and flexibility.  They show a tendency to follow through on tasks (making lemonade, paying attention to detail in a complex drink), but also acknowledge the importance of listening and learning from others (taking notes during the drink-making process).  Their impulse control regarding the free drinks suggests awareness of potential boundaries.
* **Extraversion:** The individual appears comfortable in social situations, even when unfamiliar.  They actively seek to connect with others (starting conversations, joining the after-work social event), but also demonstrate self-awareness in their approach (not dominating discussions, stepping back when needed). This suggests a balanced approach to social engagement rather than being solely outgoing or withdrawn.
