Here's a personality rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
* **Support:** The individual demonstrates a preference for order and organization ("I tend to be a rather tidy person"). They acknowledge the importance of attention to detail ("when a task requires to pay attention to a little details, I have to put aside this multitasking binging..."). However, there are instances where they express a comfort with multitasking and a focus on the bigger picture, suggesting a moderate level of conscientiousness.

* **Caution:** The individual doesn't explicitly express strong drive for achievement or goal-setting, which are often associated with high conscientiousness. Their willingness to delegate tasks based on expertise ("So I think that I tend to pass the top someone who is more prepared than me") might also indicate a slightly lower conscientiousness. 

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**
* **Support:** The individual describes themselves as "rather outgoing" and comfortable in social settings, even if they sometimes avoid them. They enjoy taking a leading role in discussions when prepared ("If I am well-prepared, I mean I know what the discussion is about, I really like to take a leading role").  

* **Caution:** They express a preference for separating work and social time, suggesting a moderate need for social interaction. Their description of after-work events as potentially disruptive to their productivity further supports a medium level of extraversion.
