Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates careful planning, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. They describe themselves as thorough, methodical, and driven to complete tasks correctly. While they acknowledge occasional lapses due to time constraints, their general approach reflects a high level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual identifies as an introvert and expresses some discomfort in social situations. However, they also recognize the importance of social interaction and actively seek to participate in group discussions and after-work events despite their personal preference. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, where they are willing to step outside their comfort zone when necessary.
