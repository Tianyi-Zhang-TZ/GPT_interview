**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates a clear awareness of the importance of detail and organization in their work as a cake decorator. They mention taking the time to read orders carefully, double-checking for allergies, and striving for customer satisfaction.  They also describe a willingness to put in extra effort when facing challenges at work.
* **However:**  The individual doesn't consistently display traits like planning or adherence to rules. Their decision to ask for a raise impulsively suggests a lack of careful deliberation.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**
* **Evidence:** The individual seems open to social situations but expresses a preference for not being the center of attention. They describe feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings initially but eventually pushing themselves to engage.  They also mention being willing to support colleagues and raise their spirits, demonstrating some social sensitivity.
* **However:** Their responses often focus on pragmatic reasons for social engagement (compassion, helping a coworker), rather than purely enjoyment. They don't express a strong desire to be the life of the party or constantly seek social interaction.
