Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual describes themselves as a perfectionist and someone who pushes themselves to complete tasks meticulously, they also mention instances where they struggle with small details and can get frustrated. This suggests a level of conscientiousness that is present but not always consistently high.  Their willingness to ask for help when needed also points towards a less rigid approach to getting things done, leaning towards a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a preference for smaller, quieter social interactions and avoids large group settings. They describe themselves as reserved and shy. While they acknowledge the importance of relationships and are willing to engage in one-on-one conversations, their overall discomfort with large social events and tendency to listen rather than lead in group discussions indicate a medium level of extraversion.
