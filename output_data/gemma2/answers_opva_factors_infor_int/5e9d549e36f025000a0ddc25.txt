Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They express a sense of responsibility in their past work experiences, prioritizing organization and completion of tasks. However, they also mention feeling overwhelmed and tired by workload at times, suggesting that their conscientiousness might not always be consistently high.

* **Extraversion:** The individual appears to have a moderate level of extraversion. They enjoy social interaction with colleagues but prefer to keep work and personal life separate. They don't actively seek out social events after work and describe themselves as not very "outgoing."  While they can be a leader and supportive of team members, their preference for solitude suggests a moderate level of extraversion rather than a high one.
