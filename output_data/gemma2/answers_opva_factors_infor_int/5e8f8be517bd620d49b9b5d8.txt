Here's an assessment based on the provided answers:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Mixed Signals:** The individual demonstrates some conscientious behaviors (cleaning up after work, pushing through a difficult task) but also exhibits impulsivity (taking a task others might avoid, potentially feeling guilty after acting on an impulse). This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Empathy Drives Interaction:** While the individual expresses some discomfort in new social situations, they actively seek to engage and initiate conversation. Their willingness to attend a work event despite not wanting to, driven by empathy for the host, also points towards extraversion. However, their preference for listening and concise speaking in group discussions suggests a less outgoing nature than someone scoring high in extraversion.
