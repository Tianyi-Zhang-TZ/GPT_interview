Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0 

**Why:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a mixed bag of conscientiousness. While they express a desire to do things properly and a tendency to get flustered when tasks are challenging, they also admit to struggling with paying attention to detail and sometimes feeling overwhelmed by the need to perform.  This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.
* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as introverted and uncomfortable in social situations with unfamiliar people. They express a preference for solitude and often feel anxious in group settings.  Their humor seems to be more of an internal coping mechanism rather than a drive to be the center of attention.  This points towards a low level of extraversion.
