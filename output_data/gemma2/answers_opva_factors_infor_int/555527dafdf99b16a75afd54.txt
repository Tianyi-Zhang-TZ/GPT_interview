Extraversion: 0 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The answers demonstrate a clear pattern of organized, detail-oriented behavior and a tendency to follow through on commitments. The individual describes themselves as tidy, meticulous, and dedicated to completing tasks thoroughly.  While there are instances of enthusiasm and passion, the emphasis is consistently on careful planning and execution.

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses enjoyment in social situations and describes themselves as outgoing, their actions often focus on building connections strategically rather than seeking out social interaction purely for enjoyment.  There's a strong emphasis on contributing meaningfully to discussions and fostering positive relationships within a professional context. The answers don't strongly suggest a preference for excitement, dominance, or a need for constant stimulation that is characteristic of high extraversion.
