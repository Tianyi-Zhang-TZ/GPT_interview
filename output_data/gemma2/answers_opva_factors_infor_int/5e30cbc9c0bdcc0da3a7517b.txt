Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits of carefulness, organization, and a focus on detail.  They describe themselves as taking pride in doing things correctly, being meticulous in their work, and  avoiding mistakes. While there are hints of impulsive behavior in their personal life, their work-related descriptions clearly point towards a conscientious personality.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual seems to exhibit a mix of extroverted and introverted tendencies. While they describe enjoying socializing and forming friendships after overcoming initial shyness, they also express a preference for listening over leading in group discussions and demonstrate some reservation towards attending social events, especially those they aren't familiar with. This mixed presentation suggests a medium level of extraversion.
