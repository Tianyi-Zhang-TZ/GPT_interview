Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a preference for carefulness, organization, and thoroughness. They prioritize accuracy and detail, even when dealing with sensitive information.  Their reluctance to act impulsively and preference for thoughtful evaluation also point towards a higher conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** While the individual occasionally describes themselves as "outgoing" and able to lead discussions, they also express a preference for solitude and a tendency to withdraw in social situations. They acknowledge discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and sometimes decline after-work events due to other commitments. These behaviors suggest a moderate level of extraversion rather than a high one.
