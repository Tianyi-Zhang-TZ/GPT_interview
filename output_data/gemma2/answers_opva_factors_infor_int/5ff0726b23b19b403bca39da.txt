Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 0 

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a strong preference for order, planning, and thoroughness. They enjoy detailed tasks, take pride in accuracy, and think things through carefully before acting. Examples include their response to the equipment question, where they express frustration at disorganization, and their description of meticulously checking details. Their inclination to plan and anticipate consequences in work situations also points towards high conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** While the individual acknowledges they are introverted and prefer solitude, their responses suggest they can be adaptable in social situations. They describe strategies for managing social interactions and even taking on a leadership role when prepared.  However, they consistently express disinterest in socializing outside work and prefer focusing on personal goals. Their lack of enthusiasm for spontaneous social events and small talk, coupled with their preference for solitude, points towards a low extraversion score.
