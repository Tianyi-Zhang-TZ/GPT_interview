Here's a personality rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXCO model:

**Conscientiousness: 2 (Low)** 

* **Rationale:**  While the individual mentions being organized and detail-oriented in some instances (e.g., their past accounting work), there are also indications of being less driven by careful planning and impulse control.  Phrases like "I tend to be someone who will finish a task regardless of how challenging it is" and "I'm not someone who acts on impulse ever" suggest a  willingness to approach tasks without meticulous pre-planning.  

**Extraversion: 2 (Low)**

* **Rationale:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social settings where they don't know people, describes themselves as "shy," and prefers staying home. They also indicate a preference for listening over leading in group discussions. These responses point to a lower level of extraversion. 



**Important Note:**  These ratings are based on a limited set of self-reported answers. A comprehensive personality assessment would involve more diverse questions and potentially standardized tests to provide a more accurate and nuanced understanding.
