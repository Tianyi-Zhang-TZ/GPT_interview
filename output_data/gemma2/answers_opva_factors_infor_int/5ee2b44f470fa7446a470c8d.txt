Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a tendency towards carefulness and organization in several situations. They prioritize completing tasks thoroughly, value leaving things in order, and demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility towards their work. However,  instances like the gift card theft reveal a hesitation to directly confront conflict, suggesting a preference for more indirect approaches.  This indicates a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses a desire to be bubbly and make others feel comfortable, they also display a preference for solitude and avoid engaging in excessive social interactions. Their preference for working efficiently and focusing on tasks over socializing, and their reluctance to join after-work events point towards a medium level of extraversion. They enjoy social interactions in a controlled setting but aren't actively seeking out external stimulation.
