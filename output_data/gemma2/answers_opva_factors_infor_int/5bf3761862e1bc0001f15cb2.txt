Conscientiousness: 2 (Low) 
Extraversion: 2 (Low)

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual displays some conscientious traits (perfectionism, meticulousness, aversion to mistakes), there are also indications of tendencies that contradict this trait. They mention feeling agitated by not being able to set things "correctly," suggesting potential inflexibility and a tendency to be overwhelmed by minor details. Their reluctance to pass on tasks and preference for handling them alone, even when challenging, could also point towards a need for control rather than a high level of organization and planning. 
* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as shy, introverted, and uncomfortable in social settings. They actively avoid after-work socializing, find social interactions draining, and gravitate towards listening roles in discussions. These responses strongly suggest a preference for solitude and limited social engagement.

Overall, the responses point towards a personality that leans towards introversion and exhibits some conscientious traits but lacks the strong organizational and disciplined behaviors characteristic of high conscientiousness.
