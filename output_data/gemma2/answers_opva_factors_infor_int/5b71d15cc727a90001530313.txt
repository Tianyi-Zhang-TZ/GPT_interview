**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)**

They describe themselves as putting things back in place after use and paying attention to detail to avoid mistakes. However, their response to wanting something badly at work suggests they might not always prioritize immediate action and consider the consequences, hinting at a medium level of conscientiousness.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:** The individual seems to prefer listening over leading in group discussions and weighs the pros and cons of social events before deciding. While they might gradually open up in social settings, they don't seem to actively seek them out.

* **Example:** "most of the time  I would rather be in a listening role. I would only choose to be on the leading role after being in a listening role or sometime.  Just because I feel that.  I learned things that way you can learn things about the people you're working with Norm things about the situation.  discover  wheezing what you want to approach the other project or whatever it is you're taking part in.  if you listen to that once you get  comfortable with the situation then I'm I feel like  we're leaving with it probably would never be a conscious decision."
