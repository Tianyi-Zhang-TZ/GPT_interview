Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of low conscientiousness. They express a preference for leaving tasks undone ("unless it was a very extreme case"), a tendency to prioritize ease over organization ("I wouldn't usually just leave it aside for someone else"), and a reluctance to act impulsively. Their answers emphasize a desire to avoid discomfort or unnecessary effort.
* **Extraversion:** While the individual acknowledges feeling more comfortable in social settings with known individuals, they also demonstrate a willingness to engage and analyze discussions.  They show a preference for listening over leading in group settings but are open to contributing when necessary. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, falling somewhere between a strong introvert and an extrovert.
