Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1 

**Here's why:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual describes themselves as organized and detail-oriented in some instances, but also expresses anxiety and discomfort when focusing on minutiae. Their response to the "impulse" question suggests a strong moral compass and aversion to unethical behavior, which aligns with conscientiousness.  Overall, they exhibit a moderate level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual identifies as an introvert and prefers listening in group discussions, they also acknowledge being the "life of the party" with friends and enjoying social situations. Their willingness to engage in conversation even when feeling uncomfortable in new social settings points to a moderate level of extraversion. They seem comfortable with social interaction under certain conditions.
