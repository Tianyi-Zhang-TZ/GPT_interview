Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates thoughtful, organized, and responsible behavior. They value accuracy, planning, and taking initiative. Examples include meticulously double-checking payments, seeking clarification when keys are missing, and carefully navigating workload changes during staff shortages. While they are collaborative, their primary focus seems to be on completing tasks diligently and meeting expectations.  

* **Extraversion:**  The individual appears to be introverted or at least ambiverted. They express comfort in social situations but prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions. They are attentive listeners and contribute thoughtfully to discussions but don't appear to be the primary driver of social engagement. They also prioritize work-life balance and set boundaries regarding after-work socializing.
