Here's an assessment of the personality score based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

While the individual expresses a desire to be organized and complete tasks, there are also indications of struggle with details and following through consistently. Phrases like "I always forget something that takes a lot of detail" and "Figure it out, but it's not the first try" suggest some inconsistency in conscientiousness.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

The responses indicate a tendency towards both introversion and extraversion.  There's a willingness to engage socially and be the center of attention ("confident and very funny," "always end up saying my thoughts"), but also a preference for quiet and avoiding social events ("I don't tend to go...hardly," "nervous, scared other things"). This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.
