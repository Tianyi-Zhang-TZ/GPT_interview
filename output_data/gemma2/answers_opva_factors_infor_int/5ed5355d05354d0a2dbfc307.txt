Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

The provided answers are largely incoherent and lack the structured self-reflection typical of someone describing their personality traits.  

* **Conscientiousness:** While some answers hint at a desire for order ("put everything back in place") and frustration with challenges ("push myself to do that tripod"), there's no consistent pattern suggesting high conscientiousness. The lack of coherent thought suggests a medium level.
* **Extraversion:**  The answers occasionally touch on social situations, but they lack depth and clarity regarding how the individual feels or behaves in those settings.  The disjointed nature of the responses suggests a medium level of extraversion.

**Important Note:**  It is crucial to remember that these ratings are highly speculative based on extremely limited and fragmented data. A proper personality assessment would require much more structured and comprehensive responses.
