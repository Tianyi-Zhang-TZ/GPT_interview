Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, detail-orientation, and following through on tasks.  Words like "tenacious," "practical," "cross every t," and "managing details" frequently appear in their responses. While they are thoughtful and contemplative, they don't shy away from hard work or challenges.

* **Extraversion:**  The responses show a mixed picture. While they enjoy leading discussions in smaller groups and engaging in thoughtful conversations, they also admit to feeling uncomfortable in large social situations and preferring to observe. They are willing to participate in social events with close colleagues but tend to decline invitations from those they don't know well. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.
