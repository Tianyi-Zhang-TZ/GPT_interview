Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a tendency towards being organized and detail-oriented. They highlight instances where they carefully followed procedures, prioritized accuracy, and acknowledged the importance of planning and attention to detail. However, there are also moments where they struggle with organization and impulsivity, like forgetting to return equipment or needing help with technical issues. This suggests a middling level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as not being very talkative and preferring to listen in group settings. They also seem to avoid social situations where they don't know anyone well. However, they do acknowledge the importance of social interaction and seek out companionship with colleagues. This suggests a preference for quieter social interactions and a level of extraversion that falls in the middle ground.
