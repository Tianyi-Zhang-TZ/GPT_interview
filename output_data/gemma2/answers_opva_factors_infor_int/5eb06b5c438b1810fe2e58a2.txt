Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They express a desire to be organized, complete tasks thoroughly, and consider the impact of their actions on others. However, they also admit to feeling nervous in detail-oriented situations, suggesting that their conscientiousness isn't always automatic or effortless. 

* **Extraversion:**  The individual falls in the middle ground for extraversion. While they acknowledge feeling initially shy in social settings and prefer to observe, they make an effort to engage with people at work events and actively listen during group discussions. Their willingness to participate in social situations, even if initially uncomfortable, indicates a moderate level of extraversion.
