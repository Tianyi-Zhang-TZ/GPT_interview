Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail in several scenarios (Questions 2, 6, 8), there are also instances where impulsivity plays a role (Question 8). The willingness to self-fund a trip despite potential conflict with superiors and the focus on personal growth suggest a level of conscientiousness that leans towards the medium range.

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as preferring to be in the corner at social gatherings (Question 1), yet also actively engages and interacts with others.  They show comfort leading and facilitating discussions (Question 3) and taking initiative to improve team morale (Question 7). This mix of introverted preferences and extroverted behaviors indicates a medium level of extraversion.
