Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual acknowledges challenges with organization (ADHD), they demonstrate efforts to develop systems and a dedication to completing tasks thoroughly. They value challenges and strive for accuracy, especially in their work as a writer.  Their willingness to address feedback and "get in the weeds" of detail suggests a conscientious approach. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes past experiences with shyness but highlights a conscious effort to become more outgoing. They enjoy socializing with coworkers, leading discussions, and initiating contact with those who seem shy. They also express a desire to create comfortable atmospheres for group interactions. While not extreme, these behaviors point to a medium level of extraversion.
