Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 0 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual describes moments of anxiety and meticulousness in certain situations, they also express a general tendency towards organization and following procedures.  Their answer to Question 2 highlights their desire for order and completion, and their response to Question 6 demonstrates a willingness to learn and improve their attention to detail. This suggests a medium level of conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual repeatedly expresses discomfort in social situations, particularly when they are unfamiliar with others (Question 1) or when they are the center of attention (Question 3). They also indicate a preference for solitude over social events (Question 5) and a tendency to feel anxious in group settings. These responses point towards a low level of extraversion.
