Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual displays strong organizational skills and a dedication to completing tasks meticulously, they also admit to struggles with impulsivity and procrastination. The tendency to avoid easy routes and  the desire for self-improvement suggest a medium level of conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual expresses a preference for solitude and admits to not being the most sociable person. However, they recognize the importance of building relationships with colleagues and actively participate in work-related social events. They also demonstrate leadership qualities in professional settings. These mixed signals point to a medium level of extraversion.
