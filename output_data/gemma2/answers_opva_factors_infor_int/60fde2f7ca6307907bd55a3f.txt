Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates some conscientious traits (e.g., putting things back in place, trying to avoid mistakes, following instructions), their responses also reveal a tendency towards impulsivity (e.g., wanting something and acting on it without considering the consequences, feeling angry and wanting to quit a job due to perceived criticism). This mixed pattern suggests a medium level of conscientiousness.
* **Extraversion:**  The individual expresses nervousness in social situations and prefers to listen rather than lead in group discussions. However, they also show enjoyment in social events with coworkers and a willingness to be there for a colleague in need. This indicates a moderate level of extraversion. 


Overall, the individual appears to have a personality that leans towards a medium level of both conscientiousness and extraversion.
