Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They value completing tasks thoroughly, recognize their limitations (detail-orientation), and actively seek help when needed. They also display persistence in achieving their goals, as seen in the example of securing a TV for their classroom. However, they don't appear to be overly meticulous or rigid in their approach. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual shows a moderate level of extraversion. They enjoy social events and find fulfillment in conversation and connection. They also demonstrate a willingness to take on leadership roles in group discussions. However, they also express a preference for leaving social events early due to discomfort with excessive drinking and a desire for deeper, more meaningful interactions. This suggests a preference for social engagement on their own terms.
