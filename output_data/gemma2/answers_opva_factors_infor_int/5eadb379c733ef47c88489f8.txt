Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Rationale:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a good balance between  being organized, detail-oriented, and persistent. They describe themselves as "diligent," "organized," and "focused on small steps." They also acknowledge the importance of attention to detail and show a willingness to double-check their work. However, they also admit to sometimes getting impatient and losing focus, indicating they aren't always perfectly meticulous. This suggests a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual seems to enjoy social interactions and building relationships with colleagues. They describe themselves as "very social" and actively seek out opportunities to connect with people, even outside of work events.  They also express a desire to understand people's personalities and adapt their behavior accordingly.  However, they also mention feeling uncomfortable in new social situations and needing to build trust slowly, suggesting they may not be extremely outgoing. This points to a medium level of extraversion.
