Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual displays some conscientious traits like organization and attention to detail, their answers also reveal a tendency towards impulsivity (negotiating a raise without prior experience) and a desire for external validation (seeking approval through a promotion).  These aspects suggest a moderate level of conscientiousness rather than a high one.

* **Extraversion:** The individual clearly enjoys social interactions and actively seeks them out. They describe themselves as a leader and comfortable with public speaking. However, their initial hesitation in new social situations (the happy hour example) and tendency to focus on internal validation (the coworker's happiness) indicate a moderate level of extraversion rather than a high one.
