Here's a breakdown of the personality ratings based on the provided answers:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates awareness of the importance of being organized and meticulous ("my mom has always told me to try and put everything back..."). However, they also admit to struggles with following through consistently ("...it's always been quite a struggle...sometimes I forget to put things back...").  They acknowledge a tendency towards impulsivity ("...I am quite an impulsive person") and recognize the need to balance immediate desires with long-term goals. This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:** The individual clearly enjoys social interaction and thrives in discussions ("I enjoy discussions a lot...I feel like you need a certain amount of confidence..."). They describe themselves as extroverted and value networking. However, there's also an acknowledgment of potential downsides to their social nature: a tendency to overthink social situations ("...in situations where I don't know any other people I tend to be quite nervous..."), and occasional avoidance of events due to perceived effort ("...as a time approaches I start thinking of all the little bits and pieces of effort..."). This suggests a medium level of extraversion.
