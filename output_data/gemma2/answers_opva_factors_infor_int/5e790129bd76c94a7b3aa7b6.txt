Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They show a desire for accuracy and attention to detail ("Virgo star sign OCD perfectionist"), a preference for planning and organization ("I'll take a break. I'll come back to it. I will like to try to fix it myself before I ask for help"), and a willingness to put in effort to complete tasks successfully ("usually at the beginning of this kind of task really really eat you and I think the end of this sort of task I'm exhausted but I'm still exhausted"). However, they also express frustration when faced with challenging tasks and admit to sometimes needing a break or external help. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual exhibits a moderate level of extraversion. While they express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings ("I felt like I had a bull's-eye on my head") and sometimes prefer to listen rather than lead in group discussions, they also indicate a willingness to engage socially in specific contexts ("I do tell jokes..."). They seem to be somewhat introverted in large social gatherings but can be more outgoing in smaller, familiar settings. 



It's important to note that these are subjective ratings based on a limited set of responses. A more comprehensive assessment would require a wider range of questions and observations.
