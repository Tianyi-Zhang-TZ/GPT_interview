Based on the provided answers, here's a rating according to the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 2 (Medium)** 

The individual demonstrates a tendency towards organization and attention to detail (Questions 2, 6, 8). They value accuracy and completing tasks thoroughly. However, there's also an element of self-doubt expressed in some answers, suggesting that while they strive for conscientiousness, they might not always fully believe in their abilities. 

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

The individual seems to exhibit a mixed approach to social situations. While they express anxiety in unfamiliar social settings (Question 1), they also acknowledge the importance of connecting with coworkers (Questions 5, 7).  They are willing to step outside their comfort zone when they believe it's beneficial (Questions 5, 7), but their overall comfort level in social situations appears to be moderate.
