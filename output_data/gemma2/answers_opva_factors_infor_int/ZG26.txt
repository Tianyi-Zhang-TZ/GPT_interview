Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a willingness to be helpful and put things back in their place, some answers suggest a tendency towards rigidity and getting easily frustrated by distractions. Phrases like "very very rigorous," "very very detailed focused," and "it'll make me lay with me. It'll make me feel angry" indicate a possible preference for order and control that might border on being overly cautious. This leans towards a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual acknowledges being initially shy in unfamiliar social settings but actively seeks to engage and participate. They enjoy social events after work, describe themselves as "outgoing," and like to "talk to everyone" and "cheer for the whole team up." This points to a medium level of extraversion, as they demonstrate both comfort and engagement in social situations but may not always be the most boisterous or dominant personality.
