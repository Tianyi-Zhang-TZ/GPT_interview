Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

While the responses provide some insight, they are often fragmented and lack clear, direct answers.  

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual mentions instances of organizing equipment and paying attention to detail in Excel, suggesting some level of conscientiousness. However, there are also mentions of not being a "handyman" and struggling with a task that required precision. This inconsistency points to a medium level of conscientiousness. 
* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings but also mentions enjoying after-work social events and being able to lead in a training situation. These mixed responses suggest a medium level of extraversion.  


It's important to note that these ratings are based on limited and somewhat ambiguous information. A more comprehensive assessment would require a larger sample of responses and standardized measures.
