Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong organizational skills and a desire for accuracy and completion (questions 2, 4, 6, and 8), they also express a tendency towards thoughtfulness and deliberation before acting, suggesting a medium level of conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and initially uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations (question 1). However, they actively work to overcome this discomfort and seek connections.
