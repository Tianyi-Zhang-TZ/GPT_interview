Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail in their work as a pharmacist. They prioritize accuracy and efficiency, highlighting a conscientious approach. However, instances where they felt tempted to leave a challenging task or pass it off to someone else suggest a potential for wavering in their commitment when faced with difficulties. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as extroverted in their usual social circles. They enjoy being the center of attention and engaging in conversation. However, they also acknowledge instances where they felt uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and the need to listen rather than dominate a group discussion. This suggests a balanced level of extraversion, comfortable in familiar situations but potentially requiring more effort in less comfortable environments.
