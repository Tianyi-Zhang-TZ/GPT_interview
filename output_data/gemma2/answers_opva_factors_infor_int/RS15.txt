Here's an analysis based on the provided answers:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
The individual demonstrates awareness of the importance of organization and planning ("I try to think in terms of the future," "I do try to be very organized"). They also show a tendency to be careful and detail-oriented in tasks ("It's important for me to do things properly," "I tend to be more cautious than I usually am"). However, they also acknowledge moments of impulsivity ("Instead of just leaving my meeting, I was appointed to get an impulse at work") which suggests a balance between conscientiousness and less structured tendencies.

**Extraversion: 2 (High)**
The individual consistently expresses a strong preference for social interaction and engagement. They express feeling energized by being around people, enjoy leading in discussions, and actively seek out social events ("I love meeting new people," "I can't stand being alone"). Their desire to connect and contribute in social settings strongly points towards high extraversion.
