## Personality Rating based on HEXACO Model:

**Conscientiousness:** 1 (Medium) 
**Extraversion:** 0 (Low)

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness.  While they express a desire to be organized and efficient, there are instances where they struggle with this (e.g., dropping the online class). Their attention to detail in tasks like Prolific studies shows conscientiousness, but their impulsiveness regarding the shredded cheese suggests a lack of full self-control.

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social settings and avoids them unless they feel comfortable. They prefer solitary activities and don't appear to actively seek out social interaction. Their descriptions of themselves as "socially awkward" and preferring to "criticize things" rather than offer positive reinforcement further support this low extraversion rating.
