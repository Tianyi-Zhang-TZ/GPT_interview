Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 0 

**Here's why:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates several traits consistent with conscientiousness. They prioritize responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. Examples include:  
    * Returning equipment promptly and meticulously organizing it.
    * Focusing on their job even when in pain.
    * Being detail-oriented and focused while working on the award show.
    * Acting with loyalty and professionalism.
* **Extraversion:** While the individual shows moments of stepping outside their comfort zone (attending the Christmas party, leading the discussion), their overall self-description highlights shyness, timidity, and a preference for listening over leading. They often express anxiety in social situations and describe themselves as introverted.
