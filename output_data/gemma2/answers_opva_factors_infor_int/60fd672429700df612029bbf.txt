Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates both sides of conscientiousness. While they sometimes struggle with organization and detail (like in the backhoe scenario), they often prioritize thoroughness and following through (training, company information). This suggests a medium level of conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual seems to fluctuate between enjoying social interactions and preferring solitude. They describe feeling awkward and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations but also report having fun and connecting with coworkers at events. They sometimes take initiative to cheer up a colleague, but also mention wanting to avoid social events. This mixed behavior points towards a medium level of extraversion.
