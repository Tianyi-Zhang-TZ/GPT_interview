Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0 

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and order (putting things back in place after use), are detail-oriented (ensuring advertising spots are sent correctly), and exhibit a strong work ethic (putting in extra hours to meet deadlines).  They also demonstrate a tendency to plan and be strategic, as seen in their approach to asking for a raise. While not overly rigid, these behaviors suggest a moderate level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** While the individual enjoys meeting new people and participating in social situations, their responses often highlight a preference for close relationships and family over large social gatherings. They mention prioritizing their daughter's birthday over a work party and choosing to support a grieving coworker over attending a social event.  These choices, coupled with the lack of strong emphasis on being the center of attention or taking leading roles in discussions, point towards a lower level of extraversion.
