Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong attention to detail and a desire for thoroughness in tasks (questions 2, 6), they also express a tendency to avoid impulsive actions and carefully consider situations before acting (question 8). This indicates a level of conscientiousness that leans towards the medium range.

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as reserved in new social situations (question 1), preferring to observe and "feel out" the room before fully engaging. However, they also express enjoyment in social events when they know the people (question 5) and a willingness to raise team spirits in challenging situations (question 7). This suggests a level of extraversion that falls in the medium range, exhibiting both introverted and extroverted tendencies.
