Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While there are instances where the individual demonstrates conscientious behavior (e.g., taking initiative to clean, volunteering for tasks), there are also examples of passing on responsibility (e.g., delegating the unloading of the truck with the snakes) and not always adhering to instructions meticulously (e.g., the "read all instructions" test anecdote). This suggests a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual often mentions enjoyment in social situations and describes instances where they took the lead to boost team morale. However, they also express preference for solitude and not being overly engaged in social settings. This balance leans towards a medium level of extraversion.
