Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong focus on organization, detail, and following through on tasks.  They express a preference for completing what they start and strive for accuracy, as evident in examples like organizing their father's medications and carefully handling work materials.  While they occasionally acknowledge the need to compromise on perfection, their dedication to thoroughness is a clear indicator of high conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual appears to be moderately extroverted. They enjoy social settings and can become more involved in group discussions over time. However, they also express a preference for observing initially and taking time to feel comfortable before fully engaging.  They set boundaries in social situations and don't appear to be driven by a constant need for external stimulation. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.
