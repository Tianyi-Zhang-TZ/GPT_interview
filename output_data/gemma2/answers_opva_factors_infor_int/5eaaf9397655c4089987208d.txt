Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates a strong commitment to organization and completing tasks (questions 2, 6, and 8), there are instances where impulsivity and frustration lead to actions that might not be considered highly conscientious (question 8). The willingness to advocate for change and address issues directly suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness, rather than a highly organized and detail-oriented approach.

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mixture of social engagement and introverted tendencies. They seek out social connections and networking opportunities (questions 1, 5, 7), but also acknowledge a preference for solitude and focus when working (questions 2, 6). Their ability to both lead and listen in group discussions (question 3) further suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the ambiverted side.
