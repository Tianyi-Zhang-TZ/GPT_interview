Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates several traits consistent with medium conscientiousness.  They prioritize organization ("list maker," attention to detail), safety protocols, and following through on tasks. While they express a desire for self-reliance and taking initiative, they also acknowledge seeking help when needed.  Their example of advocating for a position change also shows a drive for achievement within structure. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays mixed tendencies. While they prefer observing in new social situations and value team harmony, they also express a willingness to step up and speak their mind when necessary.  They recognize the value of social connection, especially in a relaxed setting, but  aren't actively seeking out highly social events. This suggests a preference for quieter social interactions and a comfort level with both solitude and collaboration.
