Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Rationale:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with lower conscientiousness. They express a preference for organization and attention to detail, but also acknowledge potential impulsivity and a need for evaluation before acting. They describe themselves as sometimes easily jealous and needing time to process feelings before acting.  

* **Extraversion:** While the individual identifies as an introvert and mentions feeling initially shy in new social settings, they also express enjoyment in bonding with colleagues, actively listening in group discussions, and finding value in social events with familiar people. This suggests a medium level of extraversion, leaning towards a preference for close relationships and thoughtful social engagement rather than seeking out constant external stimulation.
