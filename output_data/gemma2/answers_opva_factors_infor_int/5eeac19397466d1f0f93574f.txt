Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Why:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a mix of conscientious behaviors. They value organization and putting things back in place, show dedication to finishing tasks (like the mixer lift), and pay attention to detail in surveys. However, they also admit to impulsively wanting to join projects and sometimes struggling to push through challenges. This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual seems comfortable in social situations but also mentions feeling isolated at times. They are willing to step into leading roles in discussions and enjoy socializing with coworkers. However, they also express hesitation to attend after-work events due to personal circumstances and living further away. This indicates a moderate level of extraversion.
