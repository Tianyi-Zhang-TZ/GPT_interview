Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 0

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  While the individual demonstrates a strong preference for organization and attention to detail, several responses indicate a preference for deliberate action over impulsive behavior. They carefully plan their steps to achieve goals and avoid rash decisions. This suggests a tendency towards carefulness and thoughtfulness rather than a high level of  "drivenness" or "explosiveness" often associated with high conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations, particularly unfamiliar ones. They describe themselves as "reserved" and prefer to observe rather than lead. They decline after-work social events and find large gatherings challenging. These statements point towards a preference for solitude and a lower tolerance for social stimulation, characteristic of low extraversion.
