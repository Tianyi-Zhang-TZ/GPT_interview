Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0

**Explanation:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They value organization and completing tasks meticulously, as evidenced by their descriptions of tidying up, double-checking details in their work, and striving to meet deadlines. However, they also acknowledge getting overwhelmed by detailed tasks and sometimes struggling with impulsivity. This suggests a middle ground between high conscientiousness (always striving for perfection) and low conscientiousness (more relaxed and less detail-oriented).

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays characteristics of low extraversion. They express discomfort in social settings where they don't know people, prefer smaller groups, and often hesitate to speak up in discussions. While they acknowledge enjoying social events and meeting new people, their actions suggest a preference for more reserved interactions and a general tendency to avoid being the center of attention.
