Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1 

**Here's why:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. They value thoroughness and accuracy in their work, as seen in their descriptions of managing spreadsheets, double-checking data, and prioritizing completion over impulsive reactions.  While they express some occasional discomfort with mundane tasks, their overall approach emphasizes careful planning and execution.

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a balanced approach to social situations. They acknowledge periods of social anxiety but actively work to overcome it by initiating interactions, participating in discussions, and building relationships. Their descriptions suggest a willingness to engage socially, particularly in structured environments like group projects or work events, but they also seem to value time alone and personal space. This suggests a medium level of extraversion.
