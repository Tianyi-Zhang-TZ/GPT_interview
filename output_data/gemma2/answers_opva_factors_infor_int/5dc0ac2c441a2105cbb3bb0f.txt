Here's a personality rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates a tendency towards orderliness and responsibility in some situations (putting things back in place, attention to detail in coding). However, there are instances where they admit to procrastination or not always following through (the coding challenge, the charity stream raffle). This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)** 

* **Evidence:** The person describes themselves as shy and uncomfortable in new social situations. They prefer to listen rather than lead in group discussions.  While they acknowledge they can be outgoing at times, their overall preference seems to lean towards introversion.  They also mention withdrawing from after-work social events. This points to a medium level of extraversion. 




**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited set of self-reported answers. A more comprehensive assessment would involve various other methods like standardized questionnaires and observations in different social contexts.
