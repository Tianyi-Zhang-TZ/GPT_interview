Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Rationale:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates carefulness, organization, and a strong sense of duty in their responses. They prioritize thoroughness, accuracy, and attention to detail in their work.  While they acknowledge making mistakes occasionally, they express a clear desire to minimize them and take responsibility. Examples include their approach to cleaning equipment, resolving technical issues, and seeking opportunities for professional development.  Their strategic and measured approach to achieving work-from-home arrangements further highlights their conscientious nature.

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual shows some comfort in social situations, particularly in professional settings where they can actively participate, there's a clear preference for smaller social circles and a tendency to avoid large or unstructured social gatherings. They seem content with work being separate from social life and prioritize their personal relationships outside of work. Their responses suggest a preference for deep connections over large-scale interactions.
