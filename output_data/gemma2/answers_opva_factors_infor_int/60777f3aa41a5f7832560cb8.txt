Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1 

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits associated with conscientiousness. They value order, efficiency, and attention to detail. Examples include their preference for putting things back in place, their diligence in following instructions, and their commitment to completing a challenging task despite difficulty. However, there aren't strong indications of them being *highly* conscientious, as they sometimes display impulsivity (volunteering for a tournament without thinking) and a desire for social engagement (enjoying the after-work party).

* **Extraversion:**  The person appears to be moderately extroverted. They express a willingness to engage in social settings, even if they initially feel uncomfortable. They enjoy leading discussions when they feel confident and are open to socializing outside of work. However, they don't seem to actively seek out social interaction or dominate conversations, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion.
