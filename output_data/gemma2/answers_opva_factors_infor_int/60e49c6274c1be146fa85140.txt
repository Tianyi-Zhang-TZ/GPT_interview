Conscientiousness: 2
Extraversion: 1 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong conscientiousness in specific situations (e.g., meticulous attention to detail in the annual report, taking on organizational tasks),  their answers also reveal a tendency towards reflecting and considering consequences before acting impulsively. This suggests a level of conscientiousness that is more on the medium side. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual shows some traits of extraversion (enjoying networking, initiating conversation, uplifting team spirits), but they also express nervousness in social situations where they don't know people and prefer listening over leading.  This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.
