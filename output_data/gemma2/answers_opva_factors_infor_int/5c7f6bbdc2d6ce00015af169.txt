Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

While there are instances where the person displays behaviors associated with both high conscientiousness (e.g., focusing on details, researching solutions, completing tasks) and high extraversion (e.g., initiating conversations, leading discussions, showing interest in social events), the responses overall suggest a **medium level** on both factors. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The person demonstrates a willingness to ask for help when needed and acknowledges the importance of accuracy and attention to detail. However, there's also a tendency to rely on others for information ("I didn't know anything... I just asked my boss") and a willingness to accept help even when capable of handling the task independently ("...asking wondering to get it comes down, but I feel like if the health is there you be kind of pointless to not take cuz I don't want to mess things up"). This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.
* **Extraversion:** The person actively tries to engage in social situations even when uncomfortable, demonstrates leadership qualities in group discussions, and attends work social events despite initial reluctance. However, they also express feelings of discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and mention feeling tired after work, indicating a preference for smaller, more intimate social interactions. This points towards a medium level of extraversion. 


The person's personality appears balanced, leaning slightly towards conscientiousness and extraversion, but not exhibiting extreme tendencies in either direction.
