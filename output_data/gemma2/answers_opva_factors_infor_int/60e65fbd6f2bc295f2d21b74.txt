## Personality Rating:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)** 
**Extraversion: 0 (Low)**

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They show awareness of responsibility (putting tools back, finishing tasks) and a tendency to be detail-oriented, aiming to avoid mistakes. However, they also express impulsiveness at times ("feeling jumpy" about wanting something badly), suggesting a lack of complete control and planning.

* **Extraversion:** The individual generally appears introverted. They express discomfort in social situations where they don't know anyone and prefer to listen rather than lead in group discussions. They seem content spending time alone and avoid social events unless they are with close friends. Their willingness to "accept what the president told us" in the fraternity meeting further indicates a preference for conformity over taking initiative.
