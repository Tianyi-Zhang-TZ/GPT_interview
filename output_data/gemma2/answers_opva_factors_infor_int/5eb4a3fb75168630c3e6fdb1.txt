Conscientiousness: 2 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a strong emphasis on organization, detail-orientation, and following through on tasks, there are hints of  being overly focused on control and structure.  Statements like "I don't usually make me jerk type of moves" and "Poor planning leads to poor results" suggest a preference for careful deliberation over impulsiveness, which aligns with a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:**  The individual clearly expresses discomfort with unstructured social situations and a preference for work-focused interactions. While they acknowledge their ability to facilitate conversations and lead discussions, their language suggests a preference for controlled environments and a reluctance to engage in purely social activities. This points to a medium level of extraversion.
