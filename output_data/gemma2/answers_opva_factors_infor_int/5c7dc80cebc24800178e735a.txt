Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1 

Here's why:

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a mix of conscientious and less conscientious behaviors. While they express a desire for organization and finishing tasks properly (Question 2, 4, 6), they also admit to struggling with impulsivity and feeling overwhelmed by detailed tasks (Question 6). This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.
* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling more comfortable expressing themselves in familiar social settings (Question 1) and enjoys having choices in social situations (Question 5). However, they also mention feeling a bit anxious in new social situations (Question 1) and not feeling obligated to comfort others (Question 7). This indicates a moderate level of extraversion.
