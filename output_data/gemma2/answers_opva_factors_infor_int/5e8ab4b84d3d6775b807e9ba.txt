Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 0 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a balanced approach to tasks and responsibility. While they acknowledge struggles and seek help when needed (like during the internship), they also show a willingness to persevere and learn.  They express a desire to be organized and avoid mistakes. This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes situations where they feel uncomfortable in social settings with unfamiliar people. They prefer solitude and avoid after-work events. They also indicate a preference for controlling discussions rather than taking a leading role. This pattern points towards a lower level of extraversion.
