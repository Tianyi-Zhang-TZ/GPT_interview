Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Explanation:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They express a willingness to put in effort, especially when learning new things, and acknowledge the importance of attention to detail (chess example). However, they also admit to sometimes finding tedious tasks like cleaning up after lab work to be a bit boring. This suggests a balance between diligence and occasional aversion to purely routine tasks, placing them in the medium range. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual seems to lean towards a medium level of extraversion. While they are not averse to social situations and can be comfortable in them, they often prefer a listening role in group discussions and are selective about attending social events. Their preference for close friends over broader social settings at school indicates a moderate need for social interaction.
