Here's an analysis of the personality scores based on the provided responses:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates a desire to be thorough and detail-oriented in their work ("meticulous eye," "take a very Alpha and type 1 anal personality type"). They acknowledge a tendency to be impulsive but express a desire to control this through self-discipline and rational thinking. However, there's no strong indication of consistently planning ahead or organizing their environment.

* **Note:**  Responses like seeking help when unsure ("I tend to flounder...asking for help") and admitting to taking on more responsibility than anticipated ("reach out to someone...relieve some of the responsibilities") suggest a level of conscientiousness, but not a consistently high one. 

**Extraversion: 2 (High)**

* **Evidence:** The individual clearly enjoys social interaction, thrives in group settings, and describes themselves as a "huge people person" who loves meeting new people. They actively participate in discussions, often taking a leadership role. They are also enthusiastic about after-work social events and express a preference for these situations over solitary activities. 

* **Note:** While their early college experience presented discomfort, the individual's overall self-description and behavior patterns strongly point towards high extraversion.
