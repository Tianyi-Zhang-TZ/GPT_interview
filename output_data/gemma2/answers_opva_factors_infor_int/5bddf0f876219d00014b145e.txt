Conscientiousness: 1
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness. They describe themselves as hardworking, organized, detail-oriented, and driven to achieve goals.  They value efficiency and completing tasks thoroughly. However, they also acknowledge moments where they struggle with impulsivity and sometimes prioritize  immediate gratification over long-term goals.

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a moderate level of extraversion. While they enjoy social interactions and forming connections (evident in their experiences at summer camp and with their running team), they also seem to value solitude and structure. They are comfortable taking on leadership roles but also recognize the importance of listening to others. Their preference for planning and organization suggests a need for some internal reflection and time alone.
