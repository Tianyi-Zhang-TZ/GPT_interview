Here's a personality assessment based on the provided responses, using the HEXACO model:

**Conscientiousness: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:** The individual demonstrates a mixed pattern. While they initially struggle with organization and attention to detail (e.g., working at Jimmy John's), they clearly develop competence and confidence over time. They also show a willingness to push themselves through challenges (cross country club) but sometimes struggle with impulsivity (schedule changes at work). This suggests a level of conscientiousness that is developing but not yet fully established.

**Extraversion: 1 (Medium)**

* **Evidence:**  The individual describes themselves as outgoing and talkative, but also acknowledges feeling shy and quiet in unfamiliar social situations. They enjoy social events but also value solitude and focus.  They describe themselves as a good listener and comfortable taking a leadership role, but also express nervousness when entering new social dynamics. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion with a preference for controlled social engagement.
