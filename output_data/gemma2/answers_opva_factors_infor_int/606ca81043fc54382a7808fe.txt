**Justification:**

While the individual demonstrates some conscientiousness in their desire for order and accuracy, and their tendency to plan and follow through, they also express moments of hesitancy and reliance on others for guidance (e.g., needing help with tools). This suggests a medium level of conscientiousness.

The individual consistently describes themselves as "shy" and "reserved" in social situations, preferring to observe and listen before participating. They also highlight their enjoyment of one-on-one interactions and careful selection of social situations. This pattern indicates a low level of extraversion.
