Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 1

**Justification:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a consistent pattern of organization, attention to detail, and a desire to follow through on tasks. They prioritize completing work thoroughly and accurately, as seen in their examples about equipment organization, the NASA contract, and seeking information before acting on workplace desires. While they display some impulsivity in social situations, their work-related examples strongly suggest a medium level of conscientiousness. 

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as outgoing and comfortable initiating social interactions, but they also express a preference for listening and observing in group discussions. They are selective about social events outside of work, indicating a moderate level of comfort with social engagement. Their examples suggest a preference for initiating interactions in controlled settings but not necessarily seeking constant social stimulation, pointing towards a medium level of extraversion.
