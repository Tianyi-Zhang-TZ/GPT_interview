* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a consistent pattern of being organized, detail-oriented, and dedicated to completing tasks thoroughly.

Examples like organizing equipment, meticulously following procedures during ziplining, and seeking responsibility at work point towards a medium level of conscientiousness.

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as introverted and uncomfortable in social situations. They prefer listening over leading, decline invitations to social events, and find it difficult to initiate interactions with strangers. Their account of seeking a promotion despite discomfort with self-promotion further supports a lower level of extraversion.
