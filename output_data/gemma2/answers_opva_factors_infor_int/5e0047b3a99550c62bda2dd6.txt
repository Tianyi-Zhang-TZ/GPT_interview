Conscientiousness: 1 
Extraversion: 0

**Reasoning:**

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays mixed responses regarding organization and task completion. While they express a desire to be considerate and put things back in place, their answers also reveal occasional messiness and impulsivity. This suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness, neither consistently highly organized nor consistently careless. 

* **Extraversion:**  The individual's answers consistently point towards a preference for solitude and a lack of enthusiasm for social gatherings. They describe themselves as "solitary," "not built" for raising spirits, and preferring to keep to themselves.  These responses strongly suggest a low level of extraversion.
