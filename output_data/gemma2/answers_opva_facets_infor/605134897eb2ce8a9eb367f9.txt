* **Social Boldness: 3.0**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to participate in social situations, even if they initially feel uncomfortable. They show a desire to connect with others and contribute to discussions, but they also seem aware of their boundaries and the importance of allowing space for others. 
* **Diligence: 4.0**  The individual clearly prioritizes responsibility and completing tasks thoroughly. They are self-aware enough to recognize their limits and the importance of self-care to avoid burnout. Their commitment to their work and clients is evident.
* **Prudence: 3.5**  The individual seems thoughtful and cautious, particularly when it comes to their well-being and professional boundaries. They demonstrate an awareness of potential consequences and a willingness to prioritize self-care. However, there are hints of stubbornness and a strong sense of personal limits.
* **Organization: 3.0**  The individual values order and cleanliness, as demonstrated by their preference for putting things back in place. However, the remote work situation might have lessened the need for strict organization in their daily life.
