* **Prudence: 2.0** The individual acknowledges the potential downsides of acting impulsively and expresses feelings of guilt after pursuing something they desired strongly. This indicates a moderate level of prudence.
* **Organization: 3.5**  The individual clearly values organization in a work environment, taking care to clean and put things away after use. This suggests a strong inclination towards organization.
* **Liveliness: 2.5**  While they express empathy and a desire to support their team members, their descriptions lack exuberance or a strong sense of energetic engagement.
