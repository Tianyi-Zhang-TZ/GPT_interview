Here's a breakdown of the personality facets based on the provided answers, along with reasoning for each rating:

**Social Boldness: 3/5** 

* **Evidence:** The individual doesn't shy away from helping colleagues and offering advice, indicating some comfort in social situations. However, they also mention preferring close friends outside of work and declining social events with coworkers. This suggests a preference for smaller, more intimate social settings.

**Diligence: 4/5**

* **Evidence:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic. They describe pushing through challenging situations at work, taking pride in their performance, and being detail-oriented. Their willingness to help struggling colleagues also reflects diligence.

**Prudence: 4/5**

* **Evidence:** The individual consistently demonstrates thoughtful decision-making. They carefully consider their actions, prioritize fairness and honesty, and avoid impulsive behavior. Their ability to recognize and manage their own emotions (like resisting the urge to steal tables from coworkers) is indicative of prudence.

**Organization: 3/5**

* **Evidence:** The answers don't provide much direct insight into the individual's organizational skills. While they mention working in a busy environment and handling multiple tasks, there's no explicit mention of organizational strategies or habits.

**Liveliness: 2/5**

* **Evidence:** The individual describes themselves as generally helpful and positive, but they also express a preference for quiet evenings at home after work and declining social events. This suggests a more reserved and introverted personality.

**Perfectionism: 3/5**

* **Evidence:** The individual mentions striving for their best in all situations and being detail-oriented, which aligns with perfectionistic tendencies. However, they also express a willingness to ask for help and acknowledge the limitations of being perfect.

**Social Self-Esteem: 3/5**

* **Evidence:** The individual appears comfortable offering advice and help to others, indicating a degree of confidence in their abilities. However, their preference for smaller social circles and declining social events suggests a possible hesitation in seeking validation from larger groups.

**Sociability: 2/5**

* **Evidence:** While the individual enjoys helping colleagues and engaging in work-related social interactions, they clearly prefer close friends outside of work and decline most after-work social events. This indicates a preference for more intimate social connections.
