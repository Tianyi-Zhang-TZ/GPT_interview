**Social boldness: 4/7**  While the candidate demonstrates the ability to take charge in group discussions and make decisions, there's also a sense of hesitation in social situations. The example of skipping the after-work event highlights a preference for focusing on personal goals over immediate social engagement.

**Diligence: 6/7** The candidate consistently emphasizes a strong work ethic and commitment to learning.  The coding example showcases a willingness to push themselves despite challenges, and the fundraising example highlights attention to detail and dedication to achieving goals.

**Prudence: 6/7** The candidate demonstrates sound judgment, especially in the fundraising example where they prioritize accuracy over an easy win.
