Here's a personality rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social Boldness: 2.0**  The individual expresses discomfort in unfamiliar social situations and describes themselves as "very shy." While they mention making friends over time, their initial response suggests a reluctance to take social initiative. 
* **Diligence: 4.0** The answer about the research project highlights persistence and dedication. The individual describes pushing through challenges and working hard to find solutions.
* **Prudence: 3.0** The answer about the wedding company is incomplete, making it difficult to assess Prudence fully. However, the individual's focus on avoiding mistakes in tasks suggests a degree of cautiousness.
* **Organization: 3.5** The description of their work habits indicates a strong sense of order and attention to placement.  They seem to naturally keep things organized and in their place.
* **Liveliness: 2.5** While the individual describes a situation where they tried to uplift a teammate, their overall responses suggest a more reserved and introspective personality. They don't seem to actively seek out excitement or express themselves with exuberance.
* **Perfectionism: 3.0**  The answer about paying attention to detail in video games and avoiding mistakes in general points towards a desire for accuracy and a tendency to strive for high standards.
* **Social Self-esteem: 2.0** The individual explicitly states feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and describes themselves as "shy." This suggests a lower level of confidence in social situations.
* **Sociability: 2.5**  The answer about after-work events indicates a preference for connecting with colleagues but not necessarily a strong drive to be in social situations frequently.

**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be treated as a preliminary assessment. A comprehensive personality evaluation would involve more in-depth questioning, observation, and potentially standardized personality tests.
