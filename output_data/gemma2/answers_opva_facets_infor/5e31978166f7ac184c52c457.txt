**Organization: 3.0**  The example provided shows attention to detail and putting things back in order. However, more examples would be needed to solidify a higher rating.

**Liveliness: 2.5**  The individual demonstrates empathy and a willingness to support team members, but their descriptions don't strongly convey a lively or enthusiastic personality.

**Sociability: 3.5**  The individual seems to enjoy social events and seeks them out as a way to unwind and prepare for the next day.
