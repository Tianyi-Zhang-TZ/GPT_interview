Here's a personality score rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social Boldness: 3.0**  The individual demonstrates some initial shyness in new social situations but actively seeks to engage and become comfortable. Their experience leading group discussions suggests a capacity for social leadership when familiar with the environment. 
* **Diligence: 4.5**  The individual's commitment to completing the demanding writing project, even with increased workload, highlights their strong work ethic and dedication. Their attention to detail and history of dependable performance further support this.
* **Prudence: 3.5**  The individual's decision to pursue the screenwriting course to enhance their qualifications for the Disney position demonstrates careful planning and a desire to make a well-informed choice.
* **Organization: 4.0**  Their strong emphasis on tidiness and order in their work environment, as well as their clear approach to leading group discussions, points to a well-organized personality.
* **Liveliness: 2.5** While the individual enjoys boosting team morale through food and friendly competitions, they don't seem to be naturally outgoing or highly energetic.
* **Perfectionism: 3.0**  Their attention to detail and commitment to following instructions suggest a degree of perfectionism. However, their self-description as "detail-oriented" rather than "perfectionistic" indicates a balanced approach.
* **Social Self-esteem: 2.0**  The individual's initial shyness in new social settings and preference for familiar environments suggest a need for greater social confidence. 
* **Sociability: 2.5**  While they are willing to join social events with colleagues they know well, they generally prefer to avoid large or unfamiliar social gatherings. 



**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited sample of self-reported information. A comprehensive personality assessment would involve multiple methods and a larger data set.
