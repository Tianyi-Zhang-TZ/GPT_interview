* **Organization:** 4.0
* **Liveliness:** 2.5

**Justification:**

* **Social Boldness (3.0):** The individual describes themselves as more comfortable in smaller groups and leading rather than following. While they enjoy leading, they also express some hesitation in large social situations. This suggests a moderate level of social boldness.
* **Diligence (4.5):** The answers consistently highlight a strong work ethic and attention to detail, especially from their nursing experience. They demonstrate a commitment to completing tasks thoroughly and accurately.
* **Prudence (4.0):** The individual values honesty and ethical behavior, as exemplified by their father's example. They seem to carefully consider consequences before acting impulsively. 
* **Organization (4.0):**  The answer about returning equipment to its proper place showcases a clear preference for order and organization.
* **Liveliness (2.5):** While they express positivity and support for their team, their descriptions lean towards reserved and thoughtful rather than energetic or outgoing.
* **Perfectionism (3.5):**  The emphasis on accuracy and avoiding mistakes in their nursing role suggests a tendency towards perfectionism. However, it's not extreme, as they acknowledge the possibility of needing help when facing particularly challenging tasks.
* **Social Self-Esteem (2.0):** The individual expresses anxiety and discomfort in unfamiliar social settings. They appear more confident in smaller, more familiar groups. This points to a lower level of social self-esteem.
* **Sociability (2.5):** While they enjoy spending time with family and colleagues, they generally prefer to decline after-work social events. This suggests a moderate level of sociability.
