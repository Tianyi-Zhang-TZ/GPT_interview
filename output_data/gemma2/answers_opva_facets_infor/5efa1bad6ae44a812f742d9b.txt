Here's a personality score rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social Boldness: 3.5**  The individual describes themselves as talkative and a natural leader, comfortable assuming charge in group discussions. However, their initial anxiety in new social situations suggests a slight hesitation before fully embracing boldness. 
* **Diligence: 3.0**  The individual demonstrates a strong work ethic, driven to complete tasks efficiently and with attention to detail. They acknowledge feeling anxious and rushed at times, indicating a potential for diligence to be overshadowed by pressure.
* **Prudence: 2.5** The individual describes themselves as impulsive and driven, sometimes acting on anxiety rather than careful consideration.  This suggests a need for more balanced decision-making.
* **Organization: 3.5**  The individual clearly values organization and efficiency, striving to put things back in place and maintain order. Their description of themselves as "nitpicky" further reinforces this facet.
* **Liveliness: 4.0**  The individual consistently expresses a positive and energetic demeanor, even in challenging situations. They actively seek out social interaction and aim to uplift others with their enthusiasm.
* **Perfectionism: 3.0**  The individual displays a strong focus on detail and a desire to avoid mistakes. While this can be beneficial, their tendency to "mute out everything else" when focused on a task suggests a potential for perfectionism to become excessive.
* **Social Self-Esteem: 2.5**  While the individual enjoys social situations, they admit to feeling anxious and reserved in unfamiliar settings. This suggests a degree of self-consciousness and a need for greater confidence in social interactions.
* **Sociability: 4.0**  The individual actively seeks out social interaction, enjoys being around people, and describes themselves as "extroverted." Their desire to participate in after-work events and their empathetic nature further support this facet.



**Important Note:** These ratings are based solely on the provided answers and should not be considered a definitive assessment of the individual's personality. A comprehensive evaluation would require more in-depth testing and observation.
