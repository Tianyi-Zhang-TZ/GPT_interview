Here's a personality rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model and its 8 facets:

* **Social Boldness: 3.0**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to ask questions and contribute in group settings, suggesting comfort in social situations. However, the initial discomfort in the unfamiliar social setting hints at a possible lower score if not for their eventual engagement. 

* **Diligence: 4.0** The individual consistently shows a strong work ethic and commitment to completing tasks, even challenging ones. They describe themselves as someone who "bucks against" difficulties and strives for excellence.

* **Prudence: 2.5** While the individual claims to not act impulsively, they struggle to provide a concrete example of wanting something badly and acting on impulse. This suggests a moderate level of prudence.

* **Organization: 2.0** The anecdote about struggling to put equipment back in its place after an experiment suggests a potential weakness in organization. 

* **Liveliness: 3.5** The individual describes themselves as someone who can raise the spirits of their team members and appears to enjoy motivating others. This points towards a higher level of liveliness.

* **Perfectionism: 1.5** The individual acknowledges making mistakes, particularly in mathematics, and admits to a tendency to think globally rather than meticulously detail-oriented. This suggests a lower score on perfectionism.

* **Social Self-Esteem: 2.5** While the individual initially felt uncomfortable in the unfamiliar social setting, they ultimately pushed through and found it to be a positive experience. This suggests a moderate level of social self-esteem.

* **Sociability: 1.5** The individual prioritizes family and church commitments over after-work social events, indicating a preference for smaller, more intimate social circles. This suggests a lower score on sociability. 



**Important Note:** These ratings are based solely on the provided text and should be considered preliminary. A comprehensive personality assessment would involve a wider range of questions and standardized testing methods.
