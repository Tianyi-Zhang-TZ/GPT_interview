Here's a personality score based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model and its 8 facets:

* **Social boldness: 2.5**  The individual describes discomfort in social situations where they don't know people, indicating a tendency towards lower social boldness. However, they also mention not being shy and enjoying meeting new people, suggesting some degree of social comfort. 

* **Diligence: 4.0** The individual demonstrates strong diligence in their work examples. They handle challenging situations with persistence, focus on accuracy, and take pride in completing tasks successfully.

* **Prudence: 3.5** While the individual expresses a strong desire for a specific job, they also acknowledge the limitations of their situation and accept that their goal might not be attainable. This suggests a balance between ambition and realistic assessment.

* **Organization: 3.0** The example about the Jet Bridge connector shows a level of organizational awareness and concern for safety protocols. However, the lack of further examples makes it difficult to assess this facet fully.

* **Liveliness: 2.0** The individual doesn't provide many examples of enthusiasm or expressiveness. Their descriptions tend to be more factual and focused on tasks.

* **Perfectionism: 3.5** The data entry job example highlights a focus on accuracy and the importance of getting things right.  

* **Social self-esteem: 2.5** The individual expresses some discomfort in unfamiliar social settings, suggesting a moderate level of social self-esteem. They seem to value personal space and boundaries.

* **Sociability: 1.5** The individual clearly prefers to keep work and personal life separate and avoids after-work social events with colleagues. This indicates a low preference for social interaction outside of necessary professional contexts. 



**Important Note:** This personality assessment is based on a limited set of responses and should not be considered a definitive or comprehensive evaluation. A more thorough assessment would involve a wider range of questions and potentially standardized testing.
