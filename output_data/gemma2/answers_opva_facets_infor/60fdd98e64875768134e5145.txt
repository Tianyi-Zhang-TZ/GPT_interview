Here are the ratings based on the provided answers, along with explanations:

* **Social Boldness: 4/10**  The responses indicate a tendency to observe and gauge situations before acting, even in challenging tasks. While there's a willingness to take the lead, it often comes after careful consideration. The hesitation to act impulsively suggests a lower level of social boldness.

* **Diligence: 8/10** The answers consistently highlight a strong work ethic and commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. The emphasis on "under-promise over-deliver" and the "100% brain power" during detail-oriented tasks clearly demonstrate a high level of diligence.

* **Prudence: 7/10**  The individual demonstrates a thoughtful approach, considering potential consequences before acting. The 10-second courage concept and the careful analysis of situations before making decisions point towards a thoughtful and cautious nature, aligning with prudence.

* **Organization: 6/10** The response suggests an awareness of the importance of observation and understanding the dynamics of a situation before contributing. While there's a preference for observing first and leading later, it doesn't explicitly showcase strong organizational skills or a structured approach.

* **Liveliness: 5/10**  The answers don't convey a sense of exuberance or high energy. While there's a willingness to be supportive and uplift team members, the overall tone leans towards thoughtful and measured rather than lively and outgoing.

* **Perfectionism: 4/10** The individual strives for quality and completion, but the emphasis on "under-promise over-deliver" suggests a focus on exceeding expectations rather than striving for flawlessness. The acknowledgment that "people are not always thing that amazing" indicates a realistic perspective rather than an obsessive pursuit of perfection.

* **Social Self-Esteem: 6/10**  The responses indicate a willingness to engage in social situations and express concerns, but there's also a self-awareness of potential discomfort in certain social settings. The individual values being included but also considers the appropriateness of the situation.

* **Sociability: 5/10** While the individual enjoys being included in social events and is supportive of team members, there's a preference for working with people of similar age and interests. The careful consideration of social dynamics suggests a desire for comfortable and meaningful interactions rather than simply being in social settings.
