* **Social boldness: 3.0**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to express opinions and beliefs in social settings, especially when comfortable. They also take a leading role in discussions when passionate about the topic. However, they initially feel uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations, suggesting a moderate level of social boldness. 
* **Diligence: 4.0**  The individual expresses a strong drive to complete challenging tasks and a preference for self-reliance. They find satisfaction in overcoming difficulties and are meticulous in their work, rechecking it multiple times for perfection.
* **Prudence: 3.5** The individual demonstrates careful consideration before acting, particularly in work-related situations. They weigh their qualifications and the potential impact of their actions, suggesting a tendency towards thoughtful decision-making.
* **Organization: 3.0** The individual values order and respects the work environment, demonstrating a preference for putting things back in place. While this suggests organizational tendencies, there's no strong indication of highly structured or meticulous organization habits.
* **Liveliness: 2.5** The individual appears to be more reserved and less outwardly expressive. While they can be enthusiastic and supportive of their team members, their primary focus seems to be on thoughtful action and providing practical support rather than being the center of attention.
* **Perfectionism: 4.0**  The individual clearly exhibits perfectionistic tendencies, striving for accuracy and meticulously rechecking their work. They express a strong desire for things to be "perfect" and this appears to be a significant driving force in their approach to tasks.
* **Social self-esteem: 2.0**  The individual initially feels uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings, indicating a lower level of social self-esteem. While they can become more confident and expressive over time, their initial hesitation suggests a need for greater social comfort.
* **Sociability: 3.5**  The individual enjoys socializing with colleagues outside of work and values getting to know them on a personal level. They believe this fosters a better work environment and can lead to stronger relationships.
