Here are the ratings based on the provided answers, along with explanations:

* **Social Boldness: 4/7**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to step outside their comfort zone in social situations (attending after-work events, joking with coworkers), but also acknowledges shyness and a preference for smaller, more controlled interactions. 

* **Diligence: 6/7**  The individual shows a strong commitment to learning and improving, even when facing challenging tasks. They are self-reliant and seek help only when necessary. The detailed approach to tasks requiring attention to detail further supports this.

* **Prudence: 5/7**  The individual weighs risks and rewards carefully. They demonstrate a calculated approach to career advancement (applying for a promotion despite some hesitation) and avoid impulsive actions. 

* **Organization: Not clearly defined**  The answers don't provide enough information to accurately assess organizational skills.

* **Liveliness: 3/7**  While the individual enjoys humor and can be lighthearted, they don't consistently display outward enthusiasm or a tendency to be the center of attention. They prefer to observe and participate rather than dominate social situations.

* **Perfectionism: 6/7**  The individual strives for accuracy and detail in their work. They exhibit a tendency to reread and review tasks multiple times to ensure quality.

* **Social Self-Esteem: 4/7**  The individual appears comfortable interacting with others but also expresses some self-doubt (e.g., not confident in their sense of humor). 

* **Sociability: 4/7**  The individual values positive relationships with coworkers and enjoys social events when they feel comfortable. However, they are not necessarily outgoing or constantly seeking social interaction.
