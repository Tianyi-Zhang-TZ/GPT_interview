* **Sociability: 3.5** The individual values good relationships with colleagues and sees after-work events as opportunities to strengthen these bonds. They also highlight the importance of collaboration and teamwork.


**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited sample of responses and should not be considered a definitive personality assessment. A comprehensive evaluation would require a more in-depth analysis using standardized psychological instruments.
