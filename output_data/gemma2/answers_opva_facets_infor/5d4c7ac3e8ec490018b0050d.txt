Here's a personality score rating based on the provided responses, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social boldness: 3.0**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to participate in discussions and take on leadership roles, suggesting comfort in social situations. However, their initial anxiety in the open mic poetry group and hesitation to act impulsively for a desired job role hint at some social inhibition. 

* **Diligence: 2.5** The individual expresses a willingness to learn new technologies and persevere through challenges.  Their experience with the graphic design program shows effort, but their initial fear and tendency to avoid new things suggest a moderate level of diligence.

* **Prudence: 3.5** The individual carefully considers their actions and avoids impulsive decisions. Their thoughtful approach to switching dates and their desire to help customers rather than seeking immediate personal gain demonstrate a preference for careful planning and consideration.

* **Organization: 2.0** While the individual mentions learning to change printer ink, there's no strong indication of a highly organized approach to tasks or daily life.

* **Liveliness: 3.0** The individual shows empathy and a desire to uplift others, as seen in their role as an open mic co-host. They appear to be engaged and enthusiastic about social interactions, but not necessarily overly energetic or playful.

* **Perfectionism: 3.5** The individual expresses a strong focus on detail and accuracy, particularly when learning new programs. Their concern about making mistakes and the desire to avoid spelling errors suggest a tendency towards perfectionism.

* **Social self-esteem: 2.5** The individual acknowledges social anxiety but demonstrates a capacity to "put on a good face" and manage it effectively. Their willingness to participate in social settings despite initial discomfort suggests a moderate level of social self-esteem.

* **Sociability: 3.0** The individual enjoys social events and participating in discussions.  They are willing to engage with coworkers outside of work and show a desire to connect with people. However, their initial hesitation to attend the Christmas party suggests a preference for more intimate social settings.
