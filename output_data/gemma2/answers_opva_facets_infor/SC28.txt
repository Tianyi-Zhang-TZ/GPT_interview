Here's a personality score rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social boldness: 3.5**  The individual seems comfortable initiating in social situations and enjoys leading discussions when they feel knowledgeable.  
* **Diligence: 3.0**  While they express frustration with challenging tasks and a desire to push through them, there's also a hint of avoidance ("I just have no solution"). This suggests a willingness to work hard but not always a strong drive to persevere through difficulties.
* **Prudence: 2.5**  Their statement about "going for it" when they want something suggests a tendency towards impulsivity. However, they also acknowledge the need to think things through a bit. This indicates a moderate level of prudence.
* **Organization: 2.0**  The description of their workspace as often cluttered and only cleaned when it becomes "too frustrating" points to a lower score on organization.
* **Liveliness: 3.5**  They come across as energetic and optimistic, actively trying to cheer up others and focusing on the positive aspects of situations.
* **Perfectionism: 3.0**  Their desire to minimize distractions and focus intently on tasks suggests a degree of perfectionism. However, they don't explicitly mention striving for flawlessness in all aspects of their work.
* **Social self-esteem: 4.0**  They confidently describe feeling comfortable in new social situations and even enjoying them. This indicates a high level of social self-esteem.
* **Sociability: 3.0**  While they enjoy socializing and value connecting with people, they also prioritize completing work and sometimes choose to skip social events if they have pressing deadlines. This suggests a moderate level of sociability.




**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited sample of responses and should be treated as a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a wider range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
