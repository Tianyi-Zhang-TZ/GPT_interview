Here's a personality score rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social Boldness: 2.5**  The individual describes themselves as reserved and preferring to listen in group discussions. While they acknowledge the importance of sharing their opinion, they don't seem to actively seek out leadership roles or dominate conversations. 
* **Diligence: 4.0**  The individual demonstrates strong commitment and persistence. They went to great lengths to complete a challenging task, even sacrificing sleep. Their current job requires meticulous attention to detail, further highlighting their dedication.
* **Prudence: 3.5** The individual emphasizes reliability and trustworthiness. They describe themselves as someone who follows rules and avoids impulsive actions.  While they might not always be the most outgoing, their focus on responsibility suggests a cautious and thoughtful approach.
* **Organization: 3.0** The individual clearly values organization, as demonstrated by their ability to clean up their workspace after work. However, there's no mention of consistently maintaining order in other areas of their life, suggesting it's more of a preference than a defining characteristic.
* **Liveliness: 2.0** The individual doesn't come across as particularly energetic or enthusiastic. They are more reserved and prefer to listen rather than be the center of attention. Their efforts to cheer up friends suggest a capacity for empathy and kindness, but not necessarily exuberance.
* **Perfectionism: 3.5**  The individual describes themselves as detail-oriented and "nitpicky," indicating a strong desire for accuracy and precision. They seem to set high standards for themselves and strive for excellence in their work.
* **Social Self-esteem: 2.0** The individual expresses nervousness and anxiety in social situations, particularly unfamiliar ones. They describe themselves as "not very talkative" and seem uncomfortable with the pressure of a job interview. This suggests a lower level of confidence in social settings.
* **Sociability: 2.5** While the individual acknowledges enjoying socializing with some coworkers, they don't seem to actively seek out social events or engage with everyone. They prefer a more selective approach to social interaction. 



**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be treated as a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a wider range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
