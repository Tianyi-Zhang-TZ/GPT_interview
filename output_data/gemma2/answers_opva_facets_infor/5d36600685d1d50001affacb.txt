Here are the facet ratings based on the provided answers, along with explanations:

* **Social Boldness: 6/10**  While the interviewee expresses a willingness to take on leadership roles and initiate social interactions, there are instances where they hesitate or express nervousness.  The example of the after-work event shows a desire for social connection but also a touch of anxiety. 
* **Diligence: 8/10** The interviewee demonstrates a strong work ethic and commitment to quality. The story about the copper bars highlights their self-sufficiency and determination to overcome challenges, even when seeking help. 
* **Prudence: 5/10** The interviewee's decision to pursue the promotion without fully considering the implications (like the impact on their family) suggests a tendency to act impulsively. However, their consideration of their wife's input shows some level of thoughtful deliberation.
* **Organization:  N/A**  There isn't enough information in the responses to accurately assess this facet.
* **Liveliness: 7/10** The interviewee comes across as energetic and enthusiastic, particularly when describing their role as a "spiritual leader" and their use of humor to uplift their team.
* **Perfectionism: 6/10**  The interviewee enjoys detailed work and takes pride in accuracy, but they also acknowledge their limitations and seek assistance when needed. This suggests a healthy balance rather than an extreme focus on flawlessness.
* **Social Self-Esteem: 7/10** The interviewee expresses confidence in their social abilities and enjoys interacting with others. They describe themselves as gregarious and extroverted.
* **Sociability: 8/10** The interviewee clearly values social connections and actively seeks opportunities to interact with colleagues. They believe in building positive relationships and creating a friendly work environment.
