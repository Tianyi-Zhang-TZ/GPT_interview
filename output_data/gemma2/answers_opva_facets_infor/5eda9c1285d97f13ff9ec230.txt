Here's a personality score based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social boldness: 2.5**  The individual describes themselves as introverted and prefers listening roles in discussions. While they initiated a meeting, they did so to facilitate others' participation rather than take center stage. 
* **Diligence: 4.0**  The individual consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic. They enjoy challenges, put in extra effort, and find satisfaction in solving technical problems. 
* **Prudence: 3.5** The individual often reflects before acting, especially when impulses arise. They demonstrate careful consideration and prioritize thoughtful decision-making over impulsive actions.
* **Organization: 2.0** The individual admits to having a "not very clean" desk and prioritizing functionality over meticulous organization. This suggests a lower tendency towards organizational traits.
* **Liveliness: 2.0** The individual describes themselves as reserved and introverted, preferring quiet activities and focused work over lively social engagements.
* **Perfectionism: 3.0** The individual displays attention to detail and a desire for accuracy in their work, but doesn't necessarily exhibit traits of extreme perfectionism or obsession with flawlessness.
* **Social self-esteem: 3.0**  The individual seems comfortable in social situations once they adapt. They describe themselves as capable of developing rapport and engaging in conversation, but initial discomfort suggests a moderate level of social self-esteem.
* **Sociability: 2.5** While the individual recognizes the importance of socializing, they primarily prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings. They are willing to participate but not necessarily outgoing or enthusiastic about large social events.
