* **Prudence:** 3.5
    *  The individual demonstrates patience, careful consideration, and a preference for thoughtful action over impulsive decisions. They also value maintaining a work-life balance.
* **Organization:** 4.0
    *  The responses clearly indicate a preference for order and structure. They describe themselves as good with technical things, putting things back in place, and enjoying organization as part of their personality.
* **Liveliness:** 2.5
    * While they express a desire to be supportive of team members, the descriptions lean more towards calmness and support rather than exuberance or a tendency to liven up situations.
