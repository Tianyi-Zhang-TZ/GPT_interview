Here's a personality score rating based on the provided answers, using the HEXACO model:

* **Social boldness: 2.0**  The individual describes themselves as preferring to listen in group discussions and avoiding leadership roles due to a perceived lack of receptiveness from others. This suggests a lower tendency for social boldness. 
* **Diligence: 3.0** While the individual admits to frustration with challenging tasks and sometimes taking breaks, they also express a desire to solve problems independently and a commitment to thoroughness, even if it leads to exhaustion. This indicates a moderate level of diligence.
* **Prudence: 4.0** The individual consistently emphasizes caution and careful consideration before acting. They avoid impulsive decisions and prioritize a stable work-life balance. This suggests a high level of prudence.
* **Organization: 2.0** The anecdote about struggling to return large coolers highlights a lack of organizational skills. The individual admits to feeling inadequate and frustrated in this situation.
* **Liveliness: 3.0** The individual uses humor to cope with difficult situations and attempts to lighten the mood, particularly for a colleague battling cancer. While not overtly energetic, they demonstrate a capacity for positive engagement and emotional support.
* **Perfectionism: 4.0** The individual describes their tendency to be detail-oriented, double-check work, and experience frustration when mistakes are made. This points to a high level of perfectionism.
* **Social self-esteem: 1.5** The story about feeling uncomfortable and targeted in a predominantly male bar suggests low social self-esteem. The individual feels self-conscious and vulnerable in unfamiliar social settings.
* **Sociability: 2.5** While the individual expresses a preference for avoiding after-work social events and describes themselves as "suspicious" and "off-putting" in those situations, they do acknowledge the importance of seeing colleagues at work. This suggests a moderate level of sociability, leaning towards introversion.



**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited sample of self-reported information. A comprehensive personality assessment would involve more diverse and standardized measures.
