Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes feeling nervous in social situations initially, they also express a strong ability to connect with people and enjoy social interactions once comfortable.  Their willingness to lead discussions and give presentations suggests a comfortable level of social engagement. The preference for close friends over after-work social events hints at a preference for more intimate social settings. 
* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on organization, diligence, and attention to detail.  Their descriptions of work habits and the importance placed on thoroughness point to a highly conscientious personality. Their commitment to completing tasks and avoiding mistakes, even in stressful situations, further supports this rating.
