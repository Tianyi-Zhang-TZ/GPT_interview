Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even if they initially feel uncomfortable. They describe adapting to a new environment and excelling in a challenging social setting. However, they also express a preference for listening over speaking initially and a general lack of enthusiasm for frequent social events. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion in some aspects.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently highlights their attention to detail, organizational skills, and dedication to completing tasks thoroughly. They mention their diligence in adhering to grant requirements, their commitment to self-improvement through physical exercise, and their efforts to support their team members during difficult times. These examples strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
