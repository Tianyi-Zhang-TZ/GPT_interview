Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as an ambivert, comfortable in social situations but not always seeking them out. Their experience moving to a new country and becoming more social suggests a capacity for extraversion, but they also acknowledge a preference for solitude at times. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. They prioritize completing tasks, value structure, and strive for accuracy. Their examples of travel planning, work habits, and leadership style all point towards a strong conscientiousness.
