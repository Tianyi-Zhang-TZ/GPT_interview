Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of extraversion. While they acknowledge feeling more reserved in unfamiliar social settings, they actively initiate conversations and engage with others. Their enjoyment of after-work social events and willingness to lead in group discussions further support this rating. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a solid level of conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, as evidenced by their meticulous cleaning habits at work. They also demonstrate diligence by pushing themselves through challenging kayaking experiences and paying close attention to detail in surveys. Their desire to complete tasks thoroughly and their leadership qualities during a team slump suggest a strong sense of responsibility.
