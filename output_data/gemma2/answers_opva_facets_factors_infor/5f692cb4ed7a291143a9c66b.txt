Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mix of social comfort and reservation. While they describe themselves as friendly and warm, they also acknowledge feeling a bit scared and reserved in large social settings. Their enjoyment of social interaction and openness to new people points towards higher extraversion, but the occasional discomfort suggests a score closer to the middle range.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness across various situations. They emphasize their hard work, diligence, organization, and attention to detail. Examples like putting equipment back in place, completing a challenging class, and ensuring compliance in their previous role highlight their commitment to responsibility and thoroughness.
