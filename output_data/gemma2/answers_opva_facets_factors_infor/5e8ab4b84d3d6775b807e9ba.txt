**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as "not an extroverted person" and prefers to avoid large social events. They admit to feeling uncomfortable in new social situations, even though they usually enjoy interacting with people. This suggests a preference for smaller social circles and a moderate level of comfort in social settings.

They also exhibit diligence,  persisting through challenges during their internship and seeking help when needed.
