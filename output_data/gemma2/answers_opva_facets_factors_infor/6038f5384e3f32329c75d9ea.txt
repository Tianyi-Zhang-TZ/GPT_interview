Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.2 

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and engagement. They describe themselves as outgoing, comfortable initiating conversations, and finding common ground with others.  Their experience at the leadership event exemplifies their ability to confidently navigate unfamiliar social situations.  However, they also demonstrate a degree of social selectivity, choosing to decline the Christmas party due to potential negative influences. This suggests a balanced approach to extraversion rather than an extreme preference for constant social stimulation.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and cleanliness, meticulously plan tasks, pay close attention to detail, and strive for accuracy. They demonstrate diligence, taking initiative, delegating effectively, and seeking solutions when faced with challenges. Their commitment to teamwork and willingness to go the extra mile for desired outcomes further reinforce their high conscientiousness.
