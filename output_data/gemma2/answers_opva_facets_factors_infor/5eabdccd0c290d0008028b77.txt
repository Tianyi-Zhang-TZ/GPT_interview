Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The responses suggest a preference for solitude and a lack of enthusiasm for social situations. Phrases like "open settings and no energy," "I'd rather be homeless in the bottom of everything in me," and "I haven't gone" indicate a lower drive for social interaction and a tendency to withdraw in social settings. However, the individual does describe taking a leading role in a discussion and expressing a desire for fun, hinting at some capacity for social engagement under certain circumstances.

* **Conscientiousness:** The answers demonstrate a mixed picture of conscientiousness. While the individual mentions feeling overwhelmed and struggling to organize their work ("everything backed away and I did just because I feel like I can't move a thing"), they also express a desire to complete tasks ("I'm finish LLC be down by half") and acknowledge the importance of self-restraint ("there's no it up right now. Is finishes work for checking in after that as some self-restraint").  The description of pushing themselves to do 100 push-ups also points towards diligence. Overall, the responses lean towards a moderate level of conscientiousness. 



It's important to note that these are preliminary ratings based on limited information. A more comprehensive assessment would require a broader range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
