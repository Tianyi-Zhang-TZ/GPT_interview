Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes being more outgoing now than in the past, their preference for solitude and their enjoyment of solo activities suggest a leaning towards introversion. Their comfort with social situations is more about competence than a genuine enjoyment of constant social interaction. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. Their emphasis on organization, attention to detail, diligence, and adherence to rules and routines are all strong indicators. Their desire for efficiency and accuracy in their work further supports this rating.
