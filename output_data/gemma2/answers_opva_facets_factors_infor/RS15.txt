Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a preference for social interaction and engagement. They describe themselves as extroverted, enjoy meeting new people, and feel energized by social settings. Their desire to lead in discussions and their excitement about after-work social events strongly suggest a high level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong organizational skills and a tendency towards diligence, there are instances where impulsivity and a preference for immediate gratification are evident. Their willingness to prioritize helping others over their own needs (e.g., waiting to eat lunch) and their patience with challenging situations suggest a conscientious nature. However, their tendency to act impulsively in certain situations (e.g., wanting to leave a meeting for lunch) indicates a slightly lower level of conscientiousness. 


Overall, the individual appears to be highly extraverted and moderately conscientious.
