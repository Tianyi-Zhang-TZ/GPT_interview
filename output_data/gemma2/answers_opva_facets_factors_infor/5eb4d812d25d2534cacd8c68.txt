Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual expresses some shyness in new social situations, they also demonstrate a willingness to engage in after-work social events and a desire to contribute to group discussions.  Their comfort level with social situations seems to increase with familiarity.  Their  athletic background and leadership experience also suggest a capacity for extroverted behavior.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization,  take pride in completing tasks meticulously (even challenging ones), and demonstrate diligence and a strong work ethic. Their focus on accuracy and attention to detail further reinforce this assessment.
