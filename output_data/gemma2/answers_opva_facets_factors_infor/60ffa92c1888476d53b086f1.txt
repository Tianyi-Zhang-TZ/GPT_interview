Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally open and warm, but also acknowledges feeling awkward and anxious in unfamiliar social situations. Their willingness to eventually engage with people at the party and their ability to lead in the group project suggest a moderate level of extraversion. They also seem to enjoy socializing but sometimes prefer to observe and let others take the lead.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits associated with high conscientiousness. They value organization and efficiency, as seen in their preference for putting things back in place and their efforts to find the right tools at work. They also show diligence in their studies, pushing themselves to succeed even when facing challenges. Their attention to detail in their barista job and their desire to perform well in their classes further support this assessment. Their tendency to plan ahead and avoid impulsive actions also aligns with conscientiousness.
