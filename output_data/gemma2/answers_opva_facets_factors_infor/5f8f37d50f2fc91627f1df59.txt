Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and enjoyment, particularly when it involves familiar faces and shared interests (e.g., the book club, after-work gatherings with colleagues). However, they also express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and acknowledge a tendency towards shyness in those situations. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and order (e.g., returning equipment to its proper place), demonstrate diligence and attention to detail in their work, and strive for accuracy and completeness in their tasks. They also express a willingness to put in extra effort when necessary and show a desire to avoid mistakes.
