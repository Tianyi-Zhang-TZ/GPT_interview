Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear shift from initial social anxiety to a more outgoing and proactive personality. Their willingness to initiate conversations, lead in group settings, and actively participate in social events suggests a higher level of extraversion.  While they still acknowledge past anxieties, their current behavior indicates a comfortable level of engagement with others. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. Their emphasis on organization, attention to detail, diligence in completing tasks, and adherence to rules and procedures are all strong indicators. Their desire to finish projects, even when challenging, and their careful preparation for tasks further solidify this rating.
