Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mixed picture regarding extraversion. While they express a desire for control and influence in social situations (e.g., taking over the dynamic in the work setting), they also seem to avoid social events that don't directly benefit them (e.g., declining the launch party). Their frustration with colleagues' lack of attention to their expertise suggests a preference for being heard and valued in social contexts. However, their discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and inclination to avoid unnecessary social interaction point towards a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays high conscientiousness across various scenarios. They exhibit strong organization skills (e.g., meticulous about putting equipment back in place), a dedication to thoroughness and accuracy (e.g., focusing on website backups), and a tendency to prioritize work responsibilities (e.g., prioritizing work over social events). Their willingness to take on challenging tasks and their focus on achieving success (e.g., getting the website up on time) further solidify their high conscientiousness.
