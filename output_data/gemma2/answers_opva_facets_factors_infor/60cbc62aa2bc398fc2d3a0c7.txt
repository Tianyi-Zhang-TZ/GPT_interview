Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and engagement. They enjoy socializing with coworkers, leading group discussions, and initiating conversations with strangers. While they acknowledge past shyness, their current behavior indicates a comfortable level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a mix of conscientious and less conscientious tendencies. They express a desire for organization and challenge themselves with complex tasks, highlighting their diligence. However, their ADHD and occasional struggles with detail-orientation suggest areas where they could benefit from increased conscientiousness.  Their willingness to ask for help and their dedication to completing tasks despite challenges demonstrate a strong work ethic.
