Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as both introverted and extroverted, preferring listening over leading but actively engaging in social situations. They enjoy social events but find them draining after a day of phone calls and meetings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the higher end. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness throughout the responses. They prioritize organization, detail-oriented tasks (even if challenging), and meeting deadlines. They take responsibility for their work and strive for excellence, even if it requires extra effort. Their emphasis on planning, diligence, and achieving goals points towards a high score in conscientiousness.
