Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as an introvert at heart and often experiences anxiety in social situations. While they acknowledge a desire to be social and engage in conversations, their preference for smaller groups and their need to "warm up" to new people suggest a lower score on Extraversion. However, their willingness to take on leadership roles in discussions and their understanding of the importance of social events for bonding indicate a moderate level of Extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high Conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and proper procedures in their work, exhibit diligence and attention to detail, are reliable and committed to completing tasks, and display a strong work ethic. Their self-awareness regarding potential pitfalls and their deliberate approach to decision-making further support a high Conscientiousness rating.
