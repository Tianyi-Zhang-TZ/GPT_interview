Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially uncomfortable. They actively seek out conversation and enjoy the company of others.  However, their preference for more casual group discussions without a designated leader suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They aren't necessarily seeking the spotlight or dominating conversations. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with high conscientiousness. They are detail-oriented, organized, and value completing tasks thoroughly. Their commitment to putting things back in their proper place, their diligence in tackling a challenging plumbing project, and their focus on accuracy in detail-oriented tasks all point towards a strong conscientiousness score.
