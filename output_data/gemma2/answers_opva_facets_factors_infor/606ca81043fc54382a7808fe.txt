Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and enjoys being around people. They actively seek out opportunities to connect with others, even in unfamiliar situations. Their descriptions of feeling comfortable and engaging in conversations at the party and after-work social event suggest a comfortable level of extraversion. However, they also acknowledge their initial shyness, indicating that their extraversion might not be extremely high. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize organization, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. Their descriptions of their efforts to organize tools, carefully complete tasks, and strive for accuracy point towards a highly conscientious personality. Their desire to avoid mistakes and feelings of anxiety when facing challenging tasks further support this assessment.
