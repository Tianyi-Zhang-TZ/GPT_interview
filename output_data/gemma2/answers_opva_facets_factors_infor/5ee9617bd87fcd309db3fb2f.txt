Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a strong preference for social interaction, enjoys meeting new people, and actively seeks out social events. Their descriptions highlight a comfortable and engaged presence in social settings, suggesting a high level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a commitment to organization and order in their workspace, and expresses a willingness to put in effort when tasks are important, there are also indications of occasional impulsivity and a tendency to prioritize relationships and emotional needs over strict adherence to rules or procedures. This suggests a conscientiousness score that is above average but not exceptionally high.
