Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "very outgoing" and comfortable initiating social interactions, even in unfamiliar settings. They enjoy social events, particularly those involving activities like watching baseball. However, they also express a preference for maintaining professional boundaries and not getting too close to colleagues outside of work. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the outgoing side but with some reservation.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. They prioritize putting things away, value clear procedures, and actively seek solutions to problems. Their anecdote about the NASA moonroof project highlights their meticulousness and commitment to accuracy. They also express a preference for thoughtful action over impulsive decisions.  These traits strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
