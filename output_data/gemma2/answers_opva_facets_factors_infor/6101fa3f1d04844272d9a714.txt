Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes themselves as "reserved" and introverted, they also demonstrate a capacity for social engagement when necessary. They highlight their ability to become "very outgoing" in new social situations and enjoy connecting with people. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the higher end.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes traits associated with conscientiousness: organization, diligence, attention to detail, a strong work ethic, and a desire to be reliable and accountable. Their answers consistently highlight their commitment to thoroughness, planning, and following through on tasks. This points to a very high level of conscientiousness.
