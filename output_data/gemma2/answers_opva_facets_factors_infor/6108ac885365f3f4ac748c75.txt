Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual demonstrates a desire to be more charismatic and outgoing in social situations, they primarily describe themselves as shy and preferring smaller, close-knit groups.  Their preference for staying home and avoiding after-work events suggests a lower inclination towards social engagement typical of higher extraversion. However, their willingness to take on leadership roles in academic settings and their attempts to be more outgoing in social situations hint at some extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They are organized, detail-oriented, hardworking, diligent, and value perfectionism. They prioritize completing tasks meticulously and strive to avoid mistakes. Their strong sense of responsibility and willingness to take on extra work for the benefit of others further support a high conscientiousness score.
