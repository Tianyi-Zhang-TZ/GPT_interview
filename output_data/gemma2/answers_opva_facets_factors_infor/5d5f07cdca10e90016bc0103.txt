Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for smaller social settings and initially feels uncomfortable in unfamiliar situations. While they recognize the importance of networking, they also prioritize personal commitments. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. They are goal-oriented, take responsibility for their work, and strive for accuracy. Their actions demonstrate a strong commitment to their tasks and a desire for excellence.
