Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as shy and reserved, particularly in social situations outside of work. While they acknowledge they can warm up and engage in conversations, their initial inclination is to observe and listen rather than take the lead. This suggests a lower level of extraversion. However, their willingness to participate in group discussions and their increasing comfort with after-work social events hint at some degree of extraversion that may develop over time. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness. They emphasize organization, tidiness, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. They take pride in completing tasks meticulously and avoiding mistakes. Their commitment to diligence, even when facing challenging tasks, further reinforces their conscientious nature.
