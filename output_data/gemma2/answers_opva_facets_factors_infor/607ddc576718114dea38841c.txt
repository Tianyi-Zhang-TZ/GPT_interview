Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as an introvert who enjoys connecting with people and building trust. While they demonstrate a desire for social connection and engagement, their preference for smaller groups and their emphasis on one-on-one interactions suggest a lower level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently portrays themselves as organized, detail-oriented, reliable, and dedicated to completing tasks meticulously. They express a strong sense of responsibility and a drive to achieve excellence. Their answers clearly indicate high levels of diligence, organization, and a tendency towards perfectionism.
