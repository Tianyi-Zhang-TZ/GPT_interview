Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual describes themselves as outgoing and enjoys social events, their response to the first question reveals a tendency towards discomfort and shyness in unfamiliar social settings. This suggests a level of extraversion that fluctuates depending on the situation.  Their answer to Question 5 also hints at a preference for avoiding potentially uncomfortable social situations (the Christmas party). Overall, their self-description leans towards extraversion, but the situational discomfort suggests a score closer to the middle range.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness across several responses. They prioritize organization, cleanliness, diligence, attention to detail, and taking responsibility in various situations. Their desire to contribute to their team and their efforts to maintain a positive and supportive work environment further reinforce their conscientious nature. The answers to Questions 2, 4, 6, and 7 clearly illustrate their commitment to these values.
