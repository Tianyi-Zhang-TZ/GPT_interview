Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, particularly as they have matured. They express comfort in conversations and show a desire to network and meet new people. However, they don't appear to be the life of the party or constantly seeking social stimulation. Their preference for listening roles and occasional leadership suggests a balance between extroverted and introverted tendencies. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with high conscientiousness. They describe themselves as organized, detail-oriented, and diligent. They prioritize completing tasks meticulously and demonstrate a strong work ethic. Their commitment to academic success and athletic pursuits further supports this assessment.
