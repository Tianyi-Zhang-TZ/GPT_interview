Conscientiousness: 4.0

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as initially shy and uncomfortable in social situations, particularly when they don't know anyone. However, they also mention actively trying to become more open and engaging, and they describe themselves as extroverted in certain social settings, like after-work events. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the lower end.
