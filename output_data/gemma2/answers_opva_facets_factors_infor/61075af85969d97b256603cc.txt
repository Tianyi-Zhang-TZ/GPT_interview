Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. While they acknowledge being an introvert and preferring listening over speaking, they also describe enjoying social events and being the "light of the party" during their time with the dance company. Their comfort in new social situations and willingness to engage with others suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of conscientiousness. They emphasize their strong work ethic, thoroughness, organization, diligence, and honesty. They prioritize completing tasks accurately and efficiently, seeking help when needed rather than leaving things unfinished. Their self-awareness and commitment to personal growth further reinforce this trait.
