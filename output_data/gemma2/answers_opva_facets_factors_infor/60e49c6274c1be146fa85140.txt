Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses some discomfort in unfamiliar social settings initially, they also highlight their ability to be outgoing and build connections once comfortable. Their enjoyment of networking events and their role in leading a virtual conference discussion suggest a preference for social interaction and engagement, leaning towards the higher end of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, meticulously plan events, pay close attention to detail, and strive for accuracy and completion. Their dedication to their work, willingness to take on additional responsibilities, and self-driven nature further support a high rating in conscientiousness.
