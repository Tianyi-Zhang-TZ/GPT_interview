* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to initiate social interaction, even in unfamiliar settings (e.g., the pre-med Honor Society mixer). They also enjoy group discussions and actively participate in them. However, there are instances where they express initial hesitation in social situations (e.g., the Christmas party).
