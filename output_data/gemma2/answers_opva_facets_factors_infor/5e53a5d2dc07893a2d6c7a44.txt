Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual mentions feeling more extroverted in familiar settings and enjoys socializing with the right crowd, their preference for skipping after-work events and generally keeping their professional and personal life separate suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They are not averse to social interaction but seem to prefer more controlled and intentional social engagement.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness throughout their responses. They emphasize organization, meticulous attention to detail, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. Their desire for perfectionism, diligence in learning new skills, and tendency to take responsibility for their actions all point towards a highly conscientious personality.
