Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes enjoying social events and feeling comfortable in some social situations, they also express a preference for solitude at times and a reluctance to engage in certain types of social gatherings (e.g., the Halloween party). This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. Their willingness to volunteer to buy drinks for their team suggests a level of sociability, but the emphasis on personal enjoyment and a desire to avoid "rudeness" hints at a preference for controlled social interactions.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and order, value accuracy and attention to detail, and show a strong sense of responsibility and diligence in completing tasks. Their willingness to push themselves through a challenging marathon and their meticulous approach to handling rent payments at the front desk further support this assessment.
