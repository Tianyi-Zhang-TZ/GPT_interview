Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual mentions feeling social anxiety in unfamiliar situations, they also describe actively trying to "turn on their extroverted personality" to make the best of it. This suggests a desire for social connection and a willingness to engage, even when feeling uncomfortable.  Their preference to decline the after-work social event due to the team's dynamic points to a more selective approach to social interaction rather than a complete aversion to it.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. They take pride in their ability to manage complex tasks, prioritize effectively, and follow through diligently. Their descriptions of their past roles highlight their commitment to accuracy, thoroughness, and a desire to meet expectations. Their willingness to seek help when needed also demonstrates self-awareness and a focus on achieving the best outcome, rather than solely relying on personal effort.
