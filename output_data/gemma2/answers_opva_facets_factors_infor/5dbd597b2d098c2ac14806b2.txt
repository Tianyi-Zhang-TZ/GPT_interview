Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally extroverted, particularly in their younger years. They enjoy meeting new people and engaging in social situations. However, their preference for work-life separation and discomfort with excessive social interaction suggests a moderate level of extraversion rather than a highly outgoing personality.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness throughout their responses. They prioritize organization, routine, diligence, and attention to detail. Their emphasis on self-discipline, avoiding mistakes, and working hard to achieve goals points towards a strong conscientious personality. Their aversion to impulsivity and preference for ethical work practices further solidify this assessment.
