Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.8

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes themselves as generally open and expressive, there are instances of shyness and discomfort in unfamiliar social situations (e.g., college play groups). This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not fully comfortable with all social settings. Their preference for listening and letting the group guide the conversation in discussions also points towards a less assertive, outward-directed personality. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates strong organizational tendencies and takes pleasure in orderliness. They also express a commitment to diligence and attention to detail in tasks, even if they sometimes struggle with frustration when facing challenges. Their planning and methodical approach to achieving goals further supports a high level of conscientiousness.
