Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual expresses discomfort in social situations with unfamiliar people, indicating a preference for smaller, more familiar social settings. While they acknowledge the potential enjoyment of social events, they often express anxiety and a desire to avoid them. This suggests a lower level of Extraversion. However, there are instances where they display enthusiasm and leadership qualities in social contexts (e.g., rallying their team during a game). This hints at a moderate level of Extraversion, not extremely low but not highly outgoing either.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits associated with Conscientiousness. They value organization, completing tasks, and paying attention to detail (evident in their descriptions of work and study habits). They also show a willingness to push themselves and strive for improvement (e.g., the go-karting example).  Their desire to achieve goals and maintain a sense of control suggests a strong conscientiousness.
