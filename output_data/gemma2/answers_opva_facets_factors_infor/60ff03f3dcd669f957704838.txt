Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual expresses a desire to be friendly and outgoing in social situations, particularly at work events, there's also an indication of preferring a listening role in group discussions and a tendency to overthink before speaking. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the introverted side. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize organization, meticulousness, diligence, and a strong sense of responsibility.  Their focus on detail, preparedness, and desire to help others while avoiding mistakes strongly point towards a high conscientiousness score.
