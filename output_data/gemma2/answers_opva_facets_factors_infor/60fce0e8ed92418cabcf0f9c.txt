Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes feeling anxious and insecure in new social situations, they also express a desire to be talkative and outgoing in the right circumstances. They acknowledge their tendency to be a "leading role" in group discussions when comfortable and confident. Their willingness to push themselves to attend after-work social events, despite anxiety, suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness. They express a strong concern for accuracy and detail in their work, exhibiting perfectionistic tendencies. They describe themselves as diligent, hard-headed, and driven to succeed. Their willingness to ask for help when needed, while still striving for self-sufficiency, further highlights their conscientious nature.
