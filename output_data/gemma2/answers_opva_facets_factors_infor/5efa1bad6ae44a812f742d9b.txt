Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and appears comfortable leading in group discussions. They describe themselves as talkative and enjoy being around people, indicating a high level of sociability. While they acknowledge feeling anxious in unfamiliar social settings, their drive to talk and get to know people suggests a desire for social engagement that outweighs initial discomfort. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a mix of organized and impulsive tendencies. They value organization and efficiency, as seen in their descriptions of being "nitpicky" and liking things organized. However, they also admit to being "hasty" and sometimes feeling anxious when faced with challenging tasks. This suggests a conscientiousness level that leans towards the middle ground, with strengths in organization but potential for impulsivity.
