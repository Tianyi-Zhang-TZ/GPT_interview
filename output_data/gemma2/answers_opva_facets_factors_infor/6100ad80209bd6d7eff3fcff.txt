Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally introverted, preferring smaller social circles. However, they demonstrate a willingness to step outside their comfort zone in unfamiliar social situations and actively engage. Their enjoyment of after-work social events and their leadership role in organizing them suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a strong sense of responsibility and organization. They value completing tasks thoroughly and leaving things in better shape than they found them. While they acknowledge not being detail-oriented in all situations, their willingness to push themselves when detail-oriented work is necessary points to a conscientious nature.
