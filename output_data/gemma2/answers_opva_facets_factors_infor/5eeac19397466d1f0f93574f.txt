Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially uncomfortable. They show a capacity for initiating interactions and finding common ground with others. Their enjoyment of after-work social events further supports this. However, they also acknowledge the challenges of driving to these events, suggesting a preference for social interactions that are more convenient. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, as seen in their preference for bringing their own supplies and returning borrowed items. They demonstrate diligence by persevering through a challenging task (mixer lifting) and paying close attention to detail in online surveys. Their willingness to help a struggling coworker and offer support highlights their sense of responsibility and thoughtfulness.
