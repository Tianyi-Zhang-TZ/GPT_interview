Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "not super outgoing" and prefers to take a listening role in group discussions.

They prioritize organization, enjoy putting things in order, and take pride in completing tasks thoroughly, even challenging ones. They also display diligence and attention to detail in their work, emphasizing the importance of accuracy. Their desire for a promotion and willingness to take on more responsibility further support a high rating in conscientiousness.
