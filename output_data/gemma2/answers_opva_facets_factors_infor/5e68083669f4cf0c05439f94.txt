Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "shy" and "quiet," preferring to be alone and needing to know someone before feeling comfortable around them. They also decline social events and describe themselves as "not really into going out." This indicates a preference for solitude and lower levels of sociability, aligning with a lower Extraversion score. However, their willingness to participate in discussions and express their opinions on important topics suggests some level of comfort in social situations, preventing a score in the lower range.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high Conscientiousness. They emphasize organization, attention to detail, meticulousness, and a strong drive for quality work. They prioritize putting things back in their place, carefully revise their writing, and strive to complete tasks systematically.  Their commitment to thoroughness and order points towards a high Conscientiousness score.
