Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as extroverted, bubbly, and enjoying social interaction. They mention feeling comfortable opening up in social settings, thriving on excitement, and being a "social butterfly." Their desire to lead in discussions and their enjoyment of after-work events further support a high score on extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual displays ambition, a strong work ethic, and a desire to pay attention to detail, there are hints of impulsivity and a tendency to be less focused at times. Their acknowledgment of needing to "check their impulse" and "tune in" suggests they may not always be as organized and disciplined as someone with a higher conscientiousness score.
