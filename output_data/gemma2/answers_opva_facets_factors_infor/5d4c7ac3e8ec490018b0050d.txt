Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially uncomfortable. They have overcome their shyness to participate in an open mic poetry group and seem to enjoy social interactions with colleagues. However, they also express a preference for smaller, more intimate settings and don't appear to be highly energized by large crowds or constant social stimulation. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual shows a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail, particularly in tasks requiring precision and accuracy. They describe taking care to avoid mistakes and demonstrate a commitment to learning new skills even when they find them challenging.  Their desire to help others and improve their work environment also points towards conscientiousness. While they admit to struggling with multitasking, their overall dedication to completing tasks thoroughly suggests a high level of conscientiousness.
