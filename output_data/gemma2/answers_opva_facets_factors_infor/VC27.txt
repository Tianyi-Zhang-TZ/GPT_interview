Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual expresses a clear preference for social settings, particularly those where they don't know anyone. They enjoy the novelty and lack of pre-existing social dynamics. Their descriptions of after-work social events and group discussions reveal a comfortable and active engagement with others.  However, they don't explicitly mention a strong need to be the center of attention or dominate conversations. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on organization, diligence, and attention to detail.  Their account of working in a factory highlights their adherence to protocols and their dedication to learning and improvement. They also express a desire to be thorough and accurate in their work, even when facing challenges. Their self-awareness about their procrastination tendencies suggests a desire for self-improvement and a commitment to being more organized.
