Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in a new social setting initially, but then actively tries to interact with people. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They seem open to social interaction but might prefer to observe and listen before fully engaging. Their enjoyment of after-work events and team projects further supports this moderate level.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their desire to do a good job, organize their work, pay attention to detail, and avoid mistakes. They describe themselves as patient, analytical, and critical of their own work. These traits strongly point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
