Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual mentions being a "quiet person" and preferring to listen, they also describe actively engaging in social situations, seeking out new people, and finding value in social events. Their willingness to step outside their comfort zone for fraternity recruitment and their understanding of the benefits of socializing suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. They prioritize putting things back in place, strive for accuracy in tasks, and are dedicated to seeing things through to completion. Their self-awareness and willingness to ask for help when needed further demonstrate conscientiousness.
