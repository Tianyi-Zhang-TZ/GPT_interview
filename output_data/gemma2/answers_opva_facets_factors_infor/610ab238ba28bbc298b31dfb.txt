Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction, particularly in work settings. They express enjoyment in attending social events, engaging in conversations, and building connections with colleagues. Their willingness to take on a leading role in group discussions and their comfort in social situations point towards a higher level of extraversion. However, their initial shyness when moving to a new country suggests some situational variability in their extroverted tendencies.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks diligently. Their examples illustrate a strong work ethic, a commitment to meeting deadlines, and a desire to produce high-quality work. Their willingness to take on additional responsibilities during a difficult time for their team further reinforces their conscientious nature.
