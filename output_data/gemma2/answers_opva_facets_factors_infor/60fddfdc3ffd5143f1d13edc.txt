Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and prefers to listen rather than talk in social situations. They also avoid after-work events when they don't know people well, indicating a preference for smaller, more familiar social settings. However, they do express a desire to be more positive and outgoing at work, suggesting some potential for extraversion to emerge in certain contexts.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. They prioritize orderliness, take pride in their work, and strive for accuracy. Their willingness to put in extra effort to achieve their goals and their awareness of the importance of work-life balance further support a high conscientiousness score.
