Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a preference for social interaction, describes themselves as an "extrovert," and thrives in social settings. They enjoy meeting new people, participating in group discussions, and attending social events. Their responses indicate a high level of energy and enthusiasm when interacting with others.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a strong work ethic, a commitment to responsibility, and a tendency towards detail-orientation, they also acknowledge their impulsive tendencies and past struggles with controlling their emotions. Their willingness to seek help when facing challenges and their self-awareness regarding their need for self-control suggest a level of conscientiousness that is above average but not exceptional.
