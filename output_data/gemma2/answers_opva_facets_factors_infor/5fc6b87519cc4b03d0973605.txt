**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations with unfamiliar people, preferring smaller groups and avoiding parties. They describe anxiety and a preference for working from home to avoid social interaction. This indicates a lower tendency towards sociability and assertiveness, characteristic of lower Extraversion.
