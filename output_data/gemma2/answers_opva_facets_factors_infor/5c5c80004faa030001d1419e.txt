Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a desire for social connection but also expresses anxiety and discomfort in unfamiliar social situations. They enjoy listening to others' ideas and participating in discussions but seem hesitant to take on a leading role. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a mixed picture. They describe themselves as diligent and hardworking when challenged, but also express a tendency to procrastinate and struggle with schoolwork.  They value organization and cleanliness but also admit to impulsiveness in online shopping. Overall, their conscientiousness appears moderate, with areas of both strength and weakness.
