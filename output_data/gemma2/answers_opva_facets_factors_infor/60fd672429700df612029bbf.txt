Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of extraversion. While they express discomfort in unfamiliar social situations and initially prefer solitude, they ultimately engage and enjoy social events with colleagues. Their willingness to participate in group discussions and their enjoyment of the after-work party suggest a capacity for social interaction and enjoyment. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits a high level of conscientiousness. Their responses consistently highlight a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and diligence. They prioritize completing tasks meticulously, value attention to detail, and demonstrate a commitment to fulfilling their obligations. Their willingness to go back and review training material, their efforts to help a coworker, and their decision to prioritize the needs of others over personal gain all point towards a highly conscientious personality.
