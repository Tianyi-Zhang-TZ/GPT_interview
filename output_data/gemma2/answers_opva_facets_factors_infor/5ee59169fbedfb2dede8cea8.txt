Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses enthusiasm for social interactions,  actively seeks out new connections, and enjoys being in situations that push them out of their comfort zone. Their language reflects a preference for social engagement and a comfort level with meeting new people.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a strong work ethic and a commitment to completing tasks carefully, there are hints of a preference for seeking support and guidance when facing challenging situations. Their willingness to ask for help and rely on others slightly lowers the conscientiousness score.  They also mention enjoying a good challenge but also appreciate a balance with tasks that don't require excessive attention to detail.
