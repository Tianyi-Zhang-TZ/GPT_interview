Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally easygoing and kind, but also mentions feeling quiet and reserved in unfamiliar social situations. They enjoy teaching and interacting with people in a structured setting (guitar lessons) but seem to prefer smaller, less intense social gatherings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to learn and improve, even when facing challenging tasks. They acknowledge their need to develop better attention to detail and show a desire to be helpful and supportive to their team members. While they sometimes struggle with organization and can be impulsive, their desire to learn and contribute suggests a conscientious personality.
