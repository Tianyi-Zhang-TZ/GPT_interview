Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion. While the individual describes engaging in social situations (making friends, participating in discussions), there's also an indication of some discomfort in unfamiliar social settings ("I was worried about my invitation...").  The responses don't strongly convey a preference for social interaction or a high level of assertiveness.

* **Conscientiousness:** The responses consistently point towards high conscientiousness. The individual demonstrates strong organization skills ("I try to let every detail..."), diligence ("I can't wait until we have a tendency to do whatever it took..."), attention to detail ("Driving test... I have to work very hard..."), and a sense of accomplishment from completing tasks meticulously.
