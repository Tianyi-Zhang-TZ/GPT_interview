Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual enjoys social events and connecting with people, their description of feeling "intimidated" and "reserved" in unfamiliar social settings suggests a preference for smaller, more familiar groups. Their tendency to take a "listening role" in discussions also points towards a less outwardly dominant personality.  

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of organization, diligence, and a desire for control. Their meticulous attention to detail, preference for completing tasks thoroughly, and commitment to following through on responsibilities all indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
