Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual initially identifies as an extrovert, their description of feeling more comfortable as an introvert and their tendency to withdraw in unfamiliar social settings suggests a leaning towards introversion.  Their enjoyment of social events with close friends and their ability to be the "life of the party" indicate a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. Their organized nature, attention to detail, and willingness to take charge in situations highlight their strong organizational skills and diligence. Their desire to avoid mistakes and their preference for thoroughness further support this assessment.
