Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when unfamiliar. They express a desire for social connection ("I miss thanks and I'm really good friends with a lot of people") and enjoy after-work social events. However, their response to the first question suggests some discomfort in unfamiliar social settings, indicating they might not be highly extroverted. Their enthusiasm for work and leadership roles also points towards a preference for social interaction in a purposeful context.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual shows a moderate level of conscientiousness. While they acknowledge their lack of organizational skills ("I'm not a handyman by any stretch"), they demonstrate a commitment to diligence and effort in challenging situations ("I think I was more and asphalt and to see the faces on the other people"). Their experience with Excel and attention to detail ("There's a lot of stuff... I had all my stuff if I want to get better for me to act like that early on") suggest a level of organization and precision. They also express a desire to support their team members and maintain a positive work environment, indicating a sense of responsibility.



Overall, the individual appears to be moderately extroverted and conscientious, with a preference for social interaction in a work-related context and a willingness to put in effort when faced with challenges.
