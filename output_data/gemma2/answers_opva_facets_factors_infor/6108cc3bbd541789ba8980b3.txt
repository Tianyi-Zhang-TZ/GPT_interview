**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even if initially feeling anxious. They actively seek to meet people and find ways to feel comfortable. Their enjoyment of after-work events and desire to socialize with colleagues also points towards a preference for social interaction. However, the initial anxiety and preference for smaller steps suggest they might not be highly extroverted. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, meticulousness, and attention to detail in their work. Their commitment to completing tasks thoroughly, even under pressure, and their diligence in following instructions highlight their strong work ethic. Their desire to be reliable and avoid mistakes further reinforces this trait.
