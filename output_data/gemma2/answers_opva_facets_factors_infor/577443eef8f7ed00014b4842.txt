Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.2 

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear comfort with social situations and enjoys meeting new people. Their experience as a missionary and their role as a moderator in focus groups showcase their sociability and ability to engage with others. However, their preference for family over a work social event suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not seeking out social interaction constantly.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays high levels of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. Their meticulous approach to work, commitment to finishing tasks, and adherence to procedures point towards a strong conscientiousness. Their willingness to put in extra effort and prioritize work responsibilities further reinforce this trait.
