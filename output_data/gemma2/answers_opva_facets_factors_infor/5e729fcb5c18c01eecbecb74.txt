Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for social interaction and appears comfortable in social settings when familiar with the people present. However, their experience in high school theater reveals a degree of shyness and timidity in unfamiliar social situations. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They enjoy social events and forming connections, but might not always be the first to initiate or dominate conversations in new environments.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits of organization, diligence, and a focus on detail. Their descriptions of work experiences at Jimmy John's and their involvement in the cross-country club highlight their ability to follow through on tasks, manage responsibilities, and strive for accuracy.  Their willingness to step outside their comfort zone and persevere through challenges in the cross-country club further demonstrates their conscientiousness.
