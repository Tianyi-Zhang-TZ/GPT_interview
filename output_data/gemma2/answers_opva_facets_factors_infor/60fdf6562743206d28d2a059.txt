Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual acknowledges feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations and sometimes prefers solitude, they also express a strong preference for social interaction and describe themselves as an extrovert overall. Their desire to lead discussions and engage with others points towards a higher level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize organization, order, attention to detail, diligence, and a preference for completing tasks thoroughly. Their descriptions of work habits and approach to challenges clearly align with a conscientious personality.
