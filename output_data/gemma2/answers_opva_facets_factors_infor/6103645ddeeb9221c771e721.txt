Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "outgoing" and enjoys socializing, but also admits to seeking comfort in familiar settings or having a friend present. They actively initiate conversations with people who seem withdrawn, suggesting a willingness to engage socially. However, the reliance on a friend in unfamiliar settings and preference for smaller gatherings indicate a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and tidiness, value completing tasks on time, and exhibit meticulous attention to detail. They also express a strong sense of responsibility, preferring to handle tasks independently rather than burdening others. Their commitment to deadlines and pursuit of perfection align with the core tenets of conscientiousness.
