Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual enjoys social interactions at work and describes themselves as outgoing and energetic, they strongly prefer a work-life balance and become introverted outside of work. They decline after-work social events and value quiet time for recharging. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the more introverted side.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness across several facets. They are highly organized, detail-oriented, and strive for perfection in their work. They are diligent, committed to finishing tasks, and prioritize planning and consideration in their actions.  Their preference for structure and control, coupled with their focus on accuracy and completion, strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
