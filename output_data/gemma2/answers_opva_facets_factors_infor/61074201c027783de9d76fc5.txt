Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as shy initially in social situations, particularly with unfamiliar people. They acknowledge feeling uncomfortable and hesitant to speak up. However, they also mention becoming more outgoing and talkative once they build relationships. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the lower end.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, follow instructions meticulously, are diligent in completing tasks (even when challenging), and strive for perfection in their work. Their examples from the restaurant job highlight their attention to detail, commitment to doing things correctly, and willingness to go the extra mile. They also display a strong sense of responsibility towards their team members, offering support and encouragement.
