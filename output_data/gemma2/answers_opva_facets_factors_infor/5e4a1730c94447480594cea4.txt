Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual acknowledges past social anxiety, they now actively engage in social situations and value networking with colleagues. Their enjoyment of after-work events and willingness to participate in group discussions suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization,  enjoy structured environments, and actively seek out challenging tasks to improve their skills. Their diligence, attention to detail, and tendency to plan rather than act impulsively further support a high rating in this domain.
