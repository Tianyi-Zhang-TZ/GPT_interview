Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual describes themselves as "loud and obnoxious" in social situations, this seems more like a coping mechanism for anxiety rather than genuine extroversion. Their preference for listening over leading in group discussions and avoidance of after-work social events suggest a lower level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates several traits consistent with high conscientiousness. Their emphasis on organization, neatness, diligence, attention to detail, and commitment to completing tasks thoroughly point towards this. Their willingness to work long hours and their fear of making mistakes that could cost the company money further solidify this assessment.
