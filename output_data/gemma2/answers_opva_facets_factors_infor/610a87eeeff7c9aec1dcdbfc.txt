Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to step outside their comfort zone in social situations, as seen in their experience moving to college. They acknowledge a preference for solitude but actively engage in social interactions when necessary. Their description of assuming a listening role in a study group also suggests a comfortable level of social participation. However, their preference for listening over leading and occasional feelings of discomfort in unfamiliar social settings indicate they are not highly extroverted.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a combination of conscientious and less conscientious tendencies. They express a desire to be organized and detail-oriented, as seen in their anecdote about the t-shirt blanket project. They also demonstrate a willingness to work hard and persevere through challenging tasks, evident in their experience with marching band. However, their admission to being uncomfortable with complex computer systems and their tendency to feel startled in unfamiliar situations suggest a lack of complete organization and composure.  


Overall, the individual appears to be moderately extroverted and moderately conscientious. They are capable of engaging in social situations and demonstrating diligence when necessary, but they also exhibit a preference for introspection and can be susceptible to feeling overwhelmed by unfamiliar or challenging situations.
