Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings, preferring to let others initiate conversations. While they can converse easily once engaged, their initial reluctance and preference for listening over leading in group discussions suggest a lower level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, diligently complete tasks even when challenging, pay close attention to detail, and strive for accuracy. Their reluctance to pass off work and preference for solving problems independently further support this rating.
