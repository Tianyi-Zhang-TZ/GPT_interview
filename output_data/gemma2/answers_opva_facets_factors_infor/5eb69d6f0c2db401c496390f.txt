Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations (e.g., attending the happy hour), their description leans towards a preference for careful observation and listening rather than dominating the conversation. They seem to find comfort in learning about others and contributing thoughtfully.  Their exhaustion after work suggests they may not always seek out social interaction. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They are meticulous about organization (putting equipment back in place), diligent in their approach to challenges (creating roadmaps and asking questions), and focused on details (paying attention to every point). Their desire to get things right and their tendency towards thoughtfulness point towards a strong conscientious personality.
