Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for reserved social interactions, acknowledging a desire to be more involved but not actively seeking it out. While they enjoy talking to people, they don't necessarily crave deep connections or being the center of attention. Their response to the after-work event highlights a tendency towards caution and prioritizing familiar company.  This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They exhibit strong organization skills, even when facing challenges, and demonstrate diligence and determination in completing tasks. Their meticulous attention to detail and commitment to accuracy further reinforce this. Their preference for carefully considering actions before impulsively acting also points towards a high level of prudence, a key aspect of conscientiousness.
