Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes themselves as "outgoing," they also acknowledge feeling more reserved in unfamiliar social situations. They actively seek out others who seem similarly uncomfortable, suggesting a preference for controlled social interactions rather than seeking the spotlight. Their enjoyment of work social events leans towards building rapport rather than purely socializing, hinting at a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness across several responses. They value organization, meticulousness, and taking a thoughtful approach to tasks. Their preference for research and due diligence before acting, coupled with their detail-oriented nature and desire to avoid mistakes, strongly points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
