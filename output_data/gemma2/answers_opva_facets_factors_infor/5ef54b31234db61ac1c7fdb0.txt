Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.8

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates a preference for listening over leading in social situations (Question 3) and often skips after-work social events due to shyness (Question 5).  While they express a desire to be more social, their current behavior suggests a lower level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently shows a desire to be organized and thorough (Questions 2 & 6). They demonstrate diligence in completing tasks, even challenging ones (Question 4), and value clarity and precision in work instructions (Question 6). Their willingness to help others and contribute positively to a team (Question 7) further supports a high conscientiousness score.
