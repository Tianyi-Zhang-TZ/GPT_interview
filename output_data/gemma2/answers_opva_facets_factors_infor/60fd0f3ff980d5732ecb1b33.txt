Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a moderate level of extraversion. While they initially express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings, they demonstrate a willingness to engage and value social connections, particularly with colleagues. Their participation in group discussions and preference for joining after-work events suggest a sociable nature. However, their description of feeling "a little tired" before these events hints at a preference for moderate social interaction rather than constant extroverted engagement. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits high conscientiousness. Their emphasis on organization, tidiness, diligence, and attention to detail strongly points towards this trait. They describe themselves as hardworking, value efficiency, and strive for accuracy in their work. Their willingness to push themselves during challenging tasks and their focus on completing work meticulously further solidify this rating.
