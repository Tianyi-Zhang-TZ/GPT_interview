Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates a desire for social connection and appears comfortable adapting their personality to different social situations.  Their willingness to "become a chameleon" and take on a more extroverted persona in unfamiliar settings suggests a moderate level of extraversion. However, they also express a preference for listening and asking questions in group discussions, indicating a balance between outgoingness and introspective tendencies.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization,  detail-orientation, and completing tasks thoroughly. Their commitment to putting things back in their proper place, seeking clarification on details, and diligently working towards goals all point towards a strong sense of responsibility and diligence. Their willingness to push themselves harder in challenging situations further reinforces this.
