Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as an introvert who enjoys socializing in small doses and stepping outside their comfort zone occasionally. They seem comfortable initiating conversations and engaging with others, but also value their personal time and don't seek constant social interaction. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. They prioritize completing tasks accurately and efficiently, strive for excellence in their work, and demonstrate self-discipline.  Their examples highlight their diligence, organizational skills, and commitment to avoiding mistakes. This points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
