Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual's responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion. While they acknowledge feeling more comfortable in social situations over time, their descriptions indicate a preference for smaller, more familiar settings. They express a lack of confidence in their public speaking abilities and describe themselves as not being "a very good speaker."  This suggests a moderate level of comfort with social interaction, leaning towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual's responses hint at a conscientious personality. They mention a desire to organize their workspace and express frustration when tasks require attention to detail. However, their struggles to recall specific examples and the somewhat rambling nature of their answers suggest a degree of disorganization and difficulty with focused effort. This indicates a level of conscientiousness that is present but not always consistently applied. 



**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be treated as tentative. A more comprehensive assessment would require a wider range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
