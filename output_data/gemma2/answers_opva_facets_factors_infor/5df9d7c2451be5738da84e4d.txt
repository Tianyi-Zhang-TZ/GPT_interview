Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mix of social comfort and preference for solitude. While they initially felt uncomfortable in social settings, they actively worked to overcome this and now enjoy interacting with people. However, they clearly prioritize personal time and social interaction outside of work, declining most after-work events. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness across various scenarios. They value organization, diligence, and attention to detail in their work. They strive for accuracy and completion, even when facing challenging tasks. They also show a desire to improve and learn, seeking to resolve issues independently before escalating them. Their strategic and thoughtful approach to achieving their goals further reinforces their conscientiousness.
