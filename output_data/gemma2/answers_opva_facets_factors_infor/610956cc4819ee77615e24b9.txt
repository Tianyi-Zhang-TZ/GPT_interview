Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as someone who typically prefers to keep to themselves and doesn't always go out of their way to express themselves. However, they also mention feeling "freed" and "authentic" in a new social environment, and express enjoyment in socializing with co-workers. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not strongly introverted but not highly outgoing either. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail (especially in flight training), diligence in completing tasks, and a strong sense of responsibility for safety. Their willingness to ask for help when overwhelmed and their focus on completing tasks safely and effectively further reinforce this high conscientiousness score.
