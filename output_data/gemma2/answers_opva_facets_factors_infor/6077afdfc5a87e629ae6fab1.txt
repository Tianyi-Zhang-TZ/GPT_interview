Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for social interaction and enjoyment, as seen in their desire to connect with colleagues and their enthusiasm for after-work events. However, they also acknowledge initial discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and a tendency to be more reserved initially. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits of organization, diligence, and a strong work ethic. They value cleanliness, order, and attention to detail, and strive for accuracy and high-quality work. Their willingness to take on challenging tasks and their self-awareness regarding areas for improvement (like impulsivity) further support a high conscientiousness score.
