* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally extroverted and enjoys social interactions.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual acknowledges the importance of organization and diligence, they also admit to struggles with these aspects. They describe themselves as hyperactive and sometimes forgetful, even when trying to be meticulous. Their impulsiveness and tendency to prioritize immediate gratification over long-term planning also suggest lower conscientiousness.
