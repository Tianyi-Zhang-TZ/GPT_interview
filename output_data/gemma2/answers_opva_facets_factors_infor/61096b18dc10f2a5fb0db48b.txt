Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual mentions being social at work and enjoying social events, they also express a preference for separation between work and personal life, rarely attending after-work gatherings.  This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, comfortable in social work settings but not necessarily seeking out extensive social interaction outside of work.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, seek clarification to ensure accuracy, display diligence in completing tasks, and value attention to detail. Their tendency to delegate challenging tasks when needed also reflects a thoughtful approach to responsibility.
