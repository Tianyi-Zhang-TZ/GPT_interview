Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally enjoying social situations and being able to be personable and charismatic in leadership roles. However, they also mention feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and preferring to be reserved at times. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not overly outgoing but comfortable and capable in social contexts when they feel at ease.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize their organizational skills, attention to detail, diligence in completing tasks, and tendency to follow through on commitments. They also express a desire to avoid mistakes and a willingness to put in extra effort to ensure success. These responses point towards a strong conscientiousness score.
