Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual's responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion. While they describe enjoying social interactions and taking leadership roles in family discussions, they also express a preference for familiar social settings and a need for personal space (skipping the after-work event).  Their answers don't consistently portray a strong desire for constant social stimulation or a preference for being the center of attention.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness. They emphasize their organizational skills, attention to detail, diligence in problem-solving, and commitment to completing tasks meticulously. Their desire to understand customer problems thoroughly and provide tailored solutions, coupled with their emphasis on following procedures and being a reliable team member, strongly point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
