Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "very extroverted" in their usual social circles, enjoys initiating conversations, and making jokes. However, they also mention feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and needing to work on their listening skills in group discussions. This suggests a level of extraversion that is strong in comfortable situations but can be less pronounced in new or challenging environments.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and organization. They prioritize putting things back in their place at work, are detail-oriented in their pharmacy role, and strive to complete tasks thoroughly. They also express discomfort passing off challenging tasks to others, indicating a preference for taking ownership and seeing things through. This pattern of behavior points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
