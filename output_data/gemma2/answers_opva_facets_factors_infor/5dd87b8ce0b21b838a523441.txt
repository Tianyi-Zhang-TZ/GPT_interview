Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations. They also express a preference for listening over leading in group discussions, suggesting a lower inclination towards extroverted behaviors. However, they do mention a desire to be accepted and a willingness to step outside their comfort zone occasionally. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the lower end.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize responsibility, organization, attention to detail, diligence, and a strong work ethic. They express a desire to do their best, meet expectations, and follow through on tasks. Their desire to maintain order and accuracy in their work, coupled with their proactive approach, points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
