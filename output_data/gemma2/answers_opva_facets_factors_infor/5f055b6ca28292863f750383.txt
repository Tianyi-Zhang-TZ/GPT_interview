Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as socially anxious and hesitant to put themselves out there in new social situations. They acknowledge that they've grown more comfortable over time, but initial discomfort suggests a lower level of extraversion.  While they do participate in discussions and try to make friends, their preference for smaller groups and avoidance of large parties indicates a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, neatness, and attention to detail in their work and personal life. They value completing tasks thoroughly and accurately, even if it takes longer. They are also diligent, preferring to solve problems independently and avoid relying on others. Their strong sense of responsibility and commitment to quality suggest a high level of conscientiousness.
