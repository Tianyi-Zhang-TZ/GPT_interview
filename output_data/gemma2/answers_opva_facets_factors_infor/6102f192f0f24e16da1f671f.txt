Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a desire for social connection and appears comfortable initiating interactions. They describe using compliments to build rapport and actively seek out connections in unfamiliar settings. However, they also acknowledge feeling anxiety in those situations and taking breaks to manage their discomfort. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not fully comfortable with constant social engagement but seeking connection nonetheless.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits of organization, diligence, and a strong work ethic. They prioritize completing tasks carefully, strive for accuracy, and demonstrate a commitment to exceeding expectations.  They also show a preference for considering the long-term consequences of their actions and value integrity. These responses strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
