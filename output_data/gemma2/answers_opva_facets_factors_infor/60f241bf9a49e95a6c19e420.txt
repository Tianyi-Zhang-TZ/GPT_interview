Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as "reserved," "shy," and preferring one-on-one interactions. They also indicate a preference for staying home over social events. While they acknowledge enjoying meeting new people, their overall demeanor suggests a lower tendency towards extroversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize organization, perfectionism, diligence, and a strong work ethic. They strive for accuracy, take pride in completing tasks meticulously, and seek help when needed rather than leaving things undone. Their commitment to leaving things better than they found them further supports this rating.
