Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially uncomfortable. They express enjoyment in meeting new people and building relationships at work. Their desire to be a "coach" and "facilitator" in group discussions also points towards extraversion. However, they do acknowledge moments where they prefer to be more reserved.  The overall balance leans towards extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently shows traits of organization, diligence, and attention to detail. Their experience fixing the Xerox machine, perseverance with the textured ceiling, and emphasis on accuracy in their work all point towards high conscientiousness. Their desire to triple-check things and seek feedback also reinforces this.  Their frustration with the unposted job opening suggests a preference for structure and fairness, further supporting conscientiousness.
