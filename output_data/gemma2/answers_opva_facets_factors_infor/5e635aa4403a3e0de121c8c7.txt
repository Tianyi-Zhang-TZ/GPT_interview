**Extraversion: 6/10**

* **Evidence:** The candidate displays some extroverted tendencies like wanting to be the center of attention, taking charge, and enjoying social interaction (though with initial shyness). 
* **Counter-Evidence:** There are also instances of introversion, like preferring to observe before engaging socially and needing time alone to recharge (e.g., the "after-work social event" response).

**Conscientiousness: 8/10**

* **Evidence:** The candidate consistently demonstrates strong conscientiousness. They are organized, detail-oriented, strive for perfection, and take pride in completing tasks thoroughly (inventory management, Excel spreadsheet). They are also reliable and responsible.
* **Counter-Evidence:** The impulsive act of smoking despite work pressure slightly lowers the conscientiousness score.
