Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual demonstrates some comfort in social settings (e.g., the meeting example), there's also a sense of calculated engagement, particularly in situations where they feel pressure (e.g., the after-work event). Their focus on achieving goals and contributing to the company suggests a preference for task-oriented activities over purely social ones.  

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, diligence, and a strong work ethic. Their examples highlight a commitment to completing tasks thoroughly and responsibly, even when faced with challenges.
