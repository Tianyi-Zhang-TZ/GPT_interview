Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. While they acknowledge feeling shy and reserved in new social situations, they also express a willingness to initiate conversations and make friends. Their enjoyment of group activities and role-playing as a cheerleader suggests a comfort level with social interaction, but their preference for listening initially and speaking up only when passionate about a topic hints at a less outgoing nature. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits indicative of high conscientiousness. They describe themselves as organized, detail-oriented, and dedicated to completing tasks thoroughly. Their emphasis on perfectionism, diligence, and responsibility further support this assessment. Their willingness to take on challenging tasks and their independent work style also align with conscientiousness.
