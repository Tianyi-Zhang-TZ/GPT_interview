Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual describes initial shyness in new social situations, they demonstrate a willingness to engage and eventually become comfortable. Their involvement in the local music scene and leadership role in work discussions suggest a capacity for social interaction and even leadership.  The fact that they enjoy social events with familiar colleagues further supports a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. Their emphasis on organization, tidiness, diligence, attention to detail, and adherence to instructions paint a picture of someone who is responsible, reliable, and goal-oriented. Their pursuit of professional development (screenwriting course) and dedication to their work (three-book contract with Del Rey) further solidify this impression.
