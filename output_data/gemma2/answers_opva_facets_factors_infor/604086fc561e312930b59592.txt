Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a clear preference for social interaction and engagement. They express enjoyment in talking to people, leading groups, and attending social events. While they admit to feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings, this seems like an exception rather than the rule. Their enthusiasm for company events and their comfort in leading group discussions point towards a higher extraversion score.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They describe themselves as hardworking, dedicated, organized, and detail-oriented. Their actions, such as diligently completing tasks, returning equipment promptly, and paying attention to detail in their work, further support this assessment. Their willingness to push through challenges and learn independently also reflects a strong sense of diligence.
