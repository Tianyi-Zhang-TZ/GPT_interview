Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates some discomfort in social situations where they don't know people (Question 1). While they try to be friendly, they express feeling uncomfortable and unsure how to navigate the situation. This suggests a lower level of comfort with social interaction. However, they do take initiative in leading a group discussion (Question 3) and appear to enjoy contributing ideas.  They also show a willingness to uplift their team members (Question 7), indicating some social engagement.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize accuracy and attention to detail in their work (Questions 2, 6), demonstrate diligence and responsibility in handling challenging tasks (Question 4), and show a preference for following rules and doing the right thing (Question 8). Their focus on organization and completing tasks carefully points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
