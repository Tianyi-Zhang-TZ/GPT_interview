Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a moderate level of extraversion. While they express some discomfort in unfamiliar social situations, they also demonstrate a willingness to engage and participate in social events, particularly those with colleagues. Their desire to build relationships and their enjoyment of casual social interactions suggest a preference for social stimulation. However, they don't appear to be highly outgoing or assertive in seeking out social experiences.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits a high level of conscientiousness. They demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility, a commitment to order and organization, and a tendency towards diligence and attention to detail. Their willingness to ask for help when facing a challenging task reflects a realistic assessment of their capabilities and a desire to complete tasks effectively. Their concern for the well-being of their team members and their efforts to raise their spirits further illustrate their conscientious nature.
