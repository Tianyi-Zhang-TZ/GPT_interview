Here's an analysis of the provided responses and suggested ratings for Extraversion and Conscientiousness:

**Extraversion: 4** 

While the individual describes herself as "reserved" in strictly social situations, her enjoyment of group activities with students (like the dance competition) and her willingness to participate in school events suggests a level of extraversion that leans towards the higher end. Her desire to be part of things and support causes she believes in also points to this.

* **Diligence:**  The description of her commitment to National Board Certification, despite its challenges, highlights her dedication and perseverance.
* **Sociability:**  While she prefers certain social situations, her willingness to support colleagues and participate in events like the student dance competition shows a conscientious approach to teamwork and community.
* **Perfectionism:**  Her meticulous planning for field trips, attention to detail, and desire for clear schedules demonstrate a strong drive for order and accuracy.
* **Liveliness:** Her willingness to act impulsively when it benefits her students or school goals, while still recognizing the need for prudence in other situations, shows a balance of enthusiasm and careful consideration.
