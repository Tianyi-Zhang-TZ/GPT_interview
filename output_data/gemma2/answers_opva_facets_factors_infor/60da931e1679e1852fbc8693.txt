Extraversion: 2.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as introverted and uncomfortable in social situations with unfamiliar people. They prefer solitude and alone time, indicating a preference for internal stimulation over external social interaction. Their enjoyment of quiet activities and discomfort with large social gatherings further support a lower score on extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates several traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, putting things back in place, and demonstrating respect for order. They also express a strong work ethic, focusing on details to avoid mistakes and pushing themselves when interested in a task. Their desire to be prepared and plan for the next day also aligns with conscientiousness.
