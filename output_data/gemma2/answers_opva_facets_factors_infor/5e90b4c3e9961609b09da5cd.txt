Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and socially awkward in new situations. They mention putting on an "extroverted face" to appear comfortable, but ultimately prefer to be around familiar people. While they enjoy connecting with people on a deeper level, they don't seem to actively seek out social situations.  This points towards a lower score on Extraversion. 
* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They take responsibility for their actions (putting tools away, fixing the log splitter), prioritize organization (putting tools back in place), and display diligence (fixing the log splitter despite lack of prior experience). They also value attention to detail (driving safely) and self-control (resisting sugary food while trying to lose weight). These examples suggest a strong inclination towards conscientious behavior.
