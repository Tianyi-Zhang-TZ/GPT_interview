Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally withdrawn and preferring to avoid social situations, especially unfamiliar ones. While they are working on becoming more outgoing, their current behavior suggests a lower level of extraversion. However, they do show some willingness to step outside their comfort zone in certain situations, like training colleagues or attending social events with friends. This hints at a potential for increased extraversion in the future.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They are detail-oriented, organized, and prefer to take their time to complete tasks meticulously. They also value accuracy and strive for high-quality work. Their willingness to push themselves through challenging tasks like assembling a bed frame further supports this assessment.
