Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and loud with known people, they express feeling introverted and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the introverted side. Their willingness to push themselves to be less introverted in certain situations indicates a potential for increased extraversion under specific circumstances.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness across several examples. They prioritize organization, diligently complete tasks, pay close attention to detail, and strive for accuracy. Their tendency to overthink and avoid mistakes further reinforces their conscientious nature. They also express a desire to help others and raise their spirits, suggesting a level of responsibility and consideration for others.
