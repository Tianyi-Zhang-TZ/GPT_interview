Extraversion: 4.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses high levels of sociability, enthusiasm, and a preference for social interaction. They describe themselves as "super extroverted," "outgoing," and "bubbly," and enjoy meeting new people and leading discussions. Their answers to questions about social events and group dynamics clearly indicate a strong preference for extroverted behaviors. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates high levels of organization, diligence, and a focus on detail. They describe themselves as "respectful of other people's information," "detail-oriented," and "perfectionistic." They also express a strong work ethic and a willingness to challenge themselves. While they don't explicitly mention being highly rule-abiding, their emphasis on order, accuracy, and planning points towards a conscientious personality.
