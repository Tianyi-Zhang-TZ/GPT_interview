Conscientiousness: 4.0

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as initially shy and reserved in new social situations, but warming up over time. They enjoy social events after work and seem open to connecting with colleagues on a deeper level.  While they don't appear to be the most outgoing person, their willingness to engage and their enjoyment of social interaction suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

They value organization and efficiency, as seen in their preference for putting things back in place. They also show diligence and attention to detail, particularly when facing challenging academic tasks. Their desire to excel and their commitment to completing tasks thoroughly point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
