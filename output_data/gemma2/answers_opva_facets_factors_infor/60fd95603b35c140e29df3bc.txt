Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes feeling uncomfortable in new social situations initially, they ultimately seek out and engage in social events (e.g., the happy hour) and demonstrate leadership qualities in group discussions. Their willingness to step into a leadership role and their recognition of the value of networking suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their organizational skills, attention to detail, diligence, and preference for completing tasks thoroughly. They express a strong sense of responsibility for their work and a commitment to accuracy. These traits strongly point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
