Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual expresses a clear enjoyment of social settings, new experiences, and meeting new people. They describe themselves as "open-minded" and comfortable initiating conversations. While they admit to initial shyness, they actively work to overcome it and build relationships.  Their preference for attending social events even when busy further supports a higher extraversion score. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates some conscientious traits, such as striving for achievement and taking initiative in group projects. However, they also acknowledge tendencies towards procrastination and disorganization, particularly outside of work. Their description of themselves as "a little bit messy" and their admission to needing to "discipline" themselves in social situations suggest areas where they could improve on conscientiousness. 



It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited sample of self-reported data. A more comprehensive assessment would involve observing behavior and using standardized personality tests.
