**Extraversion: 5** 

The individual consistently demonstrates a preference for social interaction and engagement. They enjoy being around people, seek out social gatherings, and find humor and relatability to be important in connecting with others.  

**Conscientiousness: 4**

While the individual displays some traits of conscientiousness, like their attention to detail and desire to avoid mistakes, there are instances where impulsivity and a tendency to prioritize immediate gratification over long-term goals are evident.  For example, their reluctance to ask for clarification from their manager and their tendency to overthink situations suggest a degree of conscientiousness, but their willingness to skip work social events and their desire to leave work early despite financial responsibilities indicate a lower level of conscientiousness.
