Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.8

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as generally a "quiet person" who relies on others for comfort in social settings. While they demonstrate an ability to step outside their comfort zone and make connections, their preference for solitude and reliance on others suggest a lower level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, meticulously pack equipment, strive for accuracy, and demonstrate diligence in completing challenging tasks. Their self-awareness regarding their tendency to rush and overlook details, coupled with their efforts to improve, further strengthens this assessment.
