Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage with new people and initiate conversation, suggesting a level of comfort and enthusiasm in social situations.  They also express a desire to be present at social events, even when they initially lack enthusiasm, indicating a degree of social engagement. However, their description of feeling "a bit uncomfortable" in new social settings suggests a moderate level of extraversion rather than a highly extroverted personality.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays responsible and organized behavior. They prioritize cleaning up after themselves at work, showing a commitment to order and organization. They also demonstrate diligence in completing challenging tasks, even when they are initially reluctant. Their willingness to listen attentively in group discussions and their consideration for others' feelings further support a high level of conscientiousness.
