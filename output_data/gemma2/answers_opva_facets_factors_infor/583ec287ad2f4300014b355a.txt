Extraversion: 1.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations, prefers solitude, and avoids situations involving large groups of people. They describe themselves as introverted and even express dislike for social interaction.  Their reluctance to engage in small talk and their preference for avoiding events like skydiving further support a low score on Extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates some hesitation and fear in situations requiring meticulous attention to detail (like the mail merge), they generally come across as organized and capable. Their experience leading a project, successfully completing a complex data center move, and their willingness to delegate tasks when necessary suggest a high level of conscientiousness. Their description of themselves as "businesslike" and their focus on achieving project goals also point towards this trait.
