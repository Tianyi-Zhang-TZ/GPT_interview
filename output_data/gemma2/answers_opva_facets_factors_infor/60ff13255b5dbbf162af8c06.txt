**Extraversion: 2.5** 
**Conscientiousness: 4.0**

**Explanation:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone. They mention "having to be more outgoing" for work events, but prefer being with familiar people. While they acknowledge the importance of social interaction, their responses suggest a preference for smaller, more intimate settings. This leans towards the lower end of the Extraversion spectrum.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong preference for structure, organization, and attention to detail. They thrive in situations with clear expectations and enjoy completing tasks meticulously. Their descriptions of work experiences highlight their diligence, focus, and commitment to accuracy. This pattern strongly suggests a high level of Conscientiousness.
