Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even if they feel initially uncomfortable. They actively try to be friendly and approachable, initiating conversations and showing interest in others. Their enjoyment of after-work social events and desire for team cohesion further support this. However, they don't explicitly express a strong preference for being the center of attention or seeking constant stimulation. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, structure, and attention to detail. They demonstrate a strong work ethic, taking initiative, and striving for accuracy. They also show a willingness to learn and adapt, seeking clarification when needed. Their desire to help team members and prevent mistakes further highlights their conscientious nature.
