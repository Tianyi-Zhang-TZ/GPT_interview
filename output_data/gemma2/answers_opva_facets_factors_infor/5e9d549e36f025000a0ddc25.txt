Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.8

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual expresses enjoyment in social situations with familiar people, they also admit to feeling uncomfortable and isolated in unfamiliar social settings. Their preference for separating work and personal life, and their reluctance to engage in after-work social events, suggests a lower tendency towards social engagement and seeking out stimulation from others. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates responsible and organized behavior. They prioritize putting things back in place, taking on challenging tasks, and feeling a sense of satisfaction from completing work diligently. Their desire to avoid mistakes and focus on details points towards a strong sense of organization and a commitment to quality.  Their willingness to support and encourage team members further highlights their conscientious nature.
