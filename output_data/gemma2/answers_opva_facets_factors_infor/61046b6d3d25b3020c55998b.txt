Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally comfortable in social situations, able to chat easily with strangers and colleagues. They express a preference for collaboration and socializing as part of their work enjoyment. While they acknowledge feeling shy or hesitant to initiate in group discussions sometimes, their overall comfort and preference for social interaction point towards a higher Extraversion score.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates some conscientious traits. They describe taking notes during training, planning ahead for a presentation, and striving for accuracy in their work. However, they also admit to being impulsive at times, especially when lacking information. Their experience on the film set, where they relied on notes and improvisation due to a lack of proper training, suggests a potential for inconsistency in their organizational skills.  Their enjoyment of creative endeavors and willingness to experiment also lean towards a slightly lower Conscientiousness score.
