Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual mentions enjoying social events and having a good time with colleagues, their descriptions often focus on maintaining personal space and comfort in social situations. They don't express a strong desire to be the center of attention or initiate social interactions. Their preference for smaller, familiar groups and their comfort with their wife suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks diligently. Their descriptions of work routines, checklists, and careful consideration in handling sensitive information highlight their strong sense of responsibility and dedication to accuracy.  Their desire to improve work processes and their willingness to seek feedback further reinforce their conscientious nature.
