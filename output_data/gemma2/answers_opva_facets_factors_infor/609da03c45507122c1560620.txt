Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.8

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in social situations, preferring solitude, and expressing hesitation in approaching others. While they acknowledge a leadership role in discussions and a willingness to try new things at social events, these instances seem driven by a sense of obligation rather than genuine enthusiasm.  Their tendency to avoid social interaction and discomfort in unfamiliar settings point towards a lower score on Extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates several traits consistent with high Conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, meticulously clean and put things away, and exhibit a strong work ethic, even when feeling overwhelmed. They also express a desire to complete tasks accurately and avoid mistakes, highlighting their attention to detail and diligence. Their tendency to take on leadership roles and strive for success further support a high Conscientiousness score.
