Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses a desire for social connection and describes overcoming initial anxiety in social situations, their responses lean more towards preference for listening and observing in group discussions rather than actively leading. They also don't explicitly express a strong drive for excitement or social stimulation. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They value organization, detail-orientation, diligence, and follow-through. They prioritize accuracy in their work, seek to learn and improve, and demonstrate a strong work ethic.  Their emphasis on planning, careful decision-making, and avoiding negative consequences further reinforces this high conscientiousness score.
