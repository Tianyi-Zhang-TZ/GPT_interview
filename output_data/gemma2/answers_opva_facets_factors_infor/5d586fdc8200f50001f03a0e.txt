## Personality Rating Based on HEXCO Model:

**Extraversion: 2.0** 
**Conscientiousness: 3.5**

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a preference for solitude and avoids social situations. Phrases like "I am not a social Man of Steel," "I don't like contact with people," and "prepare to stay away from such thing" clearly indicate a low preference for social interaction. This, coupled with discomfort in unfamiliar social settings described in Question 1, points towards a lower score on Extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual's responses sometimes lack clarity and organization, there are strong indications of conscientiousness. The description in Question 2 about the chaotic work environment and the individual's struggle to resist the disorganization suggests a desire for order and structure.  Furthermore, the answers to Questions 4 and 7 demonstrate a strong work ethic, diligence, and a tendency to take responsibility and lead. The individual's focus on completing tasks efficiently and raising team spirits despite pressure points towards a higher score on Conscientiousness.
