Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a capacity for social engagement and comfort in new situations. Their experience transferring schools highlights their ability to adapt and build relationships, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion. However, their preference for socializing after work and their focus on work during social events indicate a preference for controlled social interaction rather than constant outward engagement.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. Their meticulous attention to detail, organizational skills, diligence in completing tasks, and self-discipline in prioritizing work over social events all point to a strong sense of responsibility and commitment.  Their desire to learn and improve, coupled with their attentiveness to instructions, further reinforce this assessment.
