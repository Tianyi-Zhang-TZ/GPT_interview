Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and appears comfortable in new situations. They actively seek out conversations and enjoy building connections with others. While they admit to feeling less comfortable when conversations stray from their interests, this doesn't negate their overall openness to social engagement. Their enjoyment of after-work events and desire to build trust within teams further supports this.
* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently highlights their organizational skills, attention to detail, and commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. They value structure, planning, and efficiency. Their descriptions of their work habits, their meticulous approach to scientific protocols, and their tendency to double-check details all point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
