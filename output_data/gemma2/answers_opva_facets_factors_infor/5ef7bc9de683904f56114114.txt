**Extraversion: 3.0** 

**Conscientiousness: 4.0**

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when unfamiliar. They express a desire to help others and contribute to group activities. However, they also mention not being "overly social" and preferring to have meaningful conversations rather than being the center of attention. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The answers consistently highlight traits associated with conscientiousness. The individual emphasizes organization, attention to detail, a strong work ethic, and a tendency to complete tasks thoroughly. They value efficiency, accuracy, and being reliable. Their examples of putting things back in place, double-checking numbers, and striving to finish challenging tasks all point to a high level of conscientiousness.
