Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone, preferring to be a listener rather than a leader, and sometimes choosing to skip social events. These responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, take pride in completing tasks carefully, strive for accuracy, and are motivated to achieve their goals. Their willingness to help team members and their desire to contribute to a positive work environment also align with conscientiousness.
