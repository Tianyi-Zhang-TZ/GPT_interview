Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of extraversion. While they express some discomfort in unfamiliar social situations, they also mention feeling comfortable socially and engaging in conversations. Their willingness to participate in a group discussion, albeit by listening, suggests a level of comfort with social interaction. However, their preference to skip a social event after work due to fatigue and desire for solitude hints at a preference for smaller social circles and a need for downtime.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits a high level of conscientiousness. They consistently describe themselves as organized, detail-oriented, and diligent in their work.  They prioritize completing tasks accurately and efficiently, even when faced with challenges. Their willingness to go the extra mile to help their team members and their commitment to following through on responsibilities further demonstrate their conscientious nature.
