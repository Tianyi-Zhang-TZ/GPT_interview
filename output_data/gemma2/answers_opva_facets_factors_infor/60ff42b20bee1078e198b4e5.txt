Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations and prefers to observe before engaging. They express a desire to avoid drawing attention to themselves and mention feeling anxious in situations requiring quick thinking and public interaction. These behaviors suggest a lower level of extraversion. However, they also demonstrate an ability to step outside their comfort zone and initiate conversations when necessary, indicating some level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, meticulously put things back in place, take initiative to learn new skills, and demonstrate diligence and perseverance in completing challenging tasks. They also value accuracy and attention to detail, as evidenced by their request for the trainer to slow down during the Excel training. Their commitment to completing tasks thoroughly and meeting deadlines further supports a high conscientiousness score.
