Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual expresses a clear enjoyment of social interaction and working with others. They describe feeling comfortable in social settings and actively seeking out opportunities to connect with people. Their desire to "make more friends" and their preference for open environments suggest a higher level of extraversion. However, their initial discomfort in the unfamiliar social setting hints at a possible lower end of the extraversion spectrum.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, meticulous attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. Their descriptions of their work experiences highlight their diligence, responsibility, and commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. They also express a desire for self-improvement and a proactive approach to learning new skills. These examples strongly suggest a high level of conscientiousness.
