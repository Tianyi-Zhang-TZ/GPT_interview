Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses a desire to make friends and engage in social situations, they also describe themselves as shy and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings. Their preference for familiar company and tendency to be quiet suggests a lower level of extraversion. However, their willingness to attend the after-work event and their talkativeness once comfortable with people indicate some degree of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, responsibility, dependability, diligence, and attention to detail. Their commitment to completing tasks thoroughly and their desire to maintain order point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
