Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5 

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses enjoyment in social settings, describes themselves as extroverted, and readily engages in conversations and leading roles within groups. Their preference for social interaction and comfort in unfamiliar social situations points towards a high extraversion score.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong organization skills and a tendency towards meticulousness in tasks like prescription work, they also acknowledge impulsivity when desiring something strongly.  Their willingness to prioritize immediate gratification over long-term goals suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness. Their  description of being "not the most patient" and acting impulsively to obtain desired things indicates a potential weakness in self-control, which is a key component of conscientiousness.
