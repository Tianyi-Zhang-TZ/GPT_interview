Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally comfortable in social situations, though they prefer to observe and wait for others to initiate conversation. They enjoy after-work social events and find comfort in familiar work environments. However, they don't describe themselves as the "life of the party" or someone who actively seeks out social interaction. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, strive for accuracy and attention to detail, and value completing tasks thoroughly. They are diligent in their work, seek help when needed, and demonstrate a commitment to meeting deadlines. Their calm and stable demeanor, coupled with their focus on positive feedback and support for their team, further reinforce their high conscientiousness.
