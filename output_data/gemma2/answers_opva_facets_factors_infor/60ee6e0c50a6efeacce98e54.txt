Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as initially shy and uncomfortable in social situations, particularly in unfamiliar settings. However, they demonstrate a willingness to push themselves outside their comfort zone (e.g., attending the fraternity pledge meeting, participating in the focus group, going to the after-work event). They also express a desire to be more social and outgoing, especially in a professional context. These factors suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They show diligence in training for the Spartan Race, meticulous attention to detail in the escape room, and a strong work ethic. They also express a desire to be organized and efficient, though they admit to struggles in that area.  Their ambition and drive to succeed in their career further support a high level of conscientiousness.
