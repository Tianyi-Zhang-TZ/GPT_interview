Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.2

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when uncomfortable, and actively seeks opportunities to connect with others (e.g., attending the goodbye party, networking at the fraternity recruitment). They also show a preference for leading and guiding in group discussions. These behaviors suggest a higher level of extraversion. However, there are instances where they express a need to be comfortable and prepared before engaging (e.g.,  the initial discomfort in the fraternity recruitment). This indicates a moderate level of extraversion rather than someone who thrives on constant social interaction.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and tidiness (e.g., gym equipment, internship application process), demonstrate diligence and perseverance (e.g., internship pursuit, project planning), and show a strong attention to detail (e.g., marketing plan, event organization). Their commitment to planning and following through on tasks, coupled with their emphasis on accuracy and efficiency, point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
