Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a tendency towards introversion in some situations (preferring to keep to themselves), but also shows a willingness to step outside their comfort zone and engage socially when necessary (e.g., making friends in college, assuming a listening role in study groups).  Their willingness to raise team spirits and their desire to be included in social events suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits a mix of conscientious and less conscientious behaviors. They describe instances where they struggled with technical equipment and admitted to being startled by unfamiliar systems. However, they also highlight their determination to improve in challenging situations (marching band), their attention to detail when crafting a t-shirt blanket, and their desire to act responsibly as a lifeguard. This combination suggests a moderate level of conscientiousness. 



**Important Note:** These ratings are based on a limited set of self-reported anecdotes. A more comprehensive assessment of personality would require standardized questionnaires and potentially behavioral observations.
