Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a strong preference for social interaction, enjoyment of meeting new people, and a tendency to be outgoing and take on leadership roles in group settings. Their descriptions highlight a vibrant social personality and a comfort level in social situations, even when initially unfamiliar.  

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a capacity for meticulous attention to detail and a strong work ethic, they also acknowledge a history of impulsivity and a need to consciously control their actions.  Their willingness to seek help when facing challenging tasks and their efforts to manage their impulsiveness suggest a level of conscientiousness that is present but not always fully consistent.
