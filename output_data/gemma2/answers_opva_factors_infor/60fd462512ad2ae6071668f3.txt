Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally shy and introverted, preferring to listen in conversations and avoiding social situations where they don't know anyone. However, they also mention being able to be extroverted if they choose, and they enjoyed the social aspect of the after-work event with free food. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the introverted side.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness. They prioritize orderliness, take pride in completing tasks thoroughly, and feel guilty about leaving things messy. They also describe themselves as a "neat person" and someone who follows rules diligently.  Examples include:

    *  Always putting equipment back in place at work.
    *  Taking on a challenging task despite finding it difficult.
    *  Following instructions carefully even when dealing with a difficult customer.
    *  Not wanting to break work rules or take unauthorized breaks. 



These consistent examples point to a strong conscientious personality.
