Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mixed approach to social situations. While they acknowledge feeling more introverted in unfamiliar social settings, they also express curiosity about people and a willingness to engage in conversation.  Their preference for listening in group discussions and occasional use of humor suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently emphasizes the importance of organization, responsibility, and self-care. They describe themselves as meticulous, detail-oriented, and committed to following rules and procedures. Their awareness of their limits and the need for self-care in demanding situations further highlight their conscientious nature.
