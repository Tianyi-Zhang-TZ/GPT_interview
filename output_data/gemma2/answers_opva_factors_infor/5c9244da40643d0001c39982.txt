Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as generally quiet and reserved in social situations, preferring to observe before engaging. They acknowledge feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and describe themselves as potentially appearing "cold" or "standoffish" to others. While they can be more outgoing with familiar colleagues in relaxed settings, their preference for observation and reserved nature suggest a score closer to the lower end of the Extraversion spectrum. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize order and organization, feel strongly about putting things back in place, and exhibit meticulous attention to detail in their work. They are driven to learn and grow, taking initiative to research and understand challenging tasks. They also seek feedback to ensure accuracy and demonstrate a strong work ethic. These patterns point to a high score on conscientiousness.
