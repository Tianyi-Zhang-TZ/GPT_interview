Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 2.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling more comfortable and expressive in social settings where they know people. They also mention enjoying the freedom of choice in social situations and feeling comfortable leading group discussions. These responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual expresses a desire to be organized and complete tasks, they also admit to feeling stressed by detailed tasks and sometimes struggling with motivation to finish them. Their tendency to avoid conflict and not feel obligated to comfort others suggests a lower level of conscientiousness. 



It's important to remember that these are just preliminary ratings based on limited information. A more comprehensive assessment would involve using standardized personality tests and gathering additional data about the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
