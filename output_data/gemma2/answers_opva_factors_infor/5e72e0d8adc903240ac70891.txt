**Extraversion: 4** 

* **Evidence:** The individual frequently mentions enjoying social events, parties, and interacting with people from different backgrounds. They express a desire to "hang out and party" and describe themselves as someone who likes to socialize.  They also demonstrate comfort in interacting with superiors in a social setting. 

**Conscientiousness: 3**

* **Evidence:** While the individual expresses a strong sense of responsibility and finishing tasks ("I believe in finishing things...I wouldn't feel happy about passing it off"), they also admit to finding detailed-oriented work tedious and not enjoyable. They describe themselves as "not that vocal" and not someone who rallies troops.  This suggests a balance between responsibility and a preference for less structured tasks.
