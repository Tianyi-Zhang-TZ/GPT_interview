Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally comfortable in social situations, even though they acknowledge past awkwardness. They enjoy leading in online gaming and participating in after-work social events with colleagues.  They also demonstrate a willingness to lighten the mood and boost team morale when needed. These responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes organization, planning, and attention to detail. They describe a preference for a tidy work environment and a methodical approach to tasks. They also highlight their commitment to completing tasks thoroughly and efficiently, even challenging ones.  Their aversion to impulsivity and preference for thoughtful decision-making further support a high conscientiousness score.
