Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5 

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as initially shy and reserved in new social situations but warming up over time. They enjoy social events after work and find them opportunities to connect with colleagues on a deeper level. They also express a willingness to listen and support others, indicating some extroverted tendencies. However, their initial shyness and preference for observing before engaging suggest they are not highly extroverted.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong work ethic, seeking out guidance and learning new tasks efficiently. They describe being detail-oriented and focused when necessary, as seen in their college experiences and their desire to avoid mistakes. They also exhibit a sense of responsibility by being a supportive colleague and friend. While they admit to being competitive, they ultimately value hard work and learning.


These responses suggest a balanced personality with a moderate level of both extraversion and conscientiousness.
