Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "a little bit shy" and preferring to stay on the side of the room in social settings. However, they also mention trying to be more outgoing and sharing their experiences in group discussions. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual acknowledges past struggles with organization and attention to detail, but also demonstrates a desire to improve and a willingness to put in effort when faced with challenging tasks.  They express a clear preference for independent work and taking initiative, which aligns with conscientiousness.  


It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited sample of responses and should be treated as a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a broader range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
