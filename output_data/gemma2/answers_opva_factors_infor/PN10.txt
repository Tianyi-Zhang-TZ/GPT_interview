Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 2.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as an extrovert who enjoys social situations and leading discussions. They express a desire to connect with people and a preference for being around others. However, they also acknowledge a "nervous" side that emerges in unfamiliar social settings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, with a tendency towards social engagement but some internal conflict or discomfort in certain situations.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual expresses a desire to be organized and meticulous, their answers reveal a struggle with consistency. They admit to forgetting things, struggling with challenging tasks, and sometimes acting impulsively.  This inconsistency in behavior and self-reported conscientiousness suggests a lower rating.  


It's important to remember that these ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should not be considered a definitive personality assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a standardized personality test and a deeper understanding of the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
