Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as primarily introverted, feeling uncomfortable in social situations with strangers. They acknowledge having some extroverted tendencies when around close friends but generally prefer smaller, more familiar social settings.  Their answers in questions 1, 5, and 7 reveal a preference for quieter environments and a tendency to avoid taking the lead in social situations. However, they also demonstrate a willingness to step outside their comfort zone occasionally, particularly in work-related social events with colleagues. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently portrays themselves as highly organized, detail-oriented, and persistent. They emphasize their meticulous approach to tasks, their aversion to mistakes, and their commitment to seeing things through to completion. Their answers in questions 2, 4, 6, and 8 clearly illustrate these traits. They are driven by a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to excel, placing a high value on accuracy and efficiency. This pattern of responses strongly suggests a high level of conscientiousness.
