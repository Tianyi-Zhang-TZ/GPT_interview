Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mixed approach to social situations. While they express a desire for control and influence in social settings (e.g., taking over the dynamic in the work situation), they also seem to avoid large, unstructured social events (e.g., declining the launch party). Their enjoyment of working with others and their ability to raise team spirits suggest some extroverted tendencies, but their preference for controlled interactions and avoidance of large gatherings point towards a more introverted leaning.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and order,  demonstrate a strong work ethic (e.g., meticulous attention to detail, handling stressful situations calmly), and take responsibility for their actions and outcomes (e.g., taking ownership of website backups). Their frustration with others' lack of organization and their tendency to take charge in situations requiring attention to detail further support this rating.
