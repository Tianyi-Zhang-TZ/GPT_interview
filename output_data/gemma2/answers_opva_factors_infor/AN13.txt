Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally open to meeting new people but also acknowledges feeling insecure and less outgoing in unfamiliar social situations. They express enjoyment in structured social events and participating in discussions. While they don't explicitly describe themselves as highly energetic or assertive, their willingness to engage and contribute in social settings suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on order, organization, and attention to detail. They describe a strong desire to do things correctly, a tendency to get stressed when mistakes occur, and a willingness to go the extra mile to ensure accuracy. Their examples from work and personal life highlight their commitment to responsibility and thoroughness, placing them firmly in the higher range of conscientiousness.
