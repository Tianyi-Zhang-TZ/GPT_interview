Extraversion: 2 
Conscientiousness: 3

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort with social situations, preferring solitude and avoiding events like after-work gatherings. They describe themselves as a "Class Clown" using humor to cope with stress and awkwardness, suggesting a preference for internalized expression rather than outward social engagement. Their reluctance to participate in group discussions and discomfort with social events point towards lower extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual struggles with attention to detail and sometimes appears disorganized, they demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility and commitment. They take initiative to resolve problems, even impulsively, as seen in their example with the Discord server. Their desire to help others and alleviate their distress, even if through humor, suggests a caring and conscientious nature.
