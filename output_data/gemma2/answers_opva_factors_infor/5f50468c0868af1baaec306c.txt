Extraversion: 3 
Conscientiousness: 6 

**Explanation:**

* **Extraversion:** While the candidate demonstrates some willingness to engage socially (like attending the holiday party), their responses suggest a preference for smaller, more controlled social interactions. They acknowledge feeling shy and hesitant to participate in larger gatherings. Their desire to "show a little bit more of [their] personality outside of work" indicates a potential for increased extraversion with effort.

* **Conscientiousness:** The candidate consistently exhibits traits of high conscientiousness. They emphasize their attention to detail, meticulous planning, and dedication to accuracy in their work. They describe themselves as an "overachiever" who strives for excellence and completion of tasks correctly. Their efforts to create a winning Halloween display, despite it being a non-work-related activity, further demonstrate their strong work ethic and commitment to quality.
