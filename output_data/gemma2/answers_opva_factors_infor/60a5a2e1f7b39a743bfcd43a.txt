Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5 

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes enjoying social situations, feeling comfortable in groups, and often taking a leading role in conversations. They express a preference for socializing and interacting with others. Their answers suggest a high level of sociability and assertiveness.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates strong organizational skills and a tendency to be detail-oriented, there are hints of impulsiveness. Their willingness to "go after" what they want immediately, even if it requires sacrificing other goals, suggests a potential lack of long-term planning and self-discipline. However, their ability to save for a future goal indicates some level of conscientiousness.
