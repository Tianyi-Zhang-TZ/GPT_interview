Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as social, friendly, and enjoys being the center of attention in group discussions. They actively participate, lead conversations, and seek opportunities to connect with others. Their enjoyment of social events and their desire to get to know people further solidify this high rating. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a strong work ethic and attention to detail, they also acknowledge moments of impulsivity and a tendency to overthink. Their desire to be seen as competent and their occasional struggle to balance their drive with careful consideration suggest a score closer to the middle of the scale.
