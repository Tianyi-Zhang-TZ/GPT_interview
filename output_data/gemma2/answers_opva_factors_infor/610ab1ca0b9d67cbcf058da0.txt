Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a nuanced understanding of extraversion, acknowledging both introverted and extroverted tendencies. They appear comfortable in social situations when familiar with people but might feel more reserved in unfamiliar settings.  Their willingness to take a leadership role in a team meeting despite being new to the profession suggests a capacity for extraversion when needed.  However, instances of self-consciousness and shyness at social events indicate a moderate level of extraversion overall. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, detail-orientation, and thoroughness in their work.  Examples include meticulously returning materials, double-checking data entry, and demonstrating a strong work ethic even during challenging times. Their commitment to accuracy and preparedness points to a highly conscientious personality.
