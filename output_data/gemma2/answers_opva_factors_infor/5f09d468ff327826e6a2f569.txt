Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "outgoing" and comfortable initiating conversations in social situations. They also enjoy participating in group discussions and taking on a leadership role. However, they also value personal and professional separation and prefer socializing with friends rather than colleagues. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the sociable side but not excessively outgoing.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail. They prioritize finishing tasks properly, organizing their work, and planning ahead. They also show a commitment to teamwork and helping others, even when facing challenging situations. Their emphasis on thoroughness, planning, and following through on commitments points to a high level of conscientiousness.
