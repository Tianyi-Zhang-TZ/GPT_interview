Here's a breakdown of the personality factor ratings based on the provided answers:

**Extraversion: 3** 

* **Why:** The responses suggest a preference for smaller social settings and a tendency to be more introverted.  While the individual enjoys the company of close friends and can be enthusiastic in certain situations (like the Starlit Splash), they generally don't seek out large social gatherings or crave being the center of attention.

**Conscientiousness: 5**

* **Why:**  The answers consistently demonstrate a strong emphasis on responsibility, organization, and attention to detail.  Examples include:
    *  Choosing to take on the challenging 12- and 14-hour shifts at Disney even though they were difficult.
    *  The meticulous work ethic shown in the freelance visual effects editing job, spending hours ensuring every detail was perfect.
    *  The desire to consider the feelings of others and avoid causing discomfort, even when it means sacrificing personal gain.
