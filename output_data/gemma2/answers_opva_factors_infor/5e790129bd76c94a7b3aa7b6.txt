Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone, preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions, and expressing a preference for avoiding after-work social events. While they do tell jokes and try to be helpful, these instances seem more driven by a desire to alleviate tension or discomfort rather than a genuine enjoyment of social interaction.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong focus on detail and accuracy in their work, expressing frustration when tasks are challenging and a tendency to double-check and triple-check their work. They also describe a desire to complete tasks thoroughly and independently before seeking help. While they admit to sometimes feeling frustrated and exhausted by this meticulousness, it highlights their commitment to quality and careful execution.  


It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited sample of responses and should not be considered a definitive assessment of the individual's personality. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a broader range of questions and data points.
