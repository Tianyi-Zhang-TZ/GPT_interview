Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to initiate social interaction, even in unfamiliar settings (e.g., the pre-med Honor Society mixer). They also enjoy leading discussions and participating in group activities. While they initially hesitated to attend the Christmas party, they recognized the value of social connection and ultimately had a positive experience. These examples suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently prioritizes organization, cleanliness, and attention to detail. They meticulously clean up after work calls, adhere to a strict budget, and demonstrate a strong work ethic by taking initiative and responsibility in challenging situations. Their desire to be prepared and thorough in their work highlights a high level of conscientiousness.
