Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as bubbly, extroverted, and enjoying social interaction. They express a preference for leading in group discussions and thrive on excitement and social engagement. Their descriptions clearly point towards a high level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates ambition, a desire to complete tasks meticulously, and a tendency to be particular, they also acknowledge challenges with focus and impulsivity.  Their willingness to acknowledge these weaknesses suggests a level of self-awareness that might temper their conscientiousness score slightly.
