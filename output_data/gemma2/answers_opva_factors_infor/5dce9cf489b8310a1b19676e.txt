**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes feeling self-conscious in unfamiliar social settings, they also express a desire to engage with others and actively prompt participation in group discussions. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They value social connection but might require some comfort or familiarity to fully shine.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. They describe themselves as driven, focused, and dedicated to completing tasks accurately. They also take initiative to ensure tasks are completed even when others are struggling. This pattern strongly points to a high level of conscientiousness.
