Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of extraversion. While they acknowledge feeling reserved in new social situations and initially self-conscious in work-related social events, they also express enjoyment in social settings once comfortable, actively participate in discussions, and demonstrate a willingness to engage with others, even in challenging circumstances. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a high level of conscientiousness. They consistently emphasize their dedication to tasks, meticulousness with details, and commitment to following through on responsibilities.  Examples include their efforts to organize and return props, their careful attention to instructions during background acting, and their willingness to persevere through a challenging task (helping move the couch) despite initial reluctance.
