Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially feeling uncomfortable. They express a desire to connect with others and describe instances where they actively participated in group discussions and attempted to lift the spirits of their colleagues. However, they also acknowledge moments where they prefer to observe and let others take the lead, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently highlights their attention to detail, particularly in their previous role as a barista. They demonstrate a commitment to accuracy and efficiency, striving to complete tasks thoroughly and on time. They also express a willingness to push themselves when facing challenging situations, as exemplified by their efforts to succeed in a difficult class. These examples point towards a strong conscientiousness score.
