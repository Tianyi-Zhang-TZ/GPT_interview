Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a tendency towards social engagement and leadership in group settings (Questions 3, 5, 7). They describe adapting their behavior to fit social situations and enjoying social interactions, even when having a bad day. However, their initial nervousness in unfamiliar social situations (Question 1) suggests they are not completely comfortable with all social contexts.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their attention to detail, organization, and commitment to tasks (Questions 2, 4, 6, 8). They prioritize completing tasks meticulously and seek guidance from experienced individuals to ensure accuracy. Their preference for seeking information and relying on established procedures suggests a strong conscientiousness.
