Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 2.5 

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for social interaction and engagement, particularly in familiar settings. They express discomfort in unfamiliar social situations, but also show a willingness to take on leadership roles in group discussions. Their enjoyment of after-work social events and attempts to raise team spirits further support a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual mentions valuing organization and order, their responses often lack concrete examples of meticulous planning or attention to detail. They admit to not being a "handyman" and describe instances where they struggled with tasks requiring precision. Their tendency to act impulsively in pursuit of desired outcomes suggests a lower level of conscientiousness. 


It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be treated as a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a wider range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
