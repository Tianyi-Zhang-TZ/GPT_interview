**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even if initially feeling nervous. They actively seek to introduce themselves to people and enjoy social gatherings with their lab group. Their enjoyment of team sports and their leadership role in encouraging teammates suggest a comfortable level of extraversion. However, they don't appear to be overly outgoing or dominant.

They describe themselves as hard-working, detail-oriented, and committed to completing tasks thoroughly. Examples include their lab practices, studying for the DAT, and even their approach to proctoring exams. This pattern strongly suggests a high level of conscientiousness.
