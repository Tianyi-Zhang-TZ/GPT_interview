Extraversion: 4 
Conscientiousness: 6 

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual demonstrates some instances of pushing themselves outside their comfort zone socially (attending the after-work event), they primarily describe themselves as introverted and needing to exert effort to initiate social interactions.  Their preference for solitary activities like knitting and organizing also points towards a lower extraversion score. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize meticulousness, attention to detail,  hard work, and a strong sense of responsibility.  Examples include their dedication to understanding a new field before contributing, their commitment to finishing projects despite challenges, and their careful approach to potentially dangerous lab work.
