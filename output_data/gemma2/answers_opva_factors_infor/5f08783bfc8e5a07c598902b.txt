Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as typically gregarious but feeling uncomfortable and defensive in unfamiliar social situations. While they acknowledge their extroverted tendencies, their discomfort in new social settings suggests a lower level of extraversion. Their responses also indicate a preference for listening over leading in group discussions and a tendency to decline after-work social events.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. They express a desire to complete tasks thoroughly, prioritize accuracy, and carefully assess risks before acting.  Their willingness to go the extra mile to help a customer and their commitment to diligence in their work point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
