Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally introverted and preferring one-on-one interactions. However, they demonstrate a willingness to step outside their comfort zone in social situations and actively engage with others. They also value building relationships with colleagues and attending social events, albeit in a controlled manner. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their responsibility, attention to detail, and commitment to quality work. They readily admit to seeking help when needed and demonstrate a strong work ethic. Their actions during times of stress and their deliberate approach to achieving goals further solidify their high conscientiousness score.
