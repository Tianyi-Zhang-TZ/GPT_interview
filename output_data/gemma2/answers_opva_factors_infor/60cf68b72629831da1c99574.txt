Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual acknowledges being an introvert at heart and experiencing anxiety in social situations, they actively seek out social interaction and enjoy learning about people. They demonstrate a willingness to step outside their comfort zone and take on leadership roles in group discussions. Their desire to attend after-work events despite anxiety suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently emphasizes the importance of careful planning, attention to detail, and following procedures. They describe themselves as a "bulldog" who perseveres through challenging tasks and prioritizes completing work accurately. Their commitment to double-checking directions and their preference for thoughtful action over impulsivity strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
