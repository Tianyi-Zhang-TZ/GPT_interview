Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Why:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mix of comfort and discomfort in social situations. While they acknowledge enjoying social interaction, they also express nervousness in unfamiliar settings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.  Their willingness to listen in a group discussion rather than immediately taking a leading role further supports this.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays behaviors indicative of conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. Examples include their efforts to organize equipment, double-checking orders, and taking initiative to help their colleagues. Their willingness to put in extra effort even when tired also points towards high conscientiousness.
