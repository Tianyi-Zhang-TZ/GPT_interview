Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as an introvert and prefers solitude over large social gatherings. While they acknowledge the importance of being part of a team and attending work functions, they consistently express a preference for smaller, more intimate settings. They also describe themselves as comfortable taking on a leadership role in discussions when confident, but this doesn't necessarily indicate a strong preference for being the center of attention. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. They strive to leave things better than they found them and actively seek feedback to ensure accuracy. They also demonstrate a strong work ethic and a willingness to seek help when needed, rather than impulsively taking on challenges beyond their capabilities.
