Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as shy and uncomfortable in social situations with unfamiliar people. They prefer to listen rather than lead in group discussions and only attend after-work events if they know people there. While they are willing to help teammates, they don't seem to actively seek out social interaction or enjoy being the center of attention. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates strong conscientiousness through several examples. They prioritize completing tasks meticulously, even going the extra mile to ensure accuracy and efficiency. They take detailed notes, consider trade-offs carefully, and consult with their team before making decisions. They also show a strong sense of responsibility by ensuring they leave things in the correct state after use, even in a software-based work environment.
