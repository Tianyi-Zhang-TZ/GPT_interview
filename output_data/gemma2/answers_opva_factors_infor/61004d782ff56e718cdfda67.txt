Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual identifies as an introvert and acknowledges discomfort in unfamiliar social situations, they also express a willingness to push themselves outside their comfort zone for the sake of making connections and building relationships.  They recognize the importance of social interaction in the workplace and are willing to attend social events despite personal preference. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They describe themselves as a perfectionist, detail-oriented, and goal-oriented. They prioritize order and organization, are committed to completing tasks thoroughly, and actively seek solutions to overcome challenges.  Their willingness to help colleagues and take on additional responsibilities when needed further reinforces their conscientious nature.
