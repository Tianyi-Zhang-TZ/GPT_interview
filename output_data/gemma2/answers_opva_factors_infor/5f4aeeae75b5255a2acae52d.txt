Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for listening and observing in social situations, indicating a moderate level of extraversion. While they are comfortable being alone and value social connections, they don't actively seek out the spotlight or dominate conversations. Their willingness to engage in social events suggests a desire for social interaction, but it's not a defining characteristic.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently emphasizes organization, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. They prioritize completing tasks meticulously, seek solutions independently, and value planning and reflection. Their responses clearly highlight a high level of conscientiousness.
