Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes themselves as typically "warm and excited to talk," they also express feeling uncomfortable and lonely in unfamiliar social settings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, where they enjoy social interaction but may need time to warm up or feel more comfortable in certain situations.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, detail-orientation, and taking care of shared spaces. They also show a tendency to think things through carefully and act thoughtfully, even when faced with challenges or desires.
