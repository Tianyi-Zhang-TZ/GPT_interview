Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes enjoying social situations, even when initially feeling nervous. They actively seek out social events and leadership roles, indicating a preference for external stimulation and interaction. Their anecdote about the Hong Kong bar encounter further highlights their comfort in social settings and ability to connect with others.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a strong desire for order and organization, their tendency to seek help when facing challenging tasks suggests a potential lack of complete self-sufficiency. They acknowledge the importance of attention to detail but also admit to sometimes getting bogged down in minutiae. Their willingness to collaborate and seek guidance when needed indicates a level of conscientiousness that is high but not rigidly inflexible.
