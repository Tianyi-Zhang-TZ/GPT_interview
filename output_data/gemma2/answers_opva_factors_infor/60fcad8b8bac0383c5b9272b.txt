Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual acknowledges being introverted and prefers solitude, they demonstrate a capacity to adapt and engage in social situations when necessary. They describe actively taking on leadership roles in group discussions and using their "fake extroverted death" to boost team morale. This suggests a level of extraversion beyond their typical preference. However, their strong preference for alone time and avoidance of after-work social events indicate a leaning towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their dedication to detail, thoroughness, and commitment to excellence. They describe going the extra mile in their work, striving for perfection, and meticulously planning tasks. Their willingness to put in extra effort, even when facing challenges, and their focus on accuracy and precision strongly point towards high conscientiousness.
