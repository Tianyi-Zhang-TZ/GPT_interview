Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and loud with known people, but significantly more introverted in unfamiliar social settings. They also mention feeling socially pressured to attend events and sometimes needing to "psych themselves up" to go. While they enjoy socializing with close colleagues, these descriptions suggest a preference for smaller, more familiar social situations and a tendency towards introversion in new or larger groups.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of organization and responsibility. They prioritize keeping things tidy, completing tasks thoroughly, and paying meticulous attention to detail to avoid mistakes. They also express a dislike for failure and a tendency to overthink to ensure accuracy. While they admit to sometimes pushing themselves too hard and avoiding asking for help, their overall emphasis on organization, thoroughness, and a strong work ethic points towards a high conscientiousness score.
