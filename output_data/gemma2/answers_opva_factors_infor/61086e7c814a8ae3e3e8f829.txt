Their desire to lead and encourage their team members also suggests a preference for social engagement. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, order, and attention to detail. They describe themselves as a "finisher" who strives for excellence and completion.
