Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for solitude and discomfort in unfamiliar social situations. They express a tendency to avoid social interactions unless they feel comfortable and familiar with the people present. While they acknowledge a desire to engage in conversations, their anxiety and lack of social confidence suggest a lower level of extraversion. 
* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks efficiently.  Examples include their meticulous approach to silverware sorting, their dedication to research studies, and their ability to follow instructions carefully. Their decision to withdraw from the challenging online class, while seemingly impulsive, could also be interpreted as a conscientious effort to avoid potential failure and frustration.
