Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable and lost in social situations where they don't know anyone. While they express a desire to be a team player and raise spirits, their reluctance to attend after-work social events and the discomfort they feel in unfamiliar social settings suggest a preference for smaller, more intimate interactions. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail. They prioritize putting things back in place, double-checking their work, and preparing thoroughly for promotions. Their dedication to following instructions and avoiding mistakes points towards a highly conscientious personality.
