Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mix of outgoingness and shyness. While they describe themselves as "very outgoing and fun" and "charismatic," they also express nervousness in social situations, particularly when they don't know people. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. They seem comfortable taking on leadership roles in group discussions but also acknowledge a dislike for authority.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to do things correctly. They highlight their attention to detail in work tasks, their commitment to completing assignments thoroughly, and their desire to achieve goals.  Their careful approach to situations, even when under pressure, points towards a higher level of conscientiousness. 


It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be considered a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a wider range of questions and potentially standardized personality tests.
