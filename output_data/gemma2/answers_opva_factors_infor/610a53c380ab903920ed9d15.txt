Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and enjoys social settings with known people. However, they also acknowledge feeling more introverted and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the more introverted side. Their enjoyment of trivia and virtual happy hours indicates a preference for social interaction in a structured or less pressure-filled environment.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail. They describe themselves as organized, methodical, and dedicated to completing tasks accurately. Their examples from the internship and coding project highlight their commitment to thoroughness and their willingness to go the extra mile to avoid mistakes.  Their decision to prioritize work over personal desires also points towards a conscientious personality.
