Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and generally prefers solitary activities. They acknowledge feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and tend to be more of a listener than a leader in group discussions. However, they also express a willingness to step out of their comfort zone and engage when passionate about a topic, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, attention to detail, and a drive for completion. They describe feeling stressed and anxious when tasks are not organized and completed to their satisfaction. Their responses highlight a strong sense of responsibility and a tendency to push themselves to achieve high standards. The mentions of ADHD and OCD, while not directly correlating to conscientiousness,  indicate a tendency towards meticulousness and a strong internal drive for order.
