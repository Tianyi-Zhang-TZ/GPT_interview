Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of extraversion. While they acknowledge feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations initially, they actively seek to engage and make conversation. They also express enjoyment in social events like the work Christmas party, finding value in connecting with colleagues outside of work. However, their preference for group discussions without a designated leader suggests a level of comfort with both participation and observation, rather than solely seeking the spotlight.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits a high level of conscientiousness. They consistently describe themselves as detail-oriented, organized, and committed to completing tasks thoroughly.  Examples include their meticulous cleanup after a painting project, their thorough research for the plumbing issue, and their choice to prioritize customer service over impulsive anger.  Their actions demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility and a drive for accuracy and completion.
