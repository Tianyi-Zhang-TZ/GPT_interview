Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5 

**Here's why:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mixed pattern regarding social situations. While they express anxiety and discomfort in unfamiliar social settings, they also show a willingness to engage and find enjoyment in social interaction. Their enjoyment of group discussions and attempts to raise team spirits suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a generally conscientious approach to tasks and responsibilities. They describe themselves as someone who puts things back in place, prioritizes organization, and strives to complete challenging tasks. However, instances like the test-taking scenario and online shopping impulse reveal some potential for inconsistency in their conscientiousness. 


It's important to note that these are just initial impressions based on limited information. A comprehensive personality assessment would involve more in-depth questioning and analysis.
