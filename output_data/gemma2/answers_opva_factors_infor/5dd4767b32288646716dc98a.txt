Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even if initially uncomfortable. They show a desire to connect with colleagues and build relationships. Their example of attending the after-work social event despite tiredness highlights a preference for social interaction. However, they also acknowledge moments of discomfort in social settings, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion rather than being highly outgoing.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to tasks. They prioritize completing work diligently, even when facing challenges or distractions. Their examples of returning equipment, striving for excellence in a challenging project, and seeking to support a colleague demonstrate conscientiousness. While they admit to occasional struggles with focus, their overall actions point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
