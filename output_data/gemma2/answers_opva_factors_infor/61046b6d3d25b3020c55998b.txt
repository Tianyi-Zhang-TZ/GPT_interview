Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as comfortable in social situations, enjoys interacting with others, and seeks out opportunities for social connection. They also mention feeling a bit shy in group discussions, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates some conscientious traits, such as planning and attention to detail, there are instances where impulsivity and a lack of adherence to established procedures are mentioned. Their description of the equipment situation and the video shoot suggests a tendency to act without fully considering the proper channels, which somewhat lowers their conscientiousness score.
