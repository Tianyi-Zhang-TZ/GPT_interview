* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for smaller social settings and describes feeling more comfortable in familiar situations. While they are willing to participate in social events for professional reasons, they generally feel more at ease alone. They also express a preference for asking questions and gathering information rather than taking a leading role.  These responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion.
