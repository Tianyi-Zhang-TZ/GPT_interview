Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and talkative, but also acknowledges times when they felt shy and reserved in new social situations. Their willingness to lead in student council and participate in after-work social events, despite initial nervousness, suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates a pattern of becoming more organized and detail-oriented over time in work settings. They show a willingness to push themselves through challenging tasks, like running cross-country, even when initially feeling unmotivated. However, their tendency to prioritize work and studies over social events suggests a slightly lower level of conscientiousness compared to someone who consistently prioritizes organization and task completion.
