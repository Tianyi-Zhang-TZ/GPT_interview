Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally reserved and introverted, preferring to listen rather than lead in social situations. While they can step into leadership roles when necessary and value fostering relationships, their default tendency leans towards introversion.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, detail-orientation, and thoroughness in their work. They are also self-aware, recognizing their strengths and limitations, and actively seek to improve processes. Their approach to handling challenging situations and advocating for themselves also reflects a conscientious and measured personality.
