Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion. While the individual acknowledges feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings initially, they also demonstrate a willingness to participate in group discussions and analyze different viewpoints. Their description of attending a social event after work hints at a potential openness to social interaction, but it's not a strong indicator of high extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The responses consistently highlight the individual's organized and dedicated nature. They emphasize their meticulousness in organizing equipment, their commitment to completing tasks even when challenging, and their focus on detail-oriented work.  Their self-description as someone who doesn't "throw their work" and their dedication to learning about their company further support a high score in conscientiousness.
