Extraversion: 4 
Conscientiousness: 3 

**Explanation:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and enjoys being around people. They describe themselves as energetic and bubbly, and they often gravitate towards familiar faces at social events. However, they also express a tendency to avoid overwhelming others and sometimes struggle with initiating conversations with new people. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual expresses a desire to be thorough and committed to their tasks, they also admit to struggling with paying attention to detail and sometimes prioritizing the big picture over smaller details. They also acknowledge a tendency to overextend themselves and get tired easily, which could indicate a moderate level of conscientiousness.
