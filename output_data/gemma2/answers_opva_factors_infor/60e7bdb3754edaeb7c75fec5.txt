Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 2.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a clear preference for social interaction and engagement. They describe themselves as outgoing and enjoy initiating conversations. However, they also acknowledge instances where they felt uncomfortable in social settings and preferred to withdraw. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the outgoing side but with some sensitivity to social situations.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual expresses a desire to be organized and responsible, they also admit to struggles with tidiness and procrastination. They acknowledge the importance of attention to detail but mention anxiety and stress when faced with demanding tasks. This inconsistency between aspiration and action points to a lower level of conscientiousness.
