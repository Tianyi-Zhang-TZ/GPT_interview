Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0 

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even unfamiliar ones, and appears comfortable adapting to different social dynamics. They actively seek out learning opportunities in group settings and enjoy social events with colleagues. Their enjoyment of group discussions and after-work gatherings further supports this.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual acknowledges their ADHD, they demonstrate a strong capacity for attention to detail in specific tasks, highlighting a conscientious approach. They express a desire to complete tasks thoroughly and well, even if it means putting in extra effort. However, instances of impulsivity, such as taking longer breaks or leaving jobs abruptly, suggest a less structured approach to work and life in general. 


It's important to remember that these are estimations based on a limited sample of responses. A comprehensive personality assessment would involve a more extensive and standardized evaluation.
