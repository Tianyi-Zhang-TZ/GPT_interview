Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual expresses a clear preference for social interaction and enjoyment in company. They describe themselves as "social," "happy to meet new people," and "loving to have a lot of friends."  They also admit to being more comfortable listening than leading in group discussions, indicating a possible preference for less dominant social roles. However, their enthusiasm for after-work events and their willingness to approach their boss impulsively suggest a degree of extroverted assertiveness.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, detail-orientation, and completing tasks thoroughly. They express a desire to "do things very well" and a commitment to putting everything back in order. They also highlight their willingness to take on challenges and learn new things, even if they are initially unfamiliar. Their actions, like carefully checking their work for errors and offering support to teammates, further reinforce their conscientious nature.
