Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates a clear preference for solitude and describes themselves as introverted. However, they also acknowledge the ability to become more extroverted in familiar settings and when motivated. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, capable of adapting to social situations but generally comfortable with less social interaction. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits of high conscientiousness. They emphasize responsibility, organization, attention to detail, and self-control.  Examples like fixing the log splitter, prioritizing putting tools back, and resisting impulsive eating all point towards a strong sense of duty and commitment to completing tasks meticulously.
