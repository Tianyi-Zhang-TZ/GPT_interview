Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses a desire to make friends and be outgoing in social situations, they also describe themselves as shy and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings. Their tendency to "find someone they know" and their initial discomfort suggest a lower level of extraversion. However, their willingness to attend the after-work event and their talkativeness once comfortable with people indicate some degree of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, responsibility, dependability, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly.  Their emphasis on fairness and professionalism further supports this rating.
