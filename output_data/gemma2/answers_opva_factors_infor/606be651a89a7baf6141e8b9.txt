Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally quiet and preferring to observe in social situations where they don't know people. They also mention feeling more comfortable joining social events when they are feeling social and enjoy their co-workers. While they do participate in group discussions and offer opinions, they tend to be more reserved and thoughtful rather than outgoing and dominant. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on order, organization, and attention to detail. They express a desire to put things back in their place, avoid making mistakes, and carefully consider tasks before starting them. They also demonstrate a willingness to seek help when needed but prefer to handle things independently. Their actions and statements strongly suggest a high level of conscientiousness.
