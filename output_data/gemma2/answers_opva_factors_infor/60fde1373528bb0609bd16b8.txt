Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and prefers social settings with familiar people. They often assume a listening role in group discussions and don't readily jump into leading roles. While they wouldn't necessarily skip social events entirely, they indicate a preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and tidiness, strive for accuracy and attention to detail in their work, and are dedicated to completing tasks thoroughly. They also display a strong work ethic and a tendency to carefully consider decisions rather than acting impulsively.
