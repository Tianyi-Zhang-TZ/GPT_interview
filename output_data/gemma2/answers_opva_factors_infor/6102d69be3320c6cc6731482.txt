Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as initially withdrawn in social situations but able to warm up and engage once comfortable. They enjoy conversations and socializing with familiar people. However, their preference for listening in group discussions and their hesitation to attend social events with unfamiliar people suggest a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. They prioritize completing tasks meticulously, seek help when needed, and strive for accuracy and efficiency. Their dedication to maintaining a calm and organized work environment further supports a high score on conscientiousness.
