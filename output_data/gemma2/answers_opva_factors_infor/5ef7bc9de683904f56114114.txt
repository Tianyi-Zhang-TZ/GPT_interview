Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and comfortable in social situations, even when they don't know everyone. They enjoy leading discussions, making conversation, and participating in after-work events. However, they also mention not being "overly social" and preferring to have a few close friends rather than a large circle. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, planning, and attention to detail. They strive for accuracy in their work, take pride in completing tasks, and seek to avoid mistakes. They also value efficiency and helping others by ensuring things are done correctly.
