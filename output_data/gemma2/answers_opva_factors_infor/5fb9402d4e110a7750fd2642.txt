Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0 

**Why:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently demonstrates a preference for social interaction and engagement. They describe themselves as extroverted, enjoy meeting new people, and actively seek out social connections. While they acknowledge feeling a bit shy in unfamiliar situations, this appears to be a situational response rather than a core personality trait. Their willingness to initiate conversations and participate in group discussions further supports a higher extraversion score.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual generally displays traits associated with conscientiousness, such as a desire for order, attention to detail, and a commitment to completing tasks. However, they also express moments of anxiety and struggle when faced with unfamiliar or challenging situations, particularly regarding technology. This suggests that while they strive for organization and accuracy, they may not always be perfectly consistent in their conscientious behavior.
