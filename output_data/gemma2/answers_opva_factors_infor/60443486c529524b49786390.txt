Extraversion: 6 
Conscientiousness: 7

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear shift from introversion to extroversion over time. They enjoy social events, find comfort in interacting with colleagues, and actively participate in group activities.  Their willingness to lead tours and presentations in school further supports this. 
* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits of conscientiousness. They are detail-oriented, strive for accuracy, take pride in their work, and are focused on completing tasks thoroughly. Their examples of meticulous counting at work and their initiative to organize a holiday party for their team highlight their conscientious nature.
