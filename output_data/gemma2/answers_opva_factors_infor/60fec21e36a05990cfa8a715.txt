Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even though they initially experienced anxiety. They value being part of a team and enjoy social interactions with colleagues.  However, they also describe themselves as more of a listener in group discussions, suggesting they might not always be the most outgoing or dominant personality in social settings.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes organization, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. They strive for accuracy and completion, seek information before tackling challenges, and demonstrate a desire for continuous learning and improvement. These traits align strongly with a high conscientiousness score.
