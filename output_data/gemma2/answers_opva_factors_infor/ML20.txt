Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0 

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently demonstrates a desire for social interaction and engagement. They describe themselves as talkative, interested in others' lives, and comfortable taking on leadership roles in discussions (when they feel confident). While they acknowledge a preference for listening in unfamiliar situations, they generally express a willingness to step outside their comfort zone and connect with people.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual exhibits a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to their tasks. They prioritize order and organization, as evidenced by their meticulous approach to lab work. They also demonstrate a willingness to persevere through challenges and seek help when needed. However, there are instances where their attention to detail falters when explicitly reminded ("paying attention to details" triggers anxiety), suggesting a potential area for improvement in self-regulation.
