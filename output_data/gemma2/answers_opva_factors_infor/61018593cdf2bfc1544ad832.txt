Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as generally shy and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations. While they try to be friendly and make an effort to connect with others, they often feel reserved and prefer to observe rather than take the lead.  There are instances where they step up to lead or comfort others, but these seem more situational than a consistent trait.  

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits of high conscientiousness. They value organization, order, and attention to detail. They describe themselves as a perfectionist and someone who strives to complete tasks thoroughly and accurately. They also exhibit a strong work ethic, willing to put in extra effort to meet deadlines and achieve goals.
