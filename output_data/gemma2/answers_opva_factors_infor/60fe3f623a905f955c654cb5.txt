Extraversion: 6 
Conscientiousness: 7

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and enjoys being around people. They describe feeling energized by their friends and colleagues, actively seeking out social events even when tired.  They also show comfort in leading and sharing their knowledge in a panel setting. However, there are moments where they acknowledge internalizing feelings and becoming quieter when focused on a task, suggesting a balance rather than a strong extroverted preference.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays a strong emphasis on organization, planning, and attention to detail. They describe feeling stressed when details are involved but striving for perfection in their work. They also prioritize meeting deadlines and completing tasks meticulously. Their desire to create a positive work environment for their staff and their meticulous planning for holidays show a high level of conscientiousness.
