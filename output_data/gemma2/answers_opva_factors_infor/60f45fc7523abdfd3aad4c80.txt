Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual frequently mentions enjoying social interactions, meeting new people, and taking a leading role in discussions. They express comfort in social settings and seem to thrive in collaborative environments. While they acknowledge being a "social person," there's no indication of extreme extroversion, suggesting a preference for social engagement rather than a constant need for it.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong work ethic and a commitment to accuracy and detail. They describe instances where they meticulously pay attention to details to avoid errors and actively seek solutions to problems. However, there are instances where they express frustration with setbacks and feeling a sense of responsibility when things don't go as planned. This suggests a conscientious individual who strives for excellence but can experience emotional impact from challenges.
