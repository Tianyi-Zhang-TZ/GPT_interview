Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for smaller, more intimate social settings and takes time to warm up to new people. They enjoy humor as a social tool and are comfortable leading conversations when necessary, but they don't seem to actively seek out or dominate social situations. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits of organization, responsibility, and attention to detail. They prioritize efficiency and cleanliness in their work environment, are goal-oriented, and carefully double-check tasks, especially those with significant consequences. Their thoughtful approach to purchases and reluctance to make impulsive decisions further indicate high conscientiousness.
