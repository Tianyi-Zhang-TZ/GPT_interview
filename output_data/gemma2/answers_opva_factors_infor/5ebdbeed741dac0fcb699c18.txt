Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as reserved and uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know people. They prefer to listen rather than lead in discussions and generally avoid after-work social events. While they enjoy socializing and getting to know people, these instances seem less frequent and driven by a desire for connection rather than a strong preference for social interaction.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of high conscientiousness. They prioritize finishing tasks, meticulously pay attention to detail, and strive for organization and order. They dislike leaving things unfinished and prefer to plan carefully before acting, demonstrating a thoughtful and responsible approach. Their desire to maintain a clean and organized workspace and their efforts to ensure everyone contributes in group projects further solidify this rating.
