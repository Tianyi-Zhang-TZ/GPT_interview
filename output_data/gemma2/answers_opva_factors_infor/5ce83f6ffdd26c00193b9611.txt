They enjoy after-work social events and find comfort in casual interactions with colleagues. However, they don't describe themselves as the "life of the party" or someone who actively seeks out social attention. This suggests a moderate level of Extraversion.

They strive to complete tasks thoroughly, seek help when needed, and prioritize accuracy. They value organization and planning, even in challenging situations.
