Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as comfortable in social situations, taking charge, and enjoying interactions with strangers. They express confidence in group discussions and actively participate, indicating a high level of extraversion.  

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a willingness to learn and improve (like taking website design classes), their responses sometimes lack a strong emphasis on organization, planning, and attention to detail.  They mention enjoying social events and unwinding, which could suggest a slightly lower level of conscientiousness compared to someone who prioritizes structured routines and meticulous work.
