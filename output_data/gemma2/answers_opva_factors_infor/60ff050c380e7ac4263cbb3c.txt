* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and friendly, enjoying meeting new people. However, they also acknowledge feeling uncomfortable in situations where they don't know anyone well, particularly when interacting with older peers. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, comfortable in familiar social settings but potentially less assertive in unfamiliar ones.

They prioritize responsibility,  avoid impulsive decisions, and strive for accuracy.  Their emphasis on following rules and working diligently points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
