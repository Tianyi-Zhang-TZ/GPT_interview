Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for social interaction and expressing themselves, as seen in their comfort in public settings (despite occasional guardedness) and their willingness to contribute in group discussions. They also mention enjoying social events with colleagues, though they choose to abstain due to personal preference rather than shyness.  Their tendency to be a "strong presenter" and "set an example" suggests a desire to be noticed and influential in social situations.
* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits of organization, responsibility, and a drive for accuracy. They highlight their meticulousness in work tasks, their dedication to keeping things tidy, and their willingness to push themselves beyond comfort zones to complete challenging tasks. Their preference for handling Spanish-speaking calls despite their limited fluency, and their focus on delivering a perfect landscaping job, further illustrate their conscientious nature.
