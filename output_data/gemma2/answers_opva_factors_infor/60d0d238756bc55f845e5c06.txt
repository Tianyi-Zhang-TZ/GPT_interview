Extraversion: 3 
Conscientiousness: 4 

**Explanation:**

* **Extraversion:** While the candidate initially describes themselves as a "life of the party" type, their response to Question 5 clearly shows a shift towards introversion after becoming a father. They prioritize rest and family time over social events. Their response to Question 7 also highlights a struggle with motivating others in a difficult situation, suggesting they might not be the most outwardly expressive or energetic leader.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The candidate consistently demonstrates high conscientiousness throughout their responses. They emphasize attention to detail when assembling their child's crib (Question 6),  take responsibility for managing their team's morale (Question 7), and acknowledge their lapse in judgment when prioritizing a personal goal over established rules (Question 8). Their willingness to learn and adapt, as seen in Question 8, further strengthens their conscientiousness.
