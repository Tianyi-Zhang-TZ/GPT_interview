Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Why:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially feeling uncomfortable. They actively seek opportunities to connect with others, initiate conversations, and contribute to group discussions. Their enjoyment of social events and their comfort in leading discussions suggest a higher level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual displays a strong work ethic and a desire to complete tasks thoroughly, there are instances where impulsivity and a lack of restraint are evident. Their tendency to indulge in excessive treats and their initial eagerness to make personal drinks at work suggest a moderate level of conscientiousness.
