Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. While they express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings initially, they also show a willingness to engage and initiate conversations in situations where they know people. Their preference for familiar social contexts and occasional "clamming up" suggest a leaning towards introversion, but their efforts to connect and be social in work settings indicate some extroverted traits.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, efficiency, and a strong sense of responsibility. They prioritize putting things back in place, meticulously approach tasks to avoid mistakes, and value planning and structure. Their aversion to change and preference for maintaining a stable routine further reinforce their conscientious nature.
