Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual describes themselves as generally shy and nervous in social situations, preferring to observe and listen rather than take the lead. While they can be assertive when they feel knowledgeable and confident, they don't appear to actively seek out social interaction or enjoy being the center of attention. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on organization, planning, and attention to detail. They express a deep aversion to mistakes and a commitment to thoroughness in their work. Examples include their meticulous approach to equipment organization, their proactive planning to avoid potential issues during a shoot, and their careful consideration before making a purchase. These traits point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
