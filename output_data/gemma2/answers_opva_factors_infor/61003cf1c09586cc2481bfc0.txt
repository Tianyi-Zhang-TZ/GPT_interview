* **Extraversion:**  While the individual expresses nervousness in social situations and identifies as an introvert, they also demonstrate a willingness to step outside their comfort zone and engage in group discussions. They admit to becoming more extroverted when put in a situation where everyone else is feeling the same way. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, capable of adapting to social contexts.
