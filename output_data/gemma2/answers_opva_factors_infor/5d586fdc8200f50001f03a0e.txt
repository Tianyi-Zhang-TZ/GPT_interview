Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual expresses discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and describes themselves as not a "social man." They also indicate a preference for avoiding social events. While they mention taking a leadership role in a project, this doesn't necessarily outweigh their overall aversion to social interaction. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility in completing tasks and putting things back in order. They describe themselves as someone who enjoys challenging tasks and puts in effort to avoid mistakes. They also show concern for others and try to raise their spirits during difficult times.  


**Important Note:** This rating is based on a limited sample of responses and should not be taken as a definitive personality assessment. A comprehensive evaluation would require a more extensive and standardized assessment tool.
