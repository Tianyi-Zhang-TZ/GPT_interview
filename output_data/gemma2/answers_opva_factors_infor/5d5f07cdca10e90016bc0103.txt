Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for smaller social settings and appears somewhat shy in unfamiliar situations. However, they actively participate in leading team meetings and value networking opportunities, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion. Their willingness to reschedule a dinner date with their wife to attend a work social event also points towards a moderate preference for social interaction.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits high levels of organization, attention to detail, and a strong sense of responsibility. They meticulously organize their workspace, prioritize completing tasks, and demonstrate a commitment to accuracy in their work. They also show empathy and understanding towards colleagues facing difficulties, but remain focused on providing practical support rather than solely emotional comfort. Their decision to share the work stipend amongst their team members rather than using it for personal gain further highlights their conscientious nature.
