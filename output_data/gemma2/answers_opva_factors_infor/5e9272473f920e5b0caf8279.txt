Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual mentions enjoying meeting new people, there's a clear preference for listening over leading in group discussions and a reluctance to attend work social events. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail. They prioritize orderliness (putting the Jet Bridge connector away), diligently complete tasks (data entry job), and strive for accuracy (rebooking passengers). Their willingness to go the extra mile and handle challenging situations (rebooking passengers) further points to a high level of conscientiousness.
