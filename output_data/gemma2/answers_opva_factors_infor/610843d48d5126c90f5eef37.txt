Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5 

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. While they express social anxiety in unfamiliar situations and acknowledge needing to "turn on" their extroverted personality, they also show confidence in leading discussions and raising team spirits. Their preference for declining a social event with a team they find abrasive suggests a cautious approach to social interactions. Overall, their responses point towards a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently exhibits traits associated with high conscientiousness. They value organization, attention to detail, and following procedures. Their descriptions of their work ethic, adherence to systems, and preference for structured tasks clearly indicate a strong sense of responsibility and self-discipline. Their willingness to accept help when needed also demonstrates a level of self-awareness and flexibility, which can be seen as a positive aspect of conscientiousness.
