Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual expresses a tendency towards shyness and discomfort in unfamiliar social situations (Question 1). While they acknowledge taking on leadership roles in discussions (Question 3), their general inclination seems to be towards observing rather than actively engaging socially (Question 5, Question 7). This suggests a moderate level of Extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong preference for planning and organization (Question 2), highlighting their conscientious nature. They also express a tendency to focus on details and strive for accuracy (Question 6) and demonstrate self-control by resisting impulsive actions (Question 8). These responses indicate a higher level of Conscientiousness. 


It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be viewed as a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would require a larger sample of questions and potentially standardized personality assessments.
