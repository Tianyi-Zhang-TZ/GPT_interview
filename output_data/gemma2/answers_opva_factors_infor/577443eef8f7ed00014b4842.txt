Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses enjoyment in social situations and demonstrates comfort interacting with new people. They actively participate in group discussions and show a willingness to lead. Their preference for family over a social event also suggests a balanced approach to social engagement rather than a strong preference for solitude.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual repeatedly emphasizes their meticulousness, organization, and dedication to completing tasks thoroughly. They prioritize accuracy and attention to detail, even under pressure. Their strategic approach to requesting a raise and their willingness to go the extra mile to ensure projects are finished on time further support a high score in conscientiousness.
