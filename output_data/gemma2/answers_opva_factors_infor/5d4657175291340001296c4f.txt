Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses a strong preference for social interaction, actively seeks out new connections, and enjoys leading discussions. Their answers demonstrate enthusiasm for engaging with others and building relationships. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual values cooperation and thoughtful decision-making, their answers occasionally reveal a tendency towards impulsivity and a lack of strict adherence to order or routine. They acknowledge past struggles with detail-oriented tasks and admit to sometimes jumping into projects without careful planning. This suggests a level of conscientiousness that is present but not always consistently applied.
