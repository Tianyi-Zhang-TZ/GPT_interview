Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as socially anxious and hesitant to put themselves out there in new social situations. While they acknowledge making progress in overcoming this anxiety, their initial discomfort and preference for smaller groups suggest a score closer to the lower end of the Extraversion spectrum. However, their willingness to participate in discussions and their desire to make new friends indicate a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize orderliness, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. Their examples of putting equipment back in place, carefully following instructions, and striving for accuracy highlight their strong sense of responsibility and organization. Their preference for independent work and reluctance to ask for help also point towards a conscientious nature.
