Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual demonstrates a preference for smaller social settings and admits to feeling nervous initiating conversations with new people. While they enjoy casual social events with familiar colleagues, they don't seem to actively seek out large or unfamiliar social situations. Their tendency to listen more than lead in discussions also points towards a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They emphasize organization and planning, take initiative in ensuring tasks are completed properly, and demonstrate a strong work ethic. They also show a willingness to take on additional responsibility and carefully follow instructions to avoid mistakes. Their desire to learn and improve through hands-on experience further supports this rating.
