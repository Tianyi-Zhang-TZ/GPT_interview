Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently demonstrates a preference for social interaction and engagement. They express comfort in new social situations, enjoy leading discussions, and actively seek out social events with colleagues. Their language reflects enthusiasm for connecting with others and a natural inclination towards outgoing behavior.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual displays a strong work ethic and attention to detail, there are instances where impulsivity or a lack of meticulous planning are hinted at. For example, they mention relying on intuition and post-it notes to manage tasks, suggesting a degree of organization but not necessarily a highly structured approach. Overall, their conscientiousness leans towards the higher end of the spectrum, but not as consistently high as their extraversion.
