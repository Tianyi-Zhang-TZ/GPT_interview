Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as shy initially in social situations and needing time to warm up. While they express being outgoing once comfortable and even giving a motivational speech, the initial discomfort and preference for smaller, familiar groups suggest a lower score on Extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of high conscientiousness. They emphasize following instructions, putting things back in their place, paying attention to detail, being reliable (showing up even with pain), and acting ethically (refusing to steal tips). Their desire to help teammates and treat others well also aligns with conscientiousness.
