Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally introverted and sometimes uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations. However, they also demonstrate a willingness to engage in conversations and ask questions, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion. Their enjoyment of socializing, particularly in smaller groups and with a purpose (like church discussions), further supports this rating.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their attention to detail, organization, and desire for perfection. They describe themselves as a "type A personality" and take pride in completing tasks thoroughly and accurately. Their willingness to put in extra effort to learn a difficult guitar piece and carefully assemble a stroller, even when it was not strictly necessary, strongly indicate high conscientiousness.
