Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for social interaction but also acknowledges a need to warm up to new people. They describe themselves as friendly and open once comfortable, enjoy work social events, and are empathetic and supportive of colleagues' emotions. However, they don't explicitly express a strong need for constant social stimulation or dominance in group discussions. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their dedication to work, attention to detail, thoroughness, and desire to complete tasks meticulously. They value organization, planning, and following through on commitments. They also demonstrate self-awareness by recognizing their strengths and seeking support when facing challenging tasks.
