Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a moderate level of extraversion. While they acknowledge feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations initially, they quickly adapt and seem comfortable engaging with others. They also express a willingness to participate in group discussions and social events, but not always enthusiastically. Their decision to skip the Halloween party suggests a preference for less stimulating social settings.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual displays a high level of conscientiousness. They consistently describe themselves as detail-oriented, organized, and responsible. They prioritize accuracy and completion of tasks, even under pressure. Their willingness to go the extra mile to ensure accuracy in their work and their efforts to raise their team's spirits demonstrate a strong sense of duty and consideration for others.
