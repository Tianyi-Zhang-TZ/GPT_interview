Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "outgoing" and "talkative," comfortable initiating conversations and participating in social settings. They also express a willingness to lead in group discussions and  value both leading and listening. However, they also acknowledge that they don't feel obligated to attend every social event and prefer to gauge compatibility before fully committing. This suggests a balanced approach to extraversion, leaning towards sociability but with some preference for selective engagement.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to tasks. They dislike leaving things unfinished, actively seek help when needed, and prioritize accuracy and attention to detail. They also express a willingness to ask for clarification and feedback to ensure they are handling situations appropriately. This pattern strongly indicates a high level of conscientiousness.
