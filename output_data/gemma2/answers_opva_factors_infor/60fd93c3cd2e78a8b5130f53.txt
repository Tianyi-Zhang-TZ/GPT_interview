Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses enjoyment in social situations, meeting new people, and engaging in conversations. They describe feeling comfortable and confident in social settings, even unfamiliar ones. Their answers to questions 1, 3, 5, and 7 all point towards a preference for social interaction and a comfortable demeanor in social contexts.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates some conscientious traits, such as valuing cleanliness and organization (Question 2), their answers to questions about handling challenges (Question 4) and impulse control (Question 8) suggest a slightly less rigid approach. They are willing to take on challenging tasks and occasionally act impulsively when driven by strong motivation.
