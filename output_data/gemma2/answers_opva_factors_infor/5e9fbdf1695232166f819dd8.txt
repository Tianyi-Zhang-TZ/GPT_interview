Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and friendly, comfortable in social situations. However, they also acknowledge instances where they felt more reserved, suggesting a level of adaptability rather than consistently high extraversion. Their willingness to step into a leadership role in a project and push themselves out of their comfort zone at a social event point towards a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize responsibility, reliability, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. Examples include their meticulous approach to data entry, willingness to take on challenging tasks, and decision to turn in found money rather than keeping it.  Their emphasis on being trustworthy and completing tasks accurately further solidify this rating.
