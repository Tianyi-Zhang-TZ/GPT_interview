Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as somewhat shy and preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions. They also tend to avoid after-work social events, indicating a preference for smaller social interactions or solitude. However, they do mention trying to connect with people at their new job and finding ways to make social situations more comfortable over time. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization and order, as seen in their meticulous approach to tool storage at their old job. They also value attention to detail, which was crucial in their military experience. Furthermore, they demonstrate self-discipline by waiting for the appropriate time to request a promotion and by focusing on their strengths rather than getting overwhelmed by challenging tasks. Their desire to improve and their proactive approach to problem-solving further support a high rating in conscientiousness.
