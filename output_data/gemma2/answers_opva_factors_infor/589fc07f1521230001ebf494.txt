Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and initially feeling uncomfortable in social situations. While they eventually engage and enjoy themselves, their preference for smaller groups and deliberate social interaction suggests a leaning towards lower extraversion.  However, they demonstrate the ability to be more outgoing and jovial in specific situations, like celebrating a team success, hinting at a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, take ownership of tasks, are detail-oriented, and strive for excellence. They are also described as persistent, determined, and focused, even when facing challenges. Their actions and self-descriptions strongly align with a high conscientiousness score.
