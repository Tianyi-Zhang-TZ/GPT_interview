Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling shy and hesitant in new social situations, particularly when they don't know anyone. They also mention feeling timid and holding back in a meeting where they were unfamiliar with the subject matter. However, they also express a desire to contribute in meetings and have a history of attending social events for colleagues. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of organization, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic. They prioritize putting things back in their place, meticulously complete tasks, and strive for accuracy. They also exhibit persistence and a willingness to take on challenging projects, even when feeling nervous.  These traits strongly point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
