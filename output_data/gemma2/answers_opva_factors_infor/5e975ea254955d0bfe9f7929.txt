Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally outgoing and comfortable in social settings, particularly when interacting with new people. They enjoy listening and facilitating conversations, and seem to find enjoyment in social events, especially those with a family-oriented or non-intoxicating atmosphere. However, they also acknowledge a preference for listening over leading and express a dislike for overly intoxicated social environments. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of high conscientiousness. They emphasize their responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. They describe themselves as a meticulous person who follows instructions carefully and strives for accuracy in their work. They also express a strong work ethic, a willingness to push through challenges, and a commitment to completing tasks thoroughly. Their aversion to impulsivity and preference for careful consideration in decision-making further solidify their high conscientiousness score.
