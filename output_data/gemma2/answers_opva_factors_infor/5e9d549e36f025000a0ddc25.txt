Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses enjoyment in social settings and feels comfortable leading in discussions, they also demonstrate a preference for solitude and separation between work and personal life. They often skip after-work events and describe themselves as "not very interesting" in social contexts outside of work. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays responsible and reliable behavior. They prioritize putting things back in place, strive to complete challenging tasks, and take pride in their work. They also demonstrate attentiveness to detail and a desire to avoid mistakes. These traits point towards a higher level of conscientiousness.
