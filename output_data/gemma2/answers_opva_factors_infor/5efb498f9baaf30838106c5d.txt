Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling shy and hesitant in unfamiliar social settings, particularly in a college environment. While they express openness and a willingness to share feelings generally, these instances suggest a degree of social anxiety and a preference for familiar social contexts.  Their responses in questions 3, 5, and 7 also indicate a tendency towards listening and observing rather than actively leading or initiating social interactions.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on organization, order, and attention to detail. They express enjoyment in cleaning and organizing their workspace and highlight their dedication to accuracy and thoroughness in tasks requiring precision. Their responses in questions 2, 4, 6, and 8 reveal a conscientious approach to work and a tendency to plan and execute tasks methodically.

**Overall:** While the individual displays some traits associated with extraversion, their responses suggest a preference for controlled social interactions and a comfort in familiar settings. Their conscientiousness, however, is evident in their organizational skills, attention to detail, and methodical approach to tasks.
