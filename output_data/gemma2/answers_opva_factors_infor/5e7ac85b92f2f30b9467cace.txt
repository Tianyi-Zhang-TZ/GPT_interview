Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally comfortable in social settings and enjoys spending time with friends. They are willing to participate in discussions but often prefer to listen and absorb others' ideas. While they are open to social events, they are selective and prioritize spending time with close friends over larger, school-organized gatherings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to tasks. They describe themselves as meticulous and detail-oriented, particularly in activities like playing chess where precision is crucial. They also express a preference for thoroughness and understanding over shortcuts, even when faced with challenging concepts. Their aversion to cheating and willingness to put in the effort to learn demonstrate high conscientiousness.
