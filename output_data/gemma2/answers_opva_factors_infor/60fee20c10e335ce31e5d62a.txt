Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. While they acknowledge feeling more introverted and preferring solo activities at times, they also actively seek social connections and demonstrate a willingness to step outside their comfort zone to build relationships.  Their participation in the after-work social event and efforts to raise team spirits during a stressful period indicate a desire for social engagement and a capacity to connect with others.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks meticulously. Their emphasis on being "particular," "organized," and "determined" suggests a strong work ethic and commitment to excellence. Examples like their meticulous work as a writer and their perseverance in the running class further solidify this assessment.
