Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 2.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual displays a tendency towards social engagement and expressiveness. They describe themselves as "confident and very funny" in social settings and often find themselves sharing their thoughts in group discussions. While they mention feeling some anxiety about social events, their desire to contribute and their self-assured demeanor suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual demonstrates some conscientiousness but also exhibits areas of inconsistency. They express a clear preference for organization and completing tasks, even when challenging. However, they also admit to struggling with attention to detail and sometimes needing multiple attempts to get things right. Their tendency to act impulsively, as evidenced in the work scenario, further suggests a lower level of conscientiousness. 


It's important to note that these ratings are based on a limited set of responses and should be considered a preliminary assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation would involve a wider range of questions and potentially standardized personality assessments.
