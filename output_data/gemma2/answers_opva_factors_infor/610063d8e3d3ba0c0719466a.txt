Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** Tom's responses suggest a preference for smaller social circles and a tendency to observe rather than lead in group discussions. While he doesn't explicitly state discomfort with social situations, his language indicates a preference for familiarity and a cautious approach to new interactions. This leans towards a lower score on Extraversion. However, his attempts to lighten the mood and entertain colleagues in work settings suggest some extraverted tendencies, preventing a score closer to 1. 

* **Conscientiousness:** Tom demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to perform well. He expresses frustration with mistakes and a drive to exceed expectations. His willingness to persevere through challenges like the milkshake machine and his attention to detail in his previous job point towards high conscientiousness.  His impulsiveness in taking the magazines suggests a slight deviation from strict conscientiousness, but overall, his responses indicate a strong commitment to duty and accuracy.
