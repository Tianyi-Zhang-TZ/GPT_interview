Extraversion: 2.0 
Conscientiousness: 2.5

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations, preferring solitude and small groups. They describe feeling "left out" and "dejected" at parties and often make excuses to avoid work social events. These responses indicate a preference for introversion rather than extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual acknowledges a tendency towards laziness and disorganization, they also demonstrate some conscientious traits. They describe taking on challenging tasks and pushing themselves to complete them, even when it's difficult. They also mention rewarding themselves for achieving goals, suggesting a degree of self-discipline.  However, their tendency to skip details and daydream more than working points towards lower conscientiousness overall.
