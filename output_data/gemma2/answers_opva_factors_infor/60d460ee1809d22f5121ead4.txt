Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling uncomfortable in new social situations and prefers listening over leading in discussions. They do, however, participate in after-work social events and enjoy socializing with colleagues. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and follows rules. They prioritize accuracy and attention to detail in their work, and actively try to step outside their comfort zone to take on new challenges. Their desire to help colleagues and make them feel better also points towards a conscientious nature.
