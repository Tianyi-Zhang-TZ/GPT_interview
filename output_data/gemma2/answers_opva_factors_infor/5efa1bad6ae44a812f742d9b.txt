Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as talkative, enjoying social situations, and comfortable taking on leadership roles. They express a preference for being around people and  describe themselves as "elated" and "high-spirited" in social contexts. These traits align strongly with extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a desire to be organized and efficient, they also express feelings of anxiety and haste. They describe themselves as "driven" and "motivated" but also "anxious" and "impulsive."  This suggests a level of conscientiousness, but also a tendency towards impulsivity that might detract from a higher score.
