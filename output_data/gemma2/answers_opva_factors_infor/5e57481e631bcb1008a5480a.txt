Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction in certain contexts (e.g., group discussions, after-work events) where they feel comfortable expressing their opinions and engaging with others. However, they also express discomfort and timidity in unfamiliar social situations, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their attention to detail, organization, and follow-through on tasks. They describe themselves as determined, careful, and focused, even when facing challenging situations. Their actions demonstrate a strong commitment to completing tasks thoroughly and responsibly.
