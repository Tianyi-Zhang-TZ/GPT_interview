Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual expresses some anxiety in new social situations, they also demonstrate a willingness to put themselves out there, take on leading roles in discussions, and actively engage in social events. Their desire to be successful in their work and their efforts to encourage others suggest a level of extraversion beyond simple shyness. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their attention to detail, perfectionism, and strong work ethic. They express a reluctance to admit failure and a drive to complete tasks meticulously. Their willingness to double-check work, seek guidance, and strive for accuracy all point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
