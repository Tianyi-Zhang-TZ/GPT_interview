While they can become more extroverted once they know people, their initial reactions and preferences point towards lower extraversion. 
* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates strong conscientiousness through their emphasis on organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. They express frustration with carelessness and value structure and order. Their desire to see projects through to completion and willingness to seek help when facing challenges further support a high conscientiousness score.
