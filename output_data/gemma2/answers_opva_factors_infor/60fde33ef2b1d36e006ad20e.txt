Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a clear preference for social interaction and engagement. They express comfort in meeting new people, enjoy connecting with colleagues, and actively participate in social events. While they acknowledge initial shyness, their efforts to overcome it and their enjoyment of social situations point towards a higher extraversion score.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits of organization, responsibility, and a strong work ethic. They prioritize tidiness, take pride in their work, and demonstrate a commitment to accuracy and attention to detail. Their willingness to take on challenging tasks, seek help when needed, and strive for excellence further support a high conscientiousness rating.
