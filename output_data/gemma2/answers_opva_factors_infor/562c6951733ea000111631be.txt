Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a preference for social situations, but with some reservations. While they enjoy being in a role where they can help and organize (as seen in their descriptions of work), they also express a clear need for personal space and boundaries. They decline after-work social events and prefer to keep their personal and professional lives separate. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They are meticulous, organized, and detail-oriented in their work. They take pride in their performance, strive to avoid mistakes, and demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility.  They are also proactive in taking initiative and helping their team, even when it means going above and beyond. Their willingness to communicate challenges and seek solutions further highlights their conscientious nature.
