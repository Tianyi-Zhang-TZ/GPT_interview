Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a comfort level in social situations, particularly given their experience as a bartender and manager. They appear willing to engage in conversations and participate in group discussions, although they also show a preference for observing and listening initially.  Their willingness to attend the nightclub event, despite not being in their usual social scene, further suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, cleanliness, and attention to detail in their work. They demonstrate a strong work ethic,  taking on challenges and responsibilities with dedication. Their planning and thoughtful approach to career progression also reflect conscientiousness.
