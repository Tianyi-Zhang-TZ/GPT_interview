Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes enjoying social situations, even when initially uncomfortable. They express a desire to connect with others, actively participate in group discussions, and raise the spirits of their team members.  Their answers reveal a preference for social interaction and engagement. 
* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates a strong work ethic and a commitment to accuracy in tasks like medication administration, they also express moments of anxiety and difficulty with organization (e.g., the vacuum cleaner incident). Their desire to avoid mistakes and their focus on achieving goals suggest conscientiousness, but the occasional lapses in attention and organization slightly lower the rating.
