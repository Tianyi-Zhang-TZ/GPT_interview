Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual expresses some discomfort in social situations where they don't know people (Question 1, Question 3, Question 5, Question 7). They seem to prefer smaller, more familiar social settings. While they mention feeling nervous in group discussions (Question 3), they also express a desire to improve in these situations. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to do things correctly (Question 2, Question 4, Question 6, Question 8). They feel relieved when they can put things back in order and describe themselves as anxious about making mistakes. They also mention pushing themselves to complete challenging tasks and carefully paying attention to details. This consistent pattern points to a high level of conscientiousness.
