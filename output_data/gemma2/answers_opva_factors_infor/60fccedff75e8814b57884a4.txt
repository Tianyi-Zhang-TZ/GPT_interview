Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally shy and uncomfortable in social situations with unfamiliar people. They acknowledge feeling anxious in new social settings and needing time to warm up. However, they also demonstrate the ability to become more outgoing and talkative once comfortable. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards the introverted side.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with conscientiousness. They value organization, prefer things to be in their right place, and exhibit a tendency towards perfectionism. They highlight their attention to detail in past jobs and demonstrate a willingness to put in effort to achieve desired outcomes.  While they admit to giving up on tasks when they feel they can't achieve perfection, this doesn't negate their overall conscientious nature.
