Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally easy-going, friendly, and able to converse with people in social settings. They  enjoy group discussions and taking on a leading role, but also acknowledge that they can be tired after work and prefer to skip social events. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with conscientiousness. They are detail-oriented, prefer structure, follow instructions carefully, and dislike making mistakes. They also take initiative to solve problems,  push themselves to complete challenging tasks, and try to avoid passing responsibility to others.  Their desire to be helpful and supportive to their team members further reflects conscientiousness.
