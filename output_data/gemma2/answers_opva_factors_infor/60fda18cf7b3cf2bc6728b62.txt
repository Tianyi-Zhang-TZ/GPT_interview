Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally withdrawn and uncomfortable in new social situations. They acknowledge working on becoming more outgoing but still prefer to stay reserved. While they demonstrate some willingness to step out of their comfort zone in certain situations (e.g., joining social events with friends, leading a training session), these instances seem less frequent and more driven by a desire for personal growth rather than a natural inclination towards social engagement. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize order, organization, and meticulousness in their work. They take their time to ensure accuracy and quality, even when it means taking longer than others. They demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to avoid mistakes. They also show self-awareness and a willingness to work on their weaknesses, such as impulsivity.
