Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a willingness to engage in social situations, even when initially uncomfortable. They show a desire to connect with others and contribute to group discussions. However, there's also a recognition of personal boundaries and a preference for situations with a clear purpose (like work-related events). This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently prioritizes organization, attention to detail, and following through on commitments. They actively seek to improve their performance and demonstrate a strong work ethic. Examples include putting equipment back in its place, meticulously completing surveys, and offering support to a struggling coworker. This pattern points towards a high level of conscientiousness.
