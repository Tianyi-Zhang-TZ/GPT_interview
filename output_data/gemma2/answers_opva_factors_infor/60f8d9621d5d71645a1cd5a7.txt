Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally preferring solitude and finding social situations, especially with unfamiliar people, awkward and stressful. They are more comfortable in familiar settings and enjoy spending time with family. While they can be passionate and express themselves when motivated, they don't appear to actively seek out social interaction or enjoy being the center of attention. This suggests a score leaning towards the lower end of the Extraversion spectrum.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with Conscientiousness. They describe themselves as methodical, detail-oriented, and preferring structured processes. They take responsibility for their tasks, strive for accuracy, and find fulfillment in completing assignments thoroughly.  While they admit to sometimes struggling with highly detailed tasks, their overall emphasis on following through and delivering quality work points towards a higher Conscientiousness score.
