Extraversion: 6 
Conscientiousness: 8 

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:**  The individual displays a clear preference for social interaction and enjoys being around people. They acknowledge their extroverted nature and describe feeling the pull of FOMO. However, they also demonstrate self-awareness by recognizing the need for alone time and recharging.  This suggests a balanced approach to extraversion rather than a highly outgoing or dominant personality.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes attention to detail, planning, and a strong work ethic. They describe themselves as a "stickler for details" and demonstrate a preference for structured work habits with breaks. Their desire to understand the root of problems and find solutions, rather than simply masking them, also points towards a conscientious nature.
