Extraversion: 1.8 
Conscientiousness: 3.2

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses discomfort in social situations, preferring solitude and avoiding interactions when possible. They describe themselves as "not an extrovert" and find small talk "painful." They also avoid social events like the skydiving outing due to fear and a dislike of people. These responses suggest a low level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail in their work. They prioritize accuracy and completion, as seen in their meticulous approach to the mail merge and year-end budget reconciliation. While they delegate the latter task due to fear, they still take responsibility for ensuring its correctness. They also express a desire for job security and high salaries, indicating a value for achievement and competence. These traits point towards a higher level of conscientiousness.
