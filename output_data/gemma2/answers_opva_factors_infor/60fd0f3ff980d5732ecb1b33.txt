Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as enjoying social interactions, taking leading roles in discussions, and valuing connections with people. They express a willingness to participate in social events even when tired, suggesting a preference for social engagement.  However, their initial discomfort in a new social setting hints at a possible lower end of the extraversion spectrum.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual repeatedly emphasizes their organizational skills, attention to detail, hard work ethic, and preference for completing tasks thoroughly. They value tidiness, demonstrate a commitment to avoiding mistakes, and show a tendency to carefully consider situations before acting. These traits strongly point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
