Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Rationale:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual mentions enjoying social settings and taking leadership roles in discussions, their responses also reveal some hesitation and discomfort in unfamiliar social situations. They seem to prefer familiar environments and relationships.  Their desire to avoid the after-work social event due to prior commitments also suggests a preference for structured activities over spontaneous social gatherings. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong emphasis on organization, attention to detail, and following through on tasks. They describe themselves as meticulous, dedicated to providing accurate solutions, and committed to meeting deadlines. Their examples from work highlight their conscientious approach to problem-solving and customer service.
