Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally shy and preferring to be by themselves in social settings they are unfamiliar with. However, they also mention being open to attending larger events and  adapting their behavior based on the group dynamic. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not fully introverted but not highly extroverted either. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently emphasizes their attention to detail,  responsibility, and willingness to put in effort even when facing challenges. They express a strong sense of duty to return equipment and contribute to the team's success. Their thoughtful approach to decision-making and aversion to impulsivity further solidify their high conscientiousness score.
