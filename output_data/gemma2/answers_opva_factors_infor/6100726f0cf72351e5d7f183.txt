Extraversion: 3.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes enjoying social events but often preferring to arrive late or leave early. They value listening in discussions and finding common ground but don't necessarily seek to be the center of attention. Their desire to spend time with family over work social events also suggests a preference for smaller, more intimate settings.  

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail. They prioritize leaving workspaces better than they found them, meticulously double-check their work, and strive to complete tasks thoroughly. They also show a willingness to seek help when needed and take ownership of their work.  Their drive to obtain a desired position and their ability to re-assess and move forward after not getting it showcase their ambition and dedication.
