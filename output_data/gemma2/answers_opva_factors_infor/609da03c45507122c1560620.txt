Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual demonstrates a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. While they express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and initially prefer solitude, they also show a willingness to take on leadership roles in discussions and a desire to connect with others in a less formal setting (like a lab party). This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes the importance of organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. They describe feeling overwhelmed when faced with a challenging project but also express a strong desire to see it through. Their tendency to become hyper-focused and stressed when accuracy is paramount indicates a high level of conscientiousness.  

**Note:** These ratings are based on a limited sample of self-reported responses. A more comprehensive assessment would involve additional data points and standardized measures.
