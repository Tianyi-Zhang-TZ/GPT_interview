Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and often prefers to initiate conversations with one person in social settings rather than engaging with a larger group. They also tend to avoid after-work social events. However, they demonstrate some comfort in group discussions and are willing to step out of their comfort zone for certain opportunities. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their attention to detail, organizational skills, and desire to complete tasks meticulously. They strive for perfection, go above and beyond to leave things in order, and actively seek guidance to overcome challenges rather than leaving them undone. Their responses clearly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
