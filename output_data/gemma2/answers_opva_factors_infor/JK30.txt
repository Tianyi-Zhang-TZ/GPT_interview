Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 2.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently expresses enjoyment in social situations, meeting new people, and engaging in group discussions. They describe themselves as open-minded and comfortable leading or listening in group settings. While they acknowledge some initial shyness, their overall preference for social interaction leans towards extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual presents a mixed picture regarding conscientiousness. They admit to being messy at times and procrastinating on tasks. However, they also demonstrate a desire to meet expectations at work and a willingness to put effort into tasks when motivated. Their tendency to procrastinate and struggle with details suggests a lower level of conscientiousness, but their desire to contribute to a team and achieve goals hints at some conscientious tendencies.
