Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 2.0

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual occasionally mentions enjoying social settings and participating in group discussions. However, they also express discomfort in unfamiliar social situations and admit to not being a confident speaker. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual struggles to recall specific instances demonstrating high conscientiousness. Their answers often seem disorganized and lack detailed examples of planning, organization, or attention to detail.  This points towards a lower level of conscientiousness. 


**Important Note:**  It's crucial to remember that personality assessments based solely on brief, open-ended responses can be limited. A more comprehensive evaluation would require standardized questionnaires and potentially further interviews to gain a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the individual's personality.
