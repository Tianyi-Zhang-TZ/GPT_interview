They express anxiety in social situations and sometimes struggle to contribute in group discussions. However, they also show a willingness to step outside their comfort zone and engage with colleagues, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of organization and responsibility. They prioritize tidiness, attention to detail, and completing tasks efficiently. They also reflect on their actions and make thoughtful decisions, even when it comes to personal purchases. Their desire to learn and improve further supports a high conscientiousness score.
