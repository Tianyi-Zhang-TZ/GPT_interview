Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as generally reserved in unfamiliar social situations, preferring to observe and not initiate conversation. However, they also acknowledge a shift towards being more outgoing when taking on a leadership role or in structured school settings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion but capable of increased sociability in certain contexts. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and organization. They express frustration when equipment is left disorganized and emphasize their focus and drive when tasks require meticulous attention to detail. While they admit to becoming more irritable under pressure, their overall emphasis on orderliness and completion suggests a high level of conscientiousness.
