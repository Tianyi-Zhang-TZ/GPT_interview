Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:**  While the individual describes themselves as generally social, they also express discomfort and shyness in unfamiliar social settings. Their preference for solitude and avoidance of mandatory social events point towards a lower extraversion score. However, they demonstrate an ability to lead and contribute in group discussions, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently emphasizes their carefulness, attention to detail, persistence, and strong work ethic. They demonstrate a clear commitment to responsibility and fulfilling tasks thoroughly. Their actions, like returning borrowed equipment and diligently managing work assignments, further solidify their high conscientiousness score.
