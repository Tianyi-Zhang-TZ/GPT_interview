Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual expresses a preference for smaller social circles and admits to shyness in unfamiliar social settings, they also demonstrate a willingness to step into leadership roles in academic and work-related discussions. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, leaning towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently displays traits associated with high conscientiousness. They value order, neatness, and attention to detail. They are hardworking, take responsibility seriously, and strive for accuracy, even going to great lengths to avoid burdening others. Their responses clearly indicate a strong commitment to their work and a desire to perform well.
