Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual consistently describes themselves as outgoing, friendly, and enjoys social interaction. They express comfort in meeting new people and actively seek out conversations. Their role as vice president in a student organization further supports their inclination towards leadership and engagement. 

* **Conscientiousness:** While the individual demonstrates traits of organization and focus, there are instances where impulsivity and lack of careful consideration are evident.  Their purchase of the perfume using a credit card despite financial constraints suggests a tendency to act on impulse rather than carefully plan.
