Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes feeling nervous in a new social situation, preferring to gauge the room and observe before actively participating. While they acknowledge enjoying new experiences, their initial reaction leans towards caution rather than outgoing enthusiasm.  They also express a preference for solitude in their free time, skipping after-work social events. These responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and organization. They prioritize completing tasks accurately, meticulously double-checking their work, and seeking structure (like outlines) when dealing with details. They also express a commitment to ethical behavior at work, resisting the temptation to engage in theft despite witnessing it.  Their actions and self-description point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
