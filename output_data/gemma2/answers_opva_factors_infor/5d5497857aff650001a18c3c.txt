Extraversion: 3 
Conscientiousness: 6 

**Reasoning:**

* **Extraversion:** While the individual enjoys collaborative situations and can be a cheerleader for their team, they generally prefer to avoid after-work social events and express discomfort with building close relationships with colleagues. This suggests a preference for smaller social circles and a tendency towards introversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates high levels of detail-orientation, takes responsibility for their work, and strives for accuracy. They also express a strong sense of personal guilt when mistakes occur and actively seek to avoid them. These traits strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
