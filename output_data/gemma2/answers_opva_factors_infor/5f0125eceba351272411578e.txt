Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as introverted and prefers alone time. They acknowledge feeling anxiety in social situations and often choose to avoid them. However, they also express a desire to grow and step outside their comfort zone, suggesting a potential for increased extraversion in the future.  Their willingness to participate in staff meetings and host a podcast also indicates some level of comfort with social interaction. 

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits of conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. They take pride in their work, strive for accuracy, and seek feedback to improve. Their examples of managing schedules, handling equipment responsibly, and showing empathy towards a colleague all point towards a highly conscientious personality.
