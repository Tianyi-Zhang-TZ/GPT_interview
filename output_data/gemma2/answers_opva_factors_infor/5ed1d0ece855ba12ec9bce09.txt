Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as an "introverted extrovert," indicating a preference for smaller social settings and a need for solitude but also a strong enjoyment of social interaction and energy from being around people. Their willingness to participate in group discussions and their enthusiasm for after-work social events suggest a moderate level of extraversion.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high conscientiousness. They prioritize organization, attention to detail, and completing tasks thoroughly. They describe themselves as hardworking, self-motivated, and diligent. Their preference for independently tackling challenges and their commitment to accuracy and quality in their work further support a high rating on conscientiousness.
