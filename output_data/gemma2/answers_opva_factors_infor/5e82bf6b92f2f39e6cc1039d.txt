Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "very extroverted" and enjoys social situations. They readily initiate conversations and find comfort in interacting with new people. However, they also acknowledge instances where they felt less comfortable in unfamiliar social settings. This suggests a moderate level of extraversion, not always seeking the spotlight but comfortable engaging with others.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual consistently demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail, particularly in their work as a pharmacist. They prioritize accuracy, organization, and completing tasks thoroughly. They also express discomfort passing on challenging tasks, preferring to tackle them themselves. These examples point towards a high level of conscientiousness.
