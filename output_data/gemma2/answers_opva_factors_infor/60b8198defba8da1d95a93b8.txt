Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as "reserved," "quiet," and preferring to "observe" rather than lead in social situations. They acknowledge enjoying socialization but often need to "twist their own arm" to attend events. While they can be comforting and empathetic, they don't seem to actively seek out social interaction or enjoy being the center of attention. This points towards a lower score on Extraversion. 

* **Conscientiousness:**  The individual consistently demonstrates traits associated with high Conscientiousness. They prioritize order and organization, taking extra time to clean up after work and meticulously filling out detailed paperwork. They are described as "detail-oriented," "patient," "intelligent," and committed to doing things correctly the first time. Their willingness to take on challenging tasks and their focus on accuracy and thoroughness further support a high Conscientiousness score.
