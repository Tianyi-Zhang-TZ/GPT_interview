Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

**Justification:**

* **Extraversion:** The individual describes themselves as more of a listener than a talker and often avoids social events due to nervousness and shyness. While they express a desire to be more social and build connections, their current behavior suggests a preference for solitude and less outgoing tendencies. This points towards a score closer to the lower end of the Extraversion spectrum.

* **Conscientiousness:** The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and organization, even if they admit to occasional struggles. They prioritize completing tasks thoroughly, paying attention to detail, and seeking clarification when needed. They also express a desire to improve their organizational skills and strive to be reliable and dependable. These traits align with a higher score on the Conscientiousness scale.
