Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5 

Explanation:

The Conscientiousness score is based on the traits that indicate organization, attention to detail, and responsibility in handling tasks and responsibilities at work and social events. The individual's answers suggest a strong sense of responsibility towards completing tasks correctly and efficiently, showing a high level of conscientiousness.

The Extraversion score takes into account the person's tendency to be outgoing, sociable, and able to engage with others easily. Although they display some aspects of extraversion in certain situations (like team projects or charity events), their responses also suggest that they can come across as somewhat reserved or withdrawn at times, indicating a lower level of extraversion compared to someone who might be more naturally outgoing in all contexts.

This overall assessment suggests that the individual is generally reliable and responsible but may not thrive in highly social situations.
