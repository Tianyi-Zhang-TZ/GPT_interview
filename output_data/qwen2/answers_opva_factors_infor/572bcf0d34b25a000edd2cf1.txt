Conscientiousness: 4.3 
Extraversion: 3.7 

The personality score is based on the given answers to questions related to different aspects of personality according to the HEXACO model (6-factor model). The individual appears to be generally conscientious and organized, which aligns with high scores in Conscientiousness factor due to their attention to details, willingness to handle challenging tasks by themselves and organization skills. However, they seem less extroverted or outgoing based on their tendency towards shyness and reserved behavior in unfamiliar social situations until they find interest, which is reflected by lower score for Extraversion.

The detailed reasons are:

For Conscientiousness:
1) The individual shows a proactive attitude towards handling challenging tasks rather than avoiding them. They think outside the box to solve problems efficiently.
2) They maintain focus on details and manage time well, showing they are organized and plan their work effectively.
3) They exhibit willingness to help others by being a morale booster when team members feel down.

For Extraversion:
1) Though they can engage in conversations once interested, they tend to be shy or reserved until then. This implies that they don't naturally crave social interaction or outgoing behavior.
2) Their preference for listening instead of leading suggests that they are comfortable with being supportive rather than taking the center stage in unfamiliar social situations.
3) They consider fatigue and other commitments when deciding on attending social events, suggesting a moderate level of engagement with social activities.

The score is not precisely split between questions due to the nature of subjective assessments and interpretation of personality from responses.
