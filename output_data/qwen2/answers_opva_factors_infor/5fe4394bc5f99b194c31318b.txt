Conscientiousness: 8/10  
Extraversion: 6/10

The individual described shows a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their ability to focus on details and avoid mistakes in complex tasks like biochemistry tests. They plan ahead, are organized, and can manage their time effectively under pressure. This is supported by their strategy of analyzing questions carefully before attempting answers.

On the other hand, while this person values social interaction and enjoys parties when they align with their preferences (not interfering with work or personal life too much), they do not overly prioritize being extroverted in every situation. Their preference for being social when it benefits them rather than leading to discomfort suggests a moderate level of extraversion that is context-dependent.

In summary, this person demonstrates strong conscientiousness due to their ability to handle detailed tasks effectively and plan strategically, while showing a more balanced personality type with respect to extraversion, as they are not overly driven by social interaction but appreciate it in moderation.
