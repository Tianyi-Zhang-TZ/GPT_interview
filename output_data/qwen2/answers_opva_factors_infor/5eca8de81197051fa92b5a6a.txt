Conscientiousness: 6/10

I would rate my personality as having a moderately high level of conscientiousness, mainly due to the fact that I tend to consider details and strive for perfection in tasks, especially when avoiding mistakes is crucial. This trait is evident in my desire to ensure accuracy in work outcomes without necessarily being an inherently detail-oriented person by nature.

Extraversion: 4/10

My personality leans slightly towards introversion, which manifests through my occasional need for alone time and more reserved nature in social settings. However, I can adapt to situations where interaction with others is necessary and enjoy sharing jokes or providing emotional support when needed. This balance between introversion and extroversion allows me to engage effectively both independently and within group environments.
