Conscientiousness: 4/5

The individual in this scenario exhibits a moderate level of conscientiousness as shown by their ability to focus on tasks that require attention to detail, especially in school or work situations where they can efficiently push out the required work and double-check for mistakes. Their cautious approach towards minimizing risks at work also aligns with being conscientious.

Extraversion: 2/5

The individual appears to be relatively introverted as demonstrated by their preference for quiet environments, nervousness when meeting new people, and tendency to engage more comfortably in social settings after work like salsa dancing. Their behavior of keeping distance from team members who are feeling down indicates they might prefer not to intrude or seek attention from others.

The ratings reflect a balanced mix between conscientiousness and introversion based on the individual's traits described throughout the questions, with a slightly higher emphasis on conscientiousness due to their focus on details and cautious approach in work scenarios.
