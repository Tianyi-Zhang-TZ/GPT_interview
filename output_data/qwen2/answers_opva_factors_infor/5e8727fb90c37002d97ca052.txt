Conscientiousness: 4/5
Extraversion: 3/5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness refers to traits such as being organized, dependable, and responsible. In the provided scenarios, we see the individual demonstrating a high degree of attention to detail (when reading patient charts) and being thoughtful in making decisions that consider others' well-being and their own limitations (choosing not to take on too much work). This aligns with a 4/5 rating for Conscientiousness. They show responsibility by carefully considering the impact of their actions, which is characteristic of conscientious individuals.

Extraversion involves traits like energy, sociability, and assertiveness. The individual shares experiences that involve engaging with others in social situations (embracing company outings) and leading a team as captain for a soccer team. However, there's also mention of over-scheduling oneself, which might suggest some introverted tendencies or the need to balance social engagements with personal reflection. This leads to an overall 3/5 rating for Extraversion, indicating that while they enjoy social situations and are involved in leadership roles that require interaction, they also show a preference for more solitary activities like detailed work.

The ratings take into account both positive contributions within each trait (e.g., being detail-oriented and organized vs. engaging socially) as well as signs of balance or potential areas needing attention based on the individual's experiences shared (e.g., over-scheduling suggesting a mix of social and introspective tendencies).
