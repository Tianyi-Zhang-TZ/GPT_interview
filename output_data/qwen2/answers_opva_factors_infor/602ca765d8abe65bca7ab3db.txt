Conscientiousness: High 
Extraversion: Moderately Low 

Explanation:

Conscientiousness, often associated with traits like being organized, responsible, and goal-oriented, seems to align well with the provided text sample. The person is described as cautious about their actions around others, particularly concerned about avoiding embarrassment or causing harm or dislike from others. They also exhibit a certain level of introspection and empathy for others' emotions, suggesting they are attuned to societal norms and expectations. This high degree of concern for maintaining social harmony aligns with the conscientious personality trait.

Extraversion, which is associated with traits like sociability, energy, and assertiveness, presents a different picture. The person appears more introverted or reserved in their approach, preferring to leave others alone when they are not themselves rather than initiating direct inquiries into their emotional state. This preference for solitude or indirect interaction suggests a lower level of extraversion.

Therefore, considering the text sample as a whole, one might rate the individual's Conscientiousness as high and Extraversion as moderately low based on their described behaviors and responses to social situations.
