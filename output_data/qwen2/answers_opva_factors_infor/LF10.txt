Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 4.0 

Justification:

Conscientiousness (Factor):
- The individual shows signs of being organized and orderly, which is a hallmark of conscientiousness. They were tidy with equipment at work and demonstrated good planning skills to achieve tasks efficiently.
- Mentioning that they always think about the importance of finishing work as well as starting it suggests high levels of organization and responsibility.

Extraversion (Factor):
- The person describes themselves as social, outgoing, and being very comfortable in new situations. They also show empathy towards colleagues who are feeling down, which indicates a sociable personality.
- Sharing their strategy when faced with challenging tasks involves asking questions and gathering information - this reveals their proactive nature, typically associated with extraversion.

These responses indicate that the individual exhibits traits of both conscientiousness and extraversion. However, they lean slightly more towards being conscientious based on their answers regarding task organization and finishing work neatly. The person's social behavior might suggest a slightly lower rating in terms of extraversion, though still quite high considering their open and friendly nature. Therefore, the overall personality score would be 4.5 for Conscientiousness and 4.0 for Extraversion.
