Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.2

Explanation:

- For Conscientiousness, the individual consistently demonstrates traits such as responsibility and self-discipline. They push themselves outside their comfort zones, pay attention to details in demanding tasks, and aim for excellence at work. These behaviors align well with high levels of conscientiousness.

- For Extraversion, while not as strong as Conscientiousness, there are instances where the individual seeks social interaction, such as attending a library Christmas party. However, they also express a preference for introverted activities like doing data entry alone and listening rather than leading group discussions. This pattern suggests moderate levels of extraversion.

Overall, these behaviors suggest that this person exhibits strong conscientiousness with traits of responsibility and discipline, but has more variable tendencies in terms of social interaction and assertiveness (extraversion).
