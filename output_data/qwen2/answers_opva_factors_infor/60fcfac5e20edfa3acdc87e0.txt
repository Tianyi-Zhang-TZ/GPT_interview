Conscientiousness: 5/5  
Extraversion: 3/5  

Explanation:

The individual demonstrates a high level of Conscientiousness, as they are described to handle stressful situations well by focusing and channeling stress into their work, being detail-oriented, analytical, thorough in their responsibilities, and managing morale within the team effectively. This personality trait allows them to successfully manage tasks under pressure, understand the needs of others, and make considerate decisions for the benefit of both themselves and those around them.

On the other hand, while they display some traits of Extraversion such as empathy and understanding when addressing low morale among crew members, their response suggests a more reserved approach to social interactions at work. They opt not to act impulsively in professional settings but rather choose responsibilities that align with loyalty and teamwork over personal ambitions or competitive behaviors. This indicates a moderate level of Extraversion where they prioritize professionalism and relationships within the workplace environment.

The rating system takes into account the degree to which each personality trait is evident in their responses, with Conscientiousness being consistently high due to the focus on responsibility and detail management, while Extraversion receives a slightly lower rating because it does not dominate their professional behavior as much as Conscientiousness.
