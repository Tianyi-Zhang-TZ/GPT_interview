Conscientiousness: 4.2 
Extraversion: 3.8 

Explanation: 

The responses show a higher degree of conscientiousness, particularly in managing stress and performing tasks that require attention to detail. This is reflected in their ability to manage stressful situations with humor and confidence (Question 1), meticulous approach towards task completion at the beginning of the year (Question 2), comfortable presentation skills even if taking the leadership role isn't preferred (Question 3), willingness to take on challenging tasks rather than avoiding them (Question 4), prioritizing social events due to enjoyment of their team dynamic and ability to be themselves (Question 5), attention to details in scheduling tasks over phone (Question 6) and proactive approach in uplifting team spirits when needed (Question 7).

However, the responses also exhibit traits typical of extraversion. The individual enjoys being in social settings as seen by actively engaging with colleagues during after-work events and prioritizing this aspect for team comfortability (Question 5). There's a clear preference for interactions and fun activities over work-related tasks when they are enjoyable and involve humor and jokes (Question 1), which is indicative of extraversion. They also demonstrate an ability to provide emotional support to their colleagues, indicating sociable behavior associated with extraversion (Question 7).

The ratings slightly lean towards conscientiousness due to the consistent demonstration of task management skills, stress handling capabilities under pressure, and strategic thinking before making decisions or actions, which are more characteristic traits of conscientious individuals. However, they also exhibit extraverted tendencies through their enjoyment in social settings and ability to engage with others, contributing to a balanced personality.
