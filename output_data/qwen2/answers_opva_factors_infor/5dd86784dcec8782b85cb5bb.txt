Extraversion: 3.8 

The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility, organization and focus on detail, which aligns well with the Conscientiousness factor. This is evident from their tendency to prepare thoroughly before engaging in group discussions or tasks that require attention to details, and their meticulous approach towards equipment usage and data handling at work.

In terms of Extraversion, while they do not appear overly extroverted, they are able to engage in social interactions when necessary, such as during after-work events.
