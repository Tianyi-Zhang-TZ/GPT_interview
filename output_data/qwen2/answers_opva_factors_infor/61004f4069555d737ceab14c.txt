Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.8 

Justification:

The person exhibits traits that align well with the factor of Conscientiousness, which includes meticulous attention to detail, strong organization skills, and a tendency towards careful decision-making rather than acting impulsively. This is reflected in their responses about tasks requiring accuracy, team members needing spirit boosts, and decisions around after-work social events where comfort with colleagues influences participation.

On Extraversion, the individual shows more reserved behavior patterns but does engage when necessary to support others or provide company. Their involvement in listening roles during times of team member's distress suggests a capacity for empathy and relational warmth. However, they are not particularly inclined towards spontaneous social gatherings outside their immediate circle of friends at work.

The Conscientiousness rating is higher because the individual consistently demonstrates behaviors that align with this trait across various scenarios, showing reliability and organization.

The Extraversion rating is lower due to a lack of enthusiasm and a preference for solitary tasks or situations where they can exercise more introspection before engaging in social settings. While they are not completely disinclined towards social interactions, their responses suggest they are selective about these engagements based on familiarity with individuals involved.

In summary, the individual leans slightly more towards being Conscientious than Extraverted, as shown by their consistent ability to demonstrate reliability and attention to detail alongside a somewhat reserved approach to interpersonal relationships and social situations.
