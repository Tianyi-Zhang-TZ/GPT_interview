Conscientiousness: 4/5
Extraversion: 3/5

The individual in these situations demonstrates traits consistent with high levels of conscientiousness and lower levels of extraversion.

In the first situation, when dealing with assembling a crib carefully to ensure safety for the child, this person exhibits a strong level of conscientiousness. The individual meticulously reads instructions multiple times, verifies each step, and exercises patience and carefulness throughout the process. This demonstrates an attention to detail, responsibility, and a sense of duty towards ensuring safety.

In the second situation involving the tragic loss of a new team member's son, the person shows empathy and care for their colleagues' emotional state despite feeling helpless in addressing the situation directly. They recognize the need to support their team but struggle with finding appropriate actions that could effectively lift their spirits given the gravity of the loss. This scenario highlights conscientiousness through the consideration of others' well-being and a thoughtful approach.

The third situation, where the individual acted impulsively to secure personal sales goals at work by breaking established rules, does not align as strongly with high conscientiousness due to disregarding organizational policies for the sake of individual achievement. However, this action demonstrates a level of ambition and determination that could be seen in someone who is highly goal-oriented.

Regarding extraversion, throughout these scenarios, there's an underlying sense of reserved behavior when compared to situations that might require more extroverted traits such as social engagement or assertive communication. For example, handling grief with sensitivity and refraining from sharing personal emotions publicly are reflective of lower levels of extraversion. The individual tends to prioritize empathy over direct emotional expression, suggesting a moderate level of extraversion.

The 4/5 rating for conscientiousness is due to the demonstration of traits like diligence, responsibility, and careful planning across different scenarios. The 3/5 rating for extraversion acknowledges the presence of empathetic qualities in challenging times but also highlights less sociable behaviors that might indicate a preference for more solitary or thoughtful interactions.

These ratings are overall assessments based on the provided examples rather than specific evaluations for each question individually.
