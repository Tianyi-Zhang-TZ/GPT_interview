This high level of conscientiousness is also reflected in their proactive approach towards potential issues such as clarifying ambiguous tasks or reaching out for help when needed.

Regarding Extraversion, the individual shows mixed traits. They enjoy social events and interacting with colleagues (Questions 1, 3, 5), indicating they are more outgoing than introverted.
