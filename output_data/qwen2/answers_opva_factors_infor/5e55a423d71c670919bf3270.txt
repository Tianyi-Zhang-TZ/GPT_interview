Conscientiousness: 5/5  
Extraversion: 4/5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is shown through the examples provided as both individuals prioritize attention to detail and take initiative, which are key aspects of this personality trait. In woodworking, they meticulously craft a bandsaw box with detailed layers, displaying care and precision. This results in a feeling of satisfaction upon completion. They also show conscientious behavior when managing the spirit for cheerleading's "powder puff" event by lying to boost team morale despite their initial concerns about winning.

Extraversion is demonstrated through social interactions that bring energy and excitement. They motivate peers and enjoy being part of group activities like cheerleading or working with a group in camp settings, which are indicators of this trait. However, there's also a sense of responsibility for others' well-being shown when they consider not lying about winning the pep rally to avoid seeming selfish.

The ratings reflect these consistent behaviors across situations that require attention to detail and social engagement.
