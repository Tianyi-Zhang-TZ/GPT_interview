Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.2

Explanation:

**Conscientiousness**: This person scores relatively high in this trait as demonstrated by their attention to detail, ability to work through tasks carefully and slowly, and motivation towards accuracy. They are also motivated by social aspects, such as ensuring their work quality matches the expectation of receiving money at a bank. These behaviors suggest responsibility, organization, and diligence, which are characteristic of a high Conscientiousness score.

**Extraversion**: The person shows some signs of extraversion in their desire to avoid bringing down team spirits and their consideration for others when making decisions that affect them negatively. However, they also indicate reluctance to join after-work social events and a preference towards working instead of attending these events. This suggests they might not be as outgoing or socially engaging compared to someone who frequently attends such events. The score reflects an overall moderate level of extraversion due to both positive (caring for others) and negative behaviors related to social contexts.

These scores are based on the comprehensive review of behaviors across all questions, with a focus on traits that define Conscientiousness (responsibility, diligence) and Extraversion (social engagement, outgoing behavior).
