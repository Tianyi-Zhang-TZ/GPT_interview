Conscientiousness: High 
Extraversion: Low

The individual described in this text shows a high level of Conscientiousness, as they demonstrate responsibility and thoroughness when dealing with tasks that require attention to detail and maintaining focus throughout the process. This is evident in their enjoyment and skill at playing chess, where even minor mistakes can lead to losing a game entirely due to negligence.

On the other hand, the individual exhibits a low level of Extraversion, as they prefer spending time with friends from their school community rather than attending events that involve people outside this circle. They show more reserved behavior when considering attending social events and prioritize making memories in situations where they can relax without work responsibilities interfering.

The combination of high Conscientiousness and low Extraversion suggests a preference for structured tasks, strong self-discipline, and value for personal space and time spent with familiar company rather than seeking out new experiences or being active in large social settings.
