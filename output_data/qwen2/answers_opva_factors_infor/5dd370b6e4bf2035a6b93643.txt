Conscientiousness: 6/10  
Extraversion: 3/10  

The person described shows a generally conscientious personality, as evidenced by their inclination towards paying attention to details and being motivated to raise the spirits of team members in down times. They are also somewhat thoughtful before acting impulsively, which aligns with conscientiousness traits like planning ahead and considering consequences.

On the other hand, they demonstrate introverted tendencies when it comes to social events, preferring to either skip them or feeling uncomfortable attending due to shyness. Their response towards wanting something badly at work is characterized by careful consideration rather than impulsive action, which supports the conscientiousness factor over extraversion.

In summary:
- Conscientiousness: 6/10 indicates a moderate level of conscientiousness. The individual values responsibility and organization but also has an introverted side that may occasionally conflict with this trait.
- Extraversion: 3/10 suggests they are relatively reserved in their social interactions, showing a preference for personal space and introspection over outgoing behavior or engagement in large social settings.

The balance between these traits suggests a complex personality where conscientious traits like organization and planning are dominant alongside an introverted nature that influences decision-making in social situations.
