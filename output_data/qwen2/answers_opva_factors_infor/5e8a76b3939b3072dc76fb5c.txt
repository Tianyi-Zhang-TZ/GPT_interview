Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 2.5 

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their ability to plan and organize tasks effectively (Questions 2 & 6), strive for accuracy, and ensure that they are well-prepared in challenging situations (Question 4). They also show some inclination towards being helpful and supportive when dealing with team members who are feeling down or others needing assistance during group discussions (Questions 5 & 7).

On the other hand, their level of extraversion appears to be relatively low. This is indicated by their preference for a more introverted nature, often choosing to stay in the background during social situations, prioritizing being helpful rather than leading conversations or asserting themselves as leaders (Questions 1, 3, & 8). They seem comfortable and somewhat reserved when engaging with others they don't know, which points towards an introverted personality.
