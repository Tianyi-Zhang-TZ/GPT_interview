Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Medium

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated high due to the individual's demonstrated traits such as paying attention to details, being meticulous in tasks, aiming to avoid making mistakes, and valuing a supportive work environment which encourages deep connections with colleagues. These behaviors align with someone who is highly conscientious.

Extraversion is rated medium because while the person enjoys connecting with coworkers and values shared interests, there's no strong indication of needing constant social interaction or leading others in social activities. The individual seems to balance social engagement with work responsibilities well, which suggests a moderate level of extraversion.
