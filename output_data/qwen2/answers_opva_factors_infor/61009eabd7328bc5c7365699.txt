Based on your responses, here are the overall ratings for Conscientiousness and Extraversion:

Conscientiousness: 7  
- You demonstrated traits such as being detail-oriented, patient, focused on accuracy, able to handle long periods of work with attention to detail. These behaviors align well with a high level of conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 4
- Your responses suggest you're generally comfortable in social settings when familiar with the people involved but tend to be shy and prefer to know others before engaging deeply. This indicates moderate levels of extraversion where you are somewhat outgoing yet also value introverted aspects of your personality.

The ratings reflect a balanced nature leaning more towards conscientiousness due to traits like attention to detail, patience, and dedication in tasks requiring focus on accuracy. In contrast, extraversion shows variability based on familiarity and comfort with others, indicating that while you can be social, deeper engagement requires a sense of ease and connection with the people around you.
