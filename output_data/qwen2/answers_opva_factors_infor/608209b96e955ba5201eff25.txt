Conscientiousness: 4.0  
Extraversion: 2.5  

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their meticulous attention to detail and organization when sorting silverware post-work tasks, ability to take charge in group projects indicating planning and responsibility, and decision-making skills that show the willingness to prioritize self-care and practicality over potentially challenging situations.

On the other hand, while they do occasionally engage with unfamiliar social settings (like college move-in or Bible camp), their preference for solitary activities like napping or using an online platform suggests a more introverted nature. Their hesitance in joining events where they don't know many people indicates that social interactions are not as naturally fulfilling to them.

The rating is 4.0 for Conscientiousness because of the consistent demonstration of responsibility and practicality, and it's rated at 2.5 for Extraversion due to some social engagement but with a leaning towards introversion indicated by the preference for solo activities or avoiding situations where they are uncomfortable socially.
