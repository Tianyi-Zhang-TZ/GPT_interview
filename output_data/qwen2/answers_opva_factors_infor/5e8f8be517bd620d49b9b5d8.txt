Conscientiousness: 4.5  
Extraversion: 3.8  

Justification:

For Conscientiousness, the individual has shown a strong ability to organize tasks and responsibilities in Question 2 (high), exhibits diligence by cleaning up after using equipment and considering others' space (medium), but also some tendency for conscientious behavior based on social context or peer pressure as seen in Question 7 (low). The overall rating for Conscientiousness is thus moderately high due to the consistent display of responsible behaviors.

For Extraversion, the individual displays a proactive approach to initiating conversations and bonding with new people in unfamiliar settings (high), enjoys talking about shared interests like food and weather (medium), and tends to listen more than speak during group discussions (low). This leads to an overall rating that suggests a balanced but slightly inclined towards introverted side of Extraversion.
