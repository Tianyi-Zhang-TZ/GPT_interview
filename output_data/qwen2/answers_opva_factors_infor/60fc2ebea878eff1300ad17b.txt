Conscientiousness: 6  
Extraversion: 5  

Explanation: 

The provided text doesn't provide a direct way to rate Conscientiousness and Extraversion based on the given information about emotions, decision-making in different situations at work, and shopping habits.

From the description:

- **Conscientiousness** seems to be around medium-high (6), as indicated by actions like budget planning for impulse buying. This suggests a strong sense of responsibility and planning, which aligns with Conscientiousness traits.

- **Extraversion** appears also at a medium level (5). The speaker's preference for maintaining a consistent level of happiness without needing to manage mental health too much suggests they likely don't require significant social stimulation or energy. They seem capable of enjoying solitude and are not overly driven by external social environments, which is characteristic of someone with a lower Extraversion score.

It's worth noting that while these ratings provide an overall impression based on the text given, they rely heavily on subjective interpretation since no specific questions or scenarios directly tied to Conscientiousness (like organization, planning) and Extraversion (like social interaction preferences, excitement levels in different situations) were provided.
