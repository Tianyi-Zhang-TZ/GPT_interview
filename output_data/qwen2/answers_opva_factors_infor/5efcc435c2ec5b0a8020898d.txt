Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5 

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated as a '4' because the individual demonstrates responsibility and care towards ensuring their team members are doing well emotionally at work, which shows attention to detail and concern for workplace environment. They also seem aware of how mistakes can be avoided in the future by sharing insights with their co-workers about what led to those mistakes.

Extraversion is rated as a '3' because while there's an indication of social interaction and wanting to help others when they're feeling down, it seems that this person prefers to let their friends decide if they want help or not. Additionally, the response does not include any examples of them acting on impulses in social situations at work, which is typically associated with higher levels of extraversion.

The ratings take into consideration both behaviors and responses provided across all three questions related to these personality factors.
