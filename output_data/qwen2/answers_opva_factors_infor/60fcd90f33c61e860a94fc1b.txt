Conscientiousness: 5/5

Extraversion: 4/5

Explanation:

The individual in this description seems to exhibit a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their meticulous attention to detail when helping a friend remodel his room and the organized nature they display in various situations. This trait also comes through in their thoughtful encouragement during a soccer game to focus on enjoying the process rather than getting too caught up in winning or losing.

The individual displays some degree of extraversion, indicated by their willingness to take initiative, advocate for themselves and others when it came to workplace raises, and generally engage in social situations. They are not overly outgoing but do show extroverted tendencies through these actions. However, they also display a more introverted side when preferring solitude or choosing not to exert energy on texting after work, which suggests a balanced personality with a moderate level of extraversion.

The conscientiousness score reflects their strong organizational skills and attention to detail, while the extraversion rating acknowledges their social engagement without overstepping into overly outgoing behavior.
