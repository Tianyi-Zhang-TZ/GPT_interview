- The ability to manage tasks effectively is evident through decisions like those made during Question 1 regarding task management.
- Displaying leadership qualities by initiating conversations for morale improvement (Question 7) shows a proactive approach to teamwork, which is also a part of conscientiousness.

For Extraversion: 
- There's evidence of social interaction and assertiveness in expressing concerns about team morale (Question 7), indicating some level of extraversion.
- However, there are instances where the individual seems more inclined towards solitude or self-directed actions like deciding to attend an event on their own (Question 8) rather than engaging actively with others.
