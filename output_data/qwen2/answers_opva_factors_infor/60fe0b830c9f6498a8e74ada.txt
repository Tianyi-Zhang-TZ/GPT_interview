Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.5 

Explanation:

Conscientiousness involves aspects like organization, responsibility, and diligence. The individual demonstrated traits such as putting things back in order after using equipment (Question 2), taking leadership roles when comfortable with the subject matter (Question 3), being detail-oriented when required to avoid mistakes (Question 6), and trying to help raise spirits of team members when feeling down (Question 7). These behaviors suggest a high level of responsibility, organization, and diligence, hence scoring highly on Conscientiousness.

Extraversion involves social interaction, assertiveness, and energy. The individual indicated that they often skip larger events due to feelings of discomfort and worry about their performance in public settings (Question 5), which suggests less of an extraverted personality. However, there was a positive inclination towards being optimistic and taking charge when team members were feeling down during work-related scenarios (Question 7). This shows some extroverted traits but not as pronounced compared to other aspects. 

The scores are rounded due to the overlapping nature of these traits with conscientiousness (e.g., someone who is diligent might also be slightly more extraverted in social settings) and the individual's responses suggesting a balanced personality rather than extreme tendencies towards either trait.

Overall, this person is likely conscientious and generally social but not overly so, hence the scores provided.
