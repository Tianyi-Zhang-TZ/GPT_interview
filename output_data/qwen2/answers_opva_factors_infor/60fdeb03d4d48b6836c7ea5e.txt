Based on your responses, it appears that you have high levels of both Conscientiousness and Extraversion.

Conscientiousness: Rating 4/5

You demonstrated high conscientiousness in the tasks where paying attention to detail was crucial. Your focus, determination to avoid errors, and meticulousness show strong traits of this personality factor. You also sought to improve your performance by being organized, using "do not disturb" settings on your phone, ensuring social conversations were minimized, and thoroughly double-checking your work before submission. This shows an emphasis on responsibility and diligence.

Extraversion: Rating 4/5

Your interactions with team members during happy hours indicate that you possess strong extraversion traits. You overcame initial feelings of intimidation to network and connect with colleagues by actively seeking out conversations. Your desire to make friends, share personal interests and goals, and portray yourself as a friendly team player aligns well with extraverted characteristics. This suggests an outgoing nature and the ability to engage socially.

In conclusion, your personality traits across both factors highlight qualities of responsibility, diligence (Conscientiousness), and sociability, assertiveness, and confidence in social situations (Extraversion).
