Conscientiousness: High  
Extraversion: Moderate 

Explanation:

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness throughout the different situations described, as they show responsibility in managing tasks requiring attention to detail (dental school projects), encouraging team spirit during low spirits (intramural basketball games), and taking initiative to act on impulses for work-related opportunities (proctoring SAT exams). These behaviors align with a conscientious personality trait. 

The level of extraversion is moderate as indicated by the individual's desire for enjoyable social gatherings, their laid-back nature, and preference for hanging out with friends during weekends. They seem comfortable in social settings but prioritize relaxing activities over overly outgoing behavior.

In summary:
- Conscientiousness: High due to the responsible actions taken in various tasks requiring attention to detail.
- Extraversion: Moderate based on the individual's enjoyment of social gatherings and relaxed personality style.
