Conscientiousness: 4.2 
Extraversion: 3.8 

The scores are based on the general pattern observed across all questions in relation to their respective factors:

1) Conscientiousness involves responsibility, dependability, self-discipline, and orderliness. The individual showed a high level of conscientiousness when they described themselves as 'open' and willing to reach for help, adapting quickly to new situations.

2) Extraversion involves sociability, energy, talkativeness, assertiveness. Although the individual was able to justify their decisions with calm and rational responses in many instances, there were some hints of extroversion when they were looking forward to social events or trying to liven up a situation at work.

In terms of Conscientiousness, the individual demonstrated strong traits like self-discipline ("pushed and pushed myself") and responsibility by managing their tasks efficiently ("paying attention to detail"). This indicates a high level of conscientiousness. However, they were also shown to have some weaknesses in this area as well when they struggled with understanding complex materials, suggesting that while generally responsible and disciplined, they could sometimes be overwhelmed.

For Extraversion, the individual seemed to enjoy social interactions ("loved going out after work"), but showed more introverted behaviors such as justifying their decisions by stating "I'm usually a calm person" or finding excuses not to attend events. This indicates that while they have some extroverted traits, they also show tendencies towards introversion.

Given these observations across all questions, I would rate the individual's Conscientiousness at around 4 and their Extraversion at about 3-4 on a scale from 1 to 5 (with higher numbers indicating stronger traits).
