Conscientiousness: 8/10 

The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and attention to detail in their work, especially when it comes to finances where accuracy is paramount. This trait manifests as they are meticulous about verifying and double-checking their work to avoid errors that could lead to significant issues later on.

Extraversion: 6/10 

The individual shows a level of sociability but with certain boundaries. They enjoy being around people, especially after spending time alone during the pandemic, indicating a preference for interaction. However, they also value private time and are content engaging in quiet activities at home, suggesting that while socializing is important to them, it's not their primary source of energy.

The individual balances these two traits effectively by prioritizing professional relationships at work but ensuring personal downtime for relaxation and recharging. This balance supports their ability to be both productive and well-rounded, contributing positively to their overall performance and well-being.
