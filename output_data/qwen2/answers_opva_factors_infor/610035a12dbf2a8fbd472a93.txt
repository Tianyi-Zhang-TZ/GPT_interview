Conscientiousness: 8/10  
Extraversion: 7/10

Explanation:

**Conscientiousness**: The individual is described as very detail-oriented, which aligns with a high score on this trait (8 out of 10). Their concern for perfection and the meticulous attention to details in their job, such as ensuring contracts are accurate and correctly aligned with project scopes, demonstrates strong conscientious behavior. Additionally, their proactive approach to checking work multiple times to avoid mistakes shows dedication to responsibility and reliability.

**Extraversion**: The individual's extroverted nature is evident through their leadership role during team spirit-building after a disappointing soccer game result (7 out of 10). Their ability to organize and enjoy social activities despite personal disappointment suggests they can balance self-expression with considering the feelings and needs of others. However, it could also indicate a slightly higher need for social interaction or external validation, as evidenced by their desire to gather friends immediately after an upsetting event.

Both traits highlight the individual's strengths in teamwork (Extraversion) and quality assurance (Conscientiousness), contributing positively to professional environments where collaboration and attention to detail are crucial.
