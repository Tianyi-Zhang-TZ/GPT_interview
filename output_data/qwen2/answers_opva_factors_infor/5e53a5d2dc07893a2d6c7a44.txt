Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 3.5 

The individual displays a high level of conscientiousness due to their strong attention to detail and tendency to ensure tasks are done correctly, as well as their willingness to take on responsibilities and push themselves in challenging situations. Their behavior indicates strong organizational skills and reliability, which are core aspects of the Conscientiousness factor.

However, the individual's self-disclosure about social events and their preference for maintaining boundaries between professional and personal life suggests a slightly more reserved or introverted nature. This is indicative of a lower score in Extraversion, although not as low as it might be expected given some questions may suggest otherwise due to their occasional desire to engage with coworkers socially. Their actions around raising team spirits and being willing to act impulsively when necessary hint at times when they do exhibit more extraverted behaviors.

Overall, the individual's scores are not at the extremes of either factor but tend towards a balanced personality that combines elements of both conscientiousness and extraversion. They show discipline, responsibility, and reliability while also expressing social tendencies that can lead to good team interaction, though with an inclination towards maintaining professional boundaries.
