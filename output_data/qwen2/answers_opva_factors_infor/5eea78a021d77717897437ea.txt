Conscientiousness: 8/10  
Extraversion: 6/10 

Explanation:

The individual demonstrates strong traits associated with high levels of Conscientiousness in their responses, as evidenced by their focus on details and planning, their role as a practical encourager for team members, and their thoughtful approach to decision-making. This indicates they are highly organized, disciplined, and reliable.

On the other hand, Extraversion shows a less pronounced pattern throughout the answers. The individual prefers solitary activities over social events after work or does not enjoy purely social gatherings without an underlying purpose. They also handle details by focusing on specific tasks at once rather than multitasking, which could suggest they might prefer to engage with information and tasks in depth when alone, thus aligning more closely with Extraversion's characteristics related to energy and enthusiasm.

The Conscientiousness rating is higher because the individual consistently shows behaviors that align with high levels of organization, attention to detail, responsibility, and determination. The Extraversion rating reflects a balance leaning towards being comfortable but not overly enthusiastic in social settings or impulsive actions.
