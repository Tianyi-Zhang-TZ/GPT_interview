4) They face challenges with fear of social interaction but try their best to push through these difficulties when presented with tasks or responsibilities.
5) They are diligent in checking work orders thoroughly and seek clarification from supervisors if necessary, showing attention to detail.

These behaviors suggest a high level of conscientiousness as they prioritize responsibility, organization, and effort toward fulfilling duties, albeit facing some social anxiety.

For Extraversion, the individual demonstrates traits like empathy towards colleagues' difficulties but chooses to remain in the background rather than leading during group discussions.
1) They tend to avoid after-work social events due to feelings of shyness or fear of being judged by others.
