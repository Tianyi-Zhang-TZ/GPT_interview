Extraversion: 6/10

While this person seems to value relationships with colleagues and feels the need for a safe environment where they can connect, indicating some level of extraversion in terms of valuing social interactions, their responses do not consistently display high levels of energy, assertiveness, or enthusiasm characteristic of an extraverted personality.
