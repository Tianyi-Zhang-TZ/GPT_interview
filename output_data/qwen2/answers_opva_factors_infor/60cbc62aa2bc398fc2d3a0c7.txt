Conscientiousness: 4/5

As someone who appears to value organization, planning and persistence, it seems like you exhibit many traits associated with high levels of conscientiousness. You are dedicated to tasks until they are completed, particularly when dealing with work that requires attention to detail. Your commitment to ensuring the accuracy of your work is a strong indicator of this trait. Additionally, despite potential challenges in paying close attention to details when not medicated for ADHD, you show resilience and determination by seeking assistance or finding solutions to overcome these difficulties. This ability to maintain focus on important tasks until completion suggests high conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3/5

While your interactions with colleagues seem friendly and social, there is a suggestion that you might have some reticence when engaging in social activities at work. The fact that workplace gossip questions the appropriateness of lunch outings with co-workers and the prevalence of reticence towards socializing with them suggests that your level of extraversion may not be very high. You appear to value personal connections, especially with colleagues who you can connect on a human level rather than gender lines. This preference for meaningful interactions over superficial ones might indicate an inclination towards introversion or at least a moderate level of extraversion.
