Conscientiousness: 4.3 
Extraversion: 3.7 

Explanation:

Based on the answers provided, it is clear that this individual demonstrates traits that align with both factors in HEXCO personality model but slightly more so towards Conscientiousness than Extraversion.

Regarding Conscientiousness:
The person consistently shows behaviors such as paying attention to details ("I get pretty. Hey pretty lady nervous working with money"), managing tasks diligently (fixing lane lines for the pool, analyzing school spending), and taking initiative in situations where others are hesitant or unwilling ("discrimination training discussion"). This indicates a high level of organization, responsibility, reliability, and goal-directed behavior.

Regarding Extraversion:
The person's answers also exhibit some traits related to extraversion by demonstrating social skills such as engaging with people ("I just try to ask them a lot of questions"), leading group discussions ("Until we die more registered Health leads discussion. I moved in certain areas."), and valuing team cohesion ("And yeah, I don't really want to go please somebody I put stuff over not to say, bye-bye"). However, these behaviors do not seem as consistent or strong compared to the traits related to Conscientiousness.

Therefore, when considering both questions that are specifically linked to Extraversion and a broader analysis of personality traits demonstrated throughout all questions:

Conscientiousness: The individual demonstrates high levels of responsibility, organization, self-control, dependability, and persistence in their behaviors. This indicates strong tendencies towards the Conscientiousness factor.
Extraversion: While also showing some social skills and assertiveness, these do not appear to be as pronounced or consistent compared to the traits aligned with Conscientiousness.

Hence, considering the overall ratings:

Conscientiousness: 4.3/5 (Highly conscientious)
Extraversion: 3.7/5 (Moderately extraverted)

These ratings reflect a personality that is primarily characterized by strong conscientious tendencies and moderately so in terms of extraversion, with potential for improvements or further development towards increasing the balance between these two traits.
