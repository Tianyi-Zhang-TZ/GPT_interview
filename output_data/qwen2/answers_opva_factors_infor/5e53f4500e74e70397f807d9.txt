Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 3.2 

Explanation:

The person demonstrates behaviors that align with both the Conscientiousness and Extraversion traits, though more strongly in the Conscientiousness domain.

Regarding Conscientiousness (ranging from 1 to 5):

- The person exhibits high attention to detail and orderliness, as evidenced by their organization skills at work and responsibility for cleaning up after themselves. This aligns with the conscientiousness factor.
- They show a strong commitment to tasks and responsibilities, which is another indicator of conscientiousness.
- Their proactive approach in skill acquisition (e.g., screenwriting course) also supports this trait.

On the Extraversion side (ranging from 1 to 5):

- The person acknowledges being shy or quiet when meeting new people initially but manages to open up and become comfortable with social interactions later on. This indicates that they are somewhat introverted, which would lower their score in extraversion.
- They demonstrate a social streak by participating in team discussions as a leader and sometimes organizing social events at work, contributing to the score.

Overall, the individual's high level of responsibility, attention to detail, and willingness to take on challenges aligns more closely with the Conscientiousness trait. Their adaptive nature in social settings suggests they have a certain level of extraversion but it is less dominant compared to their conscientious traits.
