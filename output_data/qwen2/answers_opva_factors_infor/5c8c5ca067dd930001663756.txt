Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 4.2

Explanation:

1. **Question 1**: This indicates strong self-awareness and strategic approach in social situations, which is generally associated with high Conscientiousness. However, the answer also reflects a certain level of assertiveness and willingness to engage in conversations, suggesting a moderate to high Extraversion.

2. **Question 2**: The strong emphasis on organization aligns well with high Conscientiousness, indicating responsibility, reliability, and a tendency towards orderliness. There's no direct reference to social settings or interactions, which typically point to Extraversion traits, making this question more indicative of Conscientiousness.

3. **Question 3**: This answer shows adaptability between leadership and listening roles depending on comfort levels and the nature of the discussion. While it leans towards being somewhat introverted due to preference for analysis and observation, it still involves social interaction which could indicate a moderate level of Extraversion.

4. **Question 4**: The strong motivation and determination when faced with challenges aligns well with high Conscientiousness, as this factor typically involves responsibility-taking and goal-directed behavior.

5. **Question 5**: This question highlights flexibility in decision-making based on mood which could indicate a moderate level of Extraversion due to the social aspect of engaging after work. The answer does not explicitly mention any traits related to organization or structure, suggesting less emphasis on Conscientiousness.

6. **Question 6**: High note-taking and double-checking are consistent with high levels of organization and attention to detail, which are associated with Conscientiousness. This suggests a high rating for this factor but implies little relevance to Extraversion based on the given context.

7. **Question 7**: The willingness to lift spirits through humor or positive energy is directly related to social interaction and can be seen as indicative of high Extraversion since it involves engaging with others in an uplifting manner. There's no explicit reference to organizational skills that would align with Conscientiousness.

8. **Question 8**: A strong desire to overcome obstacles, combined with a team-oriented approach when necessary, supports a high rating for both Conscientiousness (for persistence) and Extraversion (for working well in teams and potentially dealing with impulsive actions).

Given the above analysis, it's reasonable to assign:

- **Conscientiousness**: 4.5, because while there are traits that suggest moderate levels of organization, responsibility-taking and goal-directed behavior across most questions support this score.
  
- **Extraversion**: 4.2, due to the social nature shown in some answers (like engaging with others, making decisions based on mood), but it's slightly lower compared to Conscientiousness as not all traits directly align with high levels of extraversion.

The ratings are rounded off to maintain simplicity and readability while keeping within the specified scale range.
