Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.8

This person exhibits a relatively strong level of conscientiousness, which is indicated by their attention to detail, desire to maintain order and organization, willingness to help others when tasks are challenging or stressful, and preference for being thorough in their work rather than making mistakes. They also display some introverted characteristics, especially when engaging with new people or participating in social events outside of the workplace.

On the other hand, they show a somewhat lower level of extraversion compared to conscientiousness. This is reflected in their tendency towards shyness and preference for staying within their close group of friends rather than expanding social interactions beyond that circle. They also express a desire for separating work life from personal time, which might indicate a more reserved approach to socializing with colleagues after hours.
