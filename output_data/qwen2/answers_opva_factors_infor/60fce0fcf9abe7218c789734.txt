Conscientiousness: 3/5

Extraversion: 2/5

Explanation:

The individual shows a moderate level of Conscientiousness as they display traits such as being focused, detail-oriented, and motivated to boost morale in their team when necessary. However, there are instances where the person's anxiety and fear might affect their performance or decisions. In particular situations involving social events outside of work and trying to assert themselves at a higher level than peers, these behaviors suggest a somewhat lower degree of Conscientiousness as they seem hesitant and fearful.

Regarding Extraversion, the individual displays some aspects but not consistently throughout different contexts. They appear to be shy and intimidated in large groups or after-work social events, which points towards lower levels of extraversion. However, their role in managing morale by organizing treats for team members indicates a more extraverted trait when it comes to expressing care and appreciation in the workplace. Overall, this suggests a somewhat introverted personality with occasional extroverted tendencies.
