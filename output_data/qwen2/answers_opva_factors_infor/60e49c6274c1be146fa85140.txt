Conscientiousness: 4/5
Extraversion: 3/5

Explanation:

The provided text showcases traits related to both Conscientiousness and Extraversion, but there isn't a clear-cut distinction in the descriptions as they blend characteristics across these two personality factors. Here's how the ratings are determined based on the given information.

**Conscientiousness**: The text demonstrates behaviors that align with high levels of conscientiousness such as attention to detail (in handling yearly review reports), emotional resilience when under stress, and a tendency for thoroughness (revisiting work several times). These traits reflect organization, responsibility, and diligence. However, there is also a mention of being cautious not to act impulsively without considering consequences, which could be seen as more closely related to conscientiousness than to extraversion.

**Extraversion**: The text exhibits some characteristics of extraversion such as enjoying deeper relationships with colleagues and feeling nervous under pressure when performing tasks like overseeing a large project. These traits are generally associated with social engagement and energy levels in interpersonal interactions, but they do not dominate the descriptions given.

In summary:

- **Conscientiousness** is rated higher because it encompasses more of the detailed, responsible behaviors mentioned, such as meticulous attention to detail, resilience under stress, and careful consideration before acting.
  
- **Extraversion** gets a lower rating due to the balanced nature of the text's descriptions ¨C while there are signs of an interest in social relationships (enjoying deeper connections with colleagues), these traits are not as prominently featured as the conscientious behaviors.

This analysis reflects that the individual seems to be more inclined towards conscientious attributes, although they do engage in interpersonal activities and experience a certain level of energy.
