Conscientiousness: 3/5 

The provided answers indicate that this person is conscientious to some extent, as they appear organized and detail-oriented in certain situations (such as proofreading and organizing spreadsheets). They are able to complete tasks efficiently, which points towards a level of responsibility and reliability. However, their dislike for tedious details and not actively seeking opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities could suggest that they might sometimes prioritize efficiency over perfection or may lack assertiveness in promoting themselves.

Extraversion: 2/5 

The individual appears less extraverted as they describe preferring to stay away from work situations where they believe they will have to interact with people who are no longer part of their team. Their approach to cheering up colleagues during times of uncertainty indicates that they can empathize and engage socially, especially when it aligns with helping others or maintaining a positive atmosphere, but they do not seem to actively seek out social interaction as a primary motivator.

Justification:

The Conscientiousness rating is based on the individual's demonstrated ability to handle tasks requiring attention to detail effectively in certain situations. However, their apparent reluctance to pursue opportunities that require them to step forward and assert themselves suggests a more cautious nature which could potentially limit their advancement or productivity when it comes to self-promotion.

For Extraversion, while they do show empathy and social engagement during times of emotional distress among colleagues, there is no evidence suggesting an active desire for social interaction. Their preference to avoid certain work environments indicates that social stimulation does not significantly drive their performance or job satisfaction. Therefore, this suggests a relatively lower level of extraversion as it relates to seeking out and engaging in social activities spontaneously or without prompting.

Overall, these ratings suggest that the individual leans more towards introversion both personally and professionally and displays moderate levels of conscientiousness when considering organization, efficiency, and responsibility but might benefit from being slightly more proactive in certain areas.
