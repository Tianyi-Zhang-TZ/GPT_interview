Conscientiousness: 3  
Extraversion: 2 

Explanation:

The user's self-description suggests a mix of traits that align with the factors of Conscientiousness and Extraversion but leans more towards being conscientious than extraverted.

**Conscientiousness**: The user indicates feelings of responsibility, organization, and a desire for productivity. However, they also express struggles with time management and potential procrastination ("I feel that I'm missing out on time right now because I'm not doing anything"). This shows a moderate level of conscientiousness as they recognize the importance of efficiency but have difficulty maintaining it.

**Extraversion**: The user's thoughts about joining an after-work social event reveal some ambivalence and potential discomfort in social settings. They are somewhat interested yet also acknowledge feelings of awkwardness with coworkers outside work environments. This suggests a lower level of extraversion, as they might find more energy or enjoyment in solitary activities or smaller groups compared to larger gatherings.

Overall, while the user values productivity and organization (traits associated with high conscientiousness), their experiences with social situations suggest a preference for solitude, which aligns better with lower levels of extraversion.
