Conscientiousness: 9/10  
Extraversion: 7/10

The person described demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness, as seen in their detailed-oriented approach to fixing the computer and leading by example as a supervisor on the waterproofing crew. They show strong leadership skills by taking on difficult tasks themselves, which inspires and motivates others. These behaviors align with high levels of conscientiousness as they are careful, organized, responsible, goal-directed, persistent, self-disciplined, and reliable.

On the other hand, the person exhibits a somewhat lower level of extraversion compared to their conscientiousness. While they show leadership qualities that could be associated with extraversion (such as being willing to take on difficult tasks), they do not appear to have high levels of social assertiveness or energy for interacting with others, which are key components of extraversion. Their actions seem more focused on work-related tasks and outcomes rather than seeking out social interaction or stimulation.

The conscientiousness rating is given because the individual consistently demonstrates traits such as being detail-oriented in computer repairs, taking initiative as a supervisor, and being diligent about getting difficult jobs done. These traits are central to the factor of conscientiousness and are evident across multiple situations described.

The extraversion rating is lower due to less emphasis on social behaviors or seeking out interaction with others. The individual prioritizes task completion and leadership through example over personal social engagement or assertiveness in a work setting.
