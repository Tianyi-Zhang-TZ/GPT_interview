Conscientiousness: 8/10  
Extraversion: 6/10  

The individual exhibits a strong level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their attention to detail and preference for thoroughness in tasks. They value getting things done correctly the first time, demonstrating reliability and diligence. This is evident when building furniture with their father, where they insisted on careful reading of instructions and meticulous execution.

In terms of extraversion, the rating is slightly lower at a 6/10. While they do enjoy middle-of-the-day social events and push themselves to attend smaller group gatherings after school or work, there's an underlying hesitation when it comes to large groups or unfamiliar settings like parties. This suggests that while they may not be extremely introverted, their energy might wane in larger social environments, and they prefer a more controlled setting where they can make new friends.

The combination of high conscientiousness and moderate extraversion highlights the individual's ability to focus on details and execute tasks methodically while maintaining some level of sociability. The conscientious nature helps them manage responsibilities effectively, whereas the extraversion allows for social engagement within their comfort zone.
