Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 3.5 

The person appears to display a generally strong level of conscientiousness, as indicated by their attention to details, organization skills (putting things back in place), willingness to take on challenging tasks, and the desire for self-improvement through pushing oneself (pushing hundred push-ups). Their response regarding the after-work social event also suggests they might sometimes struggle with balancing work commitments against personal desires or responsibilities towards family.

On the other hand, their extraversion seems slightly lower compared to conscientiousness. The person appears to feel more comfortable in solitary settings ("Open settings and no energy") and prefers to engage more passively rather than lead group discussions ("I like to"). While they can be motivated to take action when needed (such as trying to finish push-ups), there's a hint of impulsivity or lack of self-restraint at times ("Is finishes work for checking in after that as some self-restraint").

This suggests the personality profile leans towards being more conscientious than extraverted, with a moderate level of both traits.
