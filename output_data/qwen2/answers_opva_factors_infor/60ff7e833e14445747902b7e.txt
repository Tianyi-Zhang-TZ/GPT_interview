Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5 

Explanation: Based on the provided answers, it appears that the individual is quite conscientious in their approach to tasks and responsibilities. This can be seen from their focus on organizing things efficiently (Question 2), maintaining attention to detail (Question 6) and decision-making when faced with challenges or difficulties (Questions 4 and 8). They seem to handle responsibility well, which contributes towards a high score for Conscientiousness.

In terms of Extraversion, the individual appears to be somewhat outgoing but not overly so. This is evident from their participation in social settings at times without feeling entirely comfortable (Question 1), showing some level of discomfort in authority situations (Question 3) and generally maintaining composure even when faced with challenging tasks or situations (Questions 4 and 8). 

The score for Extraversion isn't significantly high because they seem to be more focused on the task at hand rather than social interactions. This might suggest that while not necessarily introverted, their main focus is often on accomplishing objectives rather than engaging in social activities.

Therefore, considering their overall behavior towards responsibilities and tasks vs. their level of comfort with social settings and activities, we arrive at these ratings for Conscientiousness and Extraversion respectively.
