Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.8

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated higher because the individual shows traits like organization, being detail-oriented, and making sound judgments before acting which aligns with this trait.

Extraversion receives a lower rating as while they enjoy social settings when known individuals are present, they also show signs of introversion in unfamiliar settings or when needing alone time. This dual nature suggests their extraversion isn't consistently high across all situations.
