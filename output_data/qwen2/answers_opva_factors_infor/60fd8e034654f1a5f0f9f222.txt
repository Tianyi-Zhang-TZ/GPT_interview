Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 3.8 

Explanation:

The person seems to exhibit high levels of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their organized and detail-oriented nature when dealing with equipment usage at work, willingness to improve social skills in challenging situations, attention to detail in demanding tasks, and proactive approach towards solving problems.

Regarding extraversion, the individual appears somewhat introverted or reserved compared to what one might expect from an extrovert. They seem self-conscious about their social dynamics (Question 1), are more inwardly focused when using equipment at work (Question 2), tend to listen rather than lead in discussions (Question 3), and are careful not to act impulsively even though they might want something badly (Question 8). However, they also show a desire for social interaction through attending college events (Question 1) and engaging with coworkers during after-work social events (Question 5).

The overall scores suggest that the person leans more towards being conscientious than extraverted, although there are indications of social engagement which could be considered as a moderate level of extraversion in certain contexts.
