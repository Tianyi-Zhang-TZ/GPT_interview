Conscientiousness: 4.2  
Extraversion: 3.8  

The Conscientiousness score is rated as a bit higher because the answers indicate strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and a tendency towards responsibility and self-discipline. The individual mentions being strategic, very organized, clean, OCD-like traits in terms of organization, and always finishing what they start, which are all indicators of high Conscientiousness.

The Extraversion score is rated as slightly lower because the responses mostly show more introverted or reserved behaviors such as getting comfortable with surroundings before interacting, shyness at social events, preferring a listening role over leading roles initially, and not pushing for social events that don't align with personal obligations. The individual also mentions enjoying social events but only when they involve responsibilities (like ensuring colleagues have time off), which suggests some level of introversion.
