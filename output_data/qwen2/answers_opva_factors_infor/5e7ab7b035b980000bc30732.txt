Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.8 

The Conscientiousness score is based on traits like attention to detail, responsibility, and orderliness, which are evident in the answers given. For instance, the person mentions being conservative about putting things away neatly at work (Question 2), wanting to make sure everything turns out well when paying attention to details (Question 6), and showing leadership qualities when their team members were feeling down (Question 7). These behaviors reflect conscientiousness.

The Extraversion score is based on social interaction skills, sociability, and assertiveness. The person enjoys after-work social events, engages with friends and like-minded people for discussions about various interests, shows a natural outgoing nature by approaching strangers to invite them to events (Question 5), and takes initiative in guiding others when running a street team (Question 7). These behaviors indicate high levels of extraversion.

The scores are not perfectly balanced because the person appears more introverted or reserved compared to how some people might perceive an average score, considering their hesitation in making spontaneous decisions at work (Question 8) and being apprehensive about taking risks. At the same time, they also display strong responsible tendencies which lean towards a higher conscientiousness rating than extraversion.

Please note that individual personality can vary widely from these scores and this is just an average estimation based on the given answers.
