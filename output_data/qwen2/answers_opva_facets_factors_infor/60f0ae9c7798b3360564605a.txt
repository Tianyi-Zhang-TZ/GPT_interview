Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 2/5 

The Conscientiousness score reflects a strong level of diligence and responsibility, with traits such as paying attention to details in order to avoid mistakes (Perfectionism) and making decisions that align with personal values (Sociability). However, the score could be slightly higher if the individual demonstrated more proactive behaviors, such as engaging in the after-work social event despite their introversion.

The Extraversion score is lower due to the person's inclination towards solitude and introversion. They prefer staying alone rather than joining an after-work social event or being around others for extended periods of time (Sociability). While this trait can lead to personal contentment, it also limits engagement with external activities which may be important in some professional environments.

Overall, these scores suggest that the individual tends to be dependable and focused on tasks at hand but might require more encouragement to step out of their comfort zone.
