Conscientiousness: 7/10  
Extraversion: 6/10  

The given text describes a person who appears to have traits that are somewhat split across Conscientiousness and Extraversion scales, but with a predominant theme of cautiousness or prudence intertwined. The individual mentions being 'big picture' oriented which aligns more closely with the Conscientiousness trait as it involves planning ahead and considering implications before making decisions (10/10). However, when discussing their approach to helping team members and their hesitation in voicing praise, this reflects a somewhat lower level of extraversion or sociability, as they prefer internalizing emotions and thoughts rather than openly expressing them. They tend to be careful and deliberate which points towards high prudence (7/10), particularly evident when deciding on work-related decisions.

Conscientiousness: 
The individual's attention to the big picture and their ability to organize things efficiently suggests a strong inclination towards this trait, indicating they are responsible and methodical in their approach. They are likely detail-oriented but prioritize outcomes over minutiae which could imply that they're somewhat selective about focusing on details based on their perceived importance.

Extraversion: 
Despite their 'big picture' orientation, the individual's reluctance to express praise or engage in spontaneous actions is indicative of a lower level of extraversion. They seem to be more introspective and reserved when it comes to social interactions and decision-making that involves immediate action without much forethought.

Prudence:
The prudence aspect appears prominently in their cautiousness towards both personal decisions (impulse spending) and work-related choices, showing an inclination towards careful thought processes and avoidance of risk-taking. This trait is evident through their methodical approach in finding a job, indicating they are careful in assessing all available options before proceeding.

Overall, while the individual displays traits that align with conscientiousness due to their organizational skills and planning abilities, they show less extraversion particularly when it comes to expressing themselves or engaging impulsively. Their prudence manifests through a preference for cautious decision-making across personal spending and work-related choices.
