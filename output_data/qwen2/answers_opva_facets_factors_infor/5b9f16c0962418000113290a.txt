Conscientiousness: 4.3
Extraversion: 3.8

Explanation:

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their strong organizational skills, attention to detail, diligence in challenging situations, and commitment towards personal values like fairness and empathy. They are responsible for managing the company's newsletter with an emphasis on accuracy, show concern about team members' well-being, and maintain dedication even when facing adversity or unfair treatment at work.

On the other hand, their extraversion score suggests they have a moderate inclination towards social settings but can feel uncomfortable in unfamiliar environments initially. Their introverted nature becomes apparent when attending new events like yoga classes, yet they manage to overcome this by being open-minded and friendly. They are selective about joining after-work social events due to feeling reserved.

Overall ratings are given based on the cumulative traits shown across all questions within their descriptions:
- Conscientiousness: 4.3 out of 5 because they exhibit strong responsibility, organization, diligence, attention to detail, empathy, and fairness towards others.
- Extraversion: 3.8 out of 5 due to a moderate social inclination with the ability to overcome initial discomfort in unfamiliar settings but chooses selective social engagements based on comfort levels.

The ratings reflect a balanced personality that combines high levels of conscientiousness (diligence, responsibility) and moderate extraversion (social engagement with some reservations).
