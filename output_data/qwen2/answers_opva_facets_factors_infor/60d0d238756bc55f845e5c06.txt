Conscientiousness: 5
Extraversion: 3

The individual described exhibits a high level of conscientiousness, which is evident in their meticulous attention to detail when assembling items such as furniture and their proactive approach towards ensuring the well-being of their team after hearing about the tragic loss of another team member's child. This trait can be seen in their carefulness and dedication to tasks requiring precision and thoroughness.

On the other hand, their extraversion level seems to fluctuate based on different situations. In scenarios where they are required to perform tasks with a high degree of focus and patience (e.g., assembling furniture), their level of extraversion might appear lower as they seem to be in a 'happy-go-lucky' state or even overly cautious. However, when faced with the personal goal of achieving a sales target during work hours, this same individual can exhibit more aggressive behavior, indicating that under certain conditions and motivations (like the desire for personal achievement), their extraversion can increase.

Overall, while they maintain a generally conscientious nature across most situations, their level of extraversion seems to be influenced by external factors such as task requirements or personal objectives.
