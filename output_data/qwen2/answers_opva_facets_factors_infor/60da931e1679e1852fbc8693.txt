Conscientiousness: 4.2 
Extraversion: 3.8 

Explanation:

The individual exhibits high levels of conscientiousness, primarily due to their responsibility in organizing and maintaining order (Question 2), attention to detail when avoiding mistakes (Question 6), and willingness to help raise the spirits of others (Question 7). They also demonstrate a preference for being alone and enjoy introverted activities, suggesting some level of introspection which aligns with conscientious traits.

Regarding extraversion, the individual acknowledges their introverted nature, enjoying alone time and having tendencies towards shyness in social situations. However, they do show willingness to engage as leaders when comfortable (Question 3) and make decisions based on personal interests rather than impulsivity or lack of engagement (Question 4 & Question 8). 

The overall conscientiousness score is slightly higher due to the consistent display of responsibility and organization across multiple scenarios. The extraversion score is lower because although they can engage in leadership roles when comfortable, their self-reported preference for alone time leans towards a more reserved personality type.

Please note that while this analysis attempts to provide broad insights based on the given information, individual personality assessment requires detailed observations over extended periods or through standardized psychological testing procedures.
