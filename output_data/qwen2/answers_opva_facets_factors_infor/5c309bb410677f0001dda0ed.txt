- Sociability (Question 5): 3. They adapt their social behavior depending on the setting but have shown reluctance towards after-work events that involve drinking, suggesting a somewhat introverted nature in certain contexts.
- Perfectionism (Question 6): 4. The individual focuses deeply on details to avoid mistakes, indicating a high level of conscientiousness concerning accuracy and quality.
- Liveliness (Question 7): Not rated as the answer does not provide enough information about the individual's behavior or personality in this context.
- Prudence (Question 8): Not rated for the same reason as above.

Extraversion (ranging from 1 to 5):
- Social self-esteem (Question 1): N/A due to lack of information on their social engagement style in this situation. However, there is no indication they are overly extraverted.
- Organization (Question 2): Not rated because the behavior described does not necessarily relate to their personality traits but rather a practical action at work.
- Social boldness (Question 3): The individual's approach has become more collaborative and less assertive over time suggests somewhat introverted tendencies despite having led in some situations.
- Diligence (Question 4): Not directly rated as it concerns work ethics, not their personality traits. However, the preference for challenging tasks might suggest a moderate level of extraversion due to the excitement or interest involved.
- Sociability (Question 5): Low to medium given their reluctance towards certain social settings involving alcohol but adaptability to different situations suggests some level of being outgoing when necessary.
- Perfectionism (Question 6): Not rated because perfectionism isn't directly related to extraversion. However, the focus on details could imply a somewhat introverted approach in focusing deeply on tasks.
- Liveliness (Question 7): The lack of information precludes rating this trait as it involves the ability to raise spirits which is typically associated with extraversion.
- Prudence (Question 8): This trait deals with restraint and planning, suggesting that while the individual was cautious about their application process, they might not necessarily display high levels of extraversion based on the limited information provided.

Overall ratings:
Conscientiousness: The individual demonstrates a strong work ethic, organization skills, and attention to detail. They are proactive in social situations but adaptable in different settings.
Extraversion: While the individual shows some level of introversion in certain contexts (avoiding alcohol-related events), they can adapt their behavior depending on the situation which suggests moderate levels of extraversion rather than being particularly extroverted or introverted.
