Conscientiousness: 4.5  
Extraversion: 3.2

Explanation:

Conscientiousness (ranging from 1.0 to 5.0):
The individual demonstrated strong organization and planning skills as evidenced by the way they handled equipment at work and contributed to team discussions with a cooperative and thoughtful approach. This is indicative of high conscientiousness.
However, there was also mention of stubbornly finishing tasks when assigned, which could be seen as both positive (demonstrating diligence) but might not align perfectly with the definition of conscientiousness as being primarily about organization and responsibility. Still, this trait leans more towards a higher rating in this scale due to the overall pattern observed.
Sociability also seemed high given their preference for social events after work and their ability to maintain positive relationships at the workplace.

Extraversion (ranging from 1.0 to 5.0):
The individual showed some extroverted traits by being open to joining after-work social events, enjoying socializing with colleagues, and maintaining a sense of liveliness when challenging situations arose. Their comments about needing personal connections outside of the workplace also hint at having an outgoing nature.
However, there were no explicit examples provided that would push this rating into higher territory (4-5). The individual did not showcase high levels of enthusiasm for social activities or impulsive behavior.

Overall, considering these factors, I would rate conscientiousness slightly above average due to the strong organizational skills and diligent approach when required. The extraversion score is placed around moderate since while they are open to social events, their responses do not indicate a particularly outgoing personality.
