Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.8

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated at 4.5 because the individual displays traits such as organization, attention to detail, diligence in pursuing tasks, and consideration for others' feelings. They show a strong work ethic and responsibility towards their projects, which aligns with high conscientiousness.

Extraversion is rated at 3.8 due to mixed responses regarding social behavior. The individual enjoys after-work events and seeks out opportunities to connect with colleagues outside of the workplace, showing an inclination towards extraversion. However, they are also selective in their approach when it comes to raising team spirits or acting on impulses, which suggests a somewhat reserved side that may not always seek to engage socially.

These ratings are based on the provided scenarios where the individual demonstrates both strong personal accountability and responsibility (conscientiousness) as well as preferences for social connection but with a measured level of assertiveness (extraversion).
