Conscientiousness: 4.5  
Extraversion: 3.0  

The individual demonstrates a high level of responsibility, organization, diligence and perfectionism which aligns with a higher score on Conscientiousness (ranging from 1 being low to 5 being high). They also show some elements of introversion such as preferring solitude or quiet environments over social settings when comfortable, but this isn't consistent across all situations. Therefore, their score for Extraversion is slightly lower than average.

Justifications:

1) Conscientiousness: The individual consistently shows attention to detail and meticulous work habits which are reflective of the high Conscientiousness traits.
2) Perfectionism in task execution suggests that they strive for excellence, aligning with a strong sense of responsibility towards their tasks. Their tendency to double-check their work also highlights this trait.
3) Being reserved or not acting on impulses shows reliability and self-control, which are both part of the Conscientiousness traits.

1) Extraversion: While the individual displays some social skills (such as being laid-back when comfortable with colleagues), they seem more inclined towards introspection or personal space than engaging in constant social activities. This is indicative of a lower score on Extraversion.
2) Their choice to stay focused and composed in work-related decisions, rather than acting impulsively, suggests they prioritize thoughtful reflection over spontaneous action, which isn't typically associated with high levels of extraversion.

Overall, the individual's traits demonstrate a balanced personality leaning towards responsibility and self-control (high Conscientiousness), with some introverted tendencies that moderate their social interactions (lower Extraversion).
