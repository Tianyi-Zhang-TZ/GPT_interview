Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5  

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated as a relatively strong trait based on the provided examples. In tasks that require attention to detail (Question 6) and avoiding mistakes, the individual demonstrated meticulousness by writing down every detail they considered important. This indicates a high level of conscientiousness since it suggests that they are diligent, organized, and thorough in their work.

However, when interacting with others or being sociable (Question 1), the individual seems less inclined to engage actively or step out of their comfort zone. This suggests a lower degree of extraversion compared to individuals who might thrive on social interactions and networking.

Overall, the Conscientiousness score is higher due to the consistently diligent approach in tasks requiring focus and attention to detail across various scenarios. On the other hand, the Extraversion score is lower because the individual appears more reserved when it comes to interacting with others or stepping out of their comfort zone for social interactions.
