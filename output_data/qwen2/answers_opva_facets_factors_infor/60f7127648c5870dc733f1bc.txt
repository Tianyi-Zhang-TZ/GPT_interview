Their answers also hint at a preference for solitude or focusing on tasks rather than seeking out group activities or initiating conversations.

Prudence, which reflects self-control and restraint in impulse-based actions, is indicated by the person's decision to not act on an immediate desire for additional payment from a regular cab fare customer (Prudence: moderate).
