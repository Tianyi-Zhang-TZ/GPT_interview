Conscientiousness: 4.3  
Extraversion: 3.7 

The scores are based on the provided answers to questions that reflect personality traits within the HEXACO model.

**Conscientiousness** is rated high, primarily due to behaviors indicating strong organization (Question 2), diligence in tackling challenging tasks (Question 4), attention to detail (Question 6), and the ability to maintain a positive atmosphere for team members when they are feeling down (Question 7).

**Extraversion** shows moderate levels based on the tendency to force conversation when uncomfortable with peers at social events (Question 1), attending after-work social events despite initial reluctance, enjoying seeing people outside of work settings, and using humor as a method for lifting spirits (Question 5 & Question 8). The rating is not high because the answers do not strongly indicate an outgoing or engaging personality in all circumstances.

These ratings are based on the given information and assumptions about how each question relates to specific facets within the HEXACO model.
