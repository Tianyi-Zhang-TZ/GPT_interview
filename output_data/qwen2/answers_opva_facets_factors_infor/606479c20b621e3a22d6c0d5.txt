Conscientiousness: 8
Extraversion: 3

Explanation:

The Conscientiousness scale evaluates traits related to organization, diligence, responsibility, and achievement orientation. Based on the descriptions given in response to questions about paying attention to details (perfectionism), trying to raise spirits during team members' low morale (liveliness), wanting something badly at work (impulsivity), and avoiding social events with a preference for staying to oneself (sociability), it's clear that the individual displays strong conscientious traits.

The individual appears highly detail-oriented, meticulous in their work, which suggests a high level of conscientiousness. They also tend to provide praise to others and attempt to uplift spirits during challenging times at work, indicating they are thoughtful and considerate towards colleagues¡ªtraits commonly associated with the Conscientious personality type. The fact that they are cautious about impulses and prefer to plan and organize their actions might also point towards a high conscientiousness score.

In contrast, the Extraversion scale evaluates traits related to sociability, energy, assertiveness, and emotionality. Given that they express discomfort in social events with work colleagues (sociability), hesitate to join after-work gatherings even when invited (sociability), and find it challenging to interact with people outside of professional settings, their scores on the Extraversion scale are likely low.

While these responses suggest a strong conscientiousness trait, leading to an overall rating of 8 for Conscientiousness. The lower ratings in Extraversion reflect their preference for solitude or more introverted behavior patterns compared to those who might engage more energetically and socially in similar situations.
