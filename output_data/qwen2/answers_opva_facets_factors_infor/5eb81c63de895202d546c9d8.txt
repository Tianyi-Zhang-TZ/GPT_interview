Extraversion: 3/5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness reflects an individual's level of responsibility, organization, and attention to detail. Based on the provided text, it's evident that the person is highly conscientious. They demonstrate a strong commitment to customer satisfaction by avoiding mistakes in their work process to prevent complaints or negative impacts on customers. When making a mistake, they are proactive about rectifying issues rather than ignoring them or hoping for the best. Their approach to detail and their willingness to manage tasks effectively when energy levels are high indicate a high level of conscientiousness.

Extraversion reflects an individual's preference for social interaction versus solitary activities. The person described appears somewhat introverted, as they mention not enjoying diving into details and preferring to focus on the big picture. This is indicated by their reluctance to get "down into the weeds" when dealing with tasks that require more attention to detail. They seem more comfortable leading a team during challenging times rather than sharing personal experiences openly or expressing strong emotions about work situations.

In conclusion, this person exhibits high levels of conscientiousness due to their diligent nature and meticulous approach to work while showing moderate levels of extraversion because they prefer working independently and may not display an abundance of extroverted characteristics.
