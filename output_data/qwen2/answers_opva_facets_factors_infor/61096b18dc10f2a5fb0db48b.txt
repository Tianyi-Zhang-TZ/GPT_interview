Conscientiousness: 4.2  
Extraversion: 3.5  

**Explanation:**

- **Conscientiousness**: The person shows a high level of organization, diligence, and attention to detail (facets like Organization, Diligence, Perfectionism). They are also capable of managing their personal boundaries with work relationships and demonstrating liveliness in smaller group settings (Social boldness, Sociability, Liveliness). This combination indicates strong commitment and reliability. However, the lack of enthusiasm towards after-work social events suggests they may not be as driven by social interactions or may prefer to keep a professional distance from work relationships.

- **Extraversion**: The individual demonstrates some level of sociability in their professional environment but tends to maintain clear boundaries between their personal and professional lives. They are capable of engaging socially within the workplace when necessary (Social boldness, Sociability). However, they seem more introverted or reserved outside of work settings and might find it challenging to act on impulses related to work situations that involve personal desires or ambitions.

**Overall**, these scores suggest a conscientious personality who values organization, diligence, attention to detail, and is capable of maintaining a professional demeanor. The extraversion score indicates they are relatively private and can be introverted in social settings outside their immediate work environment.
