Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.8

Explanation:

The Conscientiousness score is based on traits like organization, diligence, and social boldness (Question 2, Question 4, and Question 5). The individual appears to prioritize order and efficiency, demonstrates strong leadership capabilities in group settings, and shows a practical approach when faced with challenging tasks. These behaviors align well with high conscientiousness, hence the rating of 4.2.

The Extraversion score considers traits related to sociability, liveliness, and perhaps impulsiveness (Question 5, Question 7, and Question 8). While the individual values social connections at work and enjoys participating in events, they also tend towards empathy and are willing to help others when needed. The mix of these behaviors suggests a moderate level of extraversion, hence the rating of 3.8.

The overall ratings consider the range provided for each question while ensuring that traits related to both personality dimensions are appropriately weighted in determining the final score.
