Conscientiousness: 4.0  
Extraversion: 3.5  

The individual exhibits a high level of responsibility and organization, which is evident in their responses to questions related to social settings (Social self-esteem) and tasks requiring attention to detail (Perfectionism). Their answers also demonstrate a strong inclination towards diligence and hard work (Diligence), suggesting that they are likely to put effort into tasks and not shy away from challenging situations. However, the individual's reluctance to join after-work social events when feeling burnt out or tired indicates a somewhat introverted side to their personality, which affects their level of sociability (Sociability). While they can engage in conversations and seem relatively comfortable holding discussions, their preference for avoiding activities that may be draining suggests a moderate level of extraversion. Their responses do not strongly align with the facets of Social boldness or Liveliness, as seen by their tendency to stay cautious and not act on impulse (Prudence).
