Conscientiousness: 4.5 

The individual demonstrates strong organizational skills, diligence in facing challenging tasks, and perfectionism when attention to detail is required at work. This indicates a high level of conscientiousness as they are self-disciplined, hardworking, and meticulous about their responsibilities.

Extraversion: 3

While the person shows some social traits like being helpful during team member down times (liveliness) and potentially trying to raise spirits or be there for coworkers who are feeling low, this is not consistent across all scenarios. They tend to exhibit more introverted characteristics such as focusing on work tasks and sometimes needing recharge time after work activities, which indicates they have a moderate level of extraversion.
