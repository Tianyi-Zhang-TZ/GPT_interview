Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness refers to traits like responsibility, organization, self-discipline, and reliability which are reflected in the answers provided. The individual consistently demonstrates diligence, paying attention to detail, being friendly and sociable, helping others when they're feeling down, and maintaining a positive attitude towards work tasks that require perfectionism.

However, there might be room for improvement as indicated by their tendency to focus on after-work social events which might distract them from their responsibilities or the uncertainty of how attending these could negatively impact their professional reputation. This suggests some conscientiousness may not always shine through in every situation, hence a rating slightly below 5/5.

The Extraversion scale reflects one's energy levels and preference for social interaction. The individual appears to be friendly, outgoing and enjoys networking events at work, as well as being enthusiastic when helping team members feeling down. This is indicative of an Extraverted personality type.

However, the answers do not provide clear signs of over-excitability or a need for constant social stimulation, which could suggest a more balanced level of extraversion compared to those who may lean heavily towards this trait. The individual's responses also indicate they might sometimes feel pressured by others' expectations when it comes to attending after-work events. Thus, the rating is slightly below 5/5.

In conclusion, while this person shows signs of strong conscientiousness and some elements of extraversion in certain contexts, there are nuances that suggest these traits might not be uniformly expressed across all situations or aspects of their life.
