Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

Justification:

Conscientiousness involves aspects like organization, diligence, and responsibility. The individual appears to score highly in organization, as seen from their preference for keeping work areas clean after completing tasks, which aligns with the conscientious personality trait. They also show a strong inclination towards diligence since they are willing to ask for help or assistance when necessary, demonstrating a proactive attitude towards challenges.

Regarding social self-esteem (Question 1), despite being described as an introvert, this person can still express their opinions and assert themselves in group discussions, which indicates a certain level of confidence in those contexts. However, this confidence might not extend to larger social gatherings where they feel uncomfortable. 

Sociability is also somewhat high (Question 5) since there's willingness to attend after-work events for networking purposes.

Perfectionism (Question 6) and Liveliness are low because the individual tends to avoid mistakes through careful attention rather than a trait indicating spontaneity or enthusiasm, which would align with higher levels of extraversion.

The level of prudence (Question 8) is uncertain as there's no clear indication from the answer on whether they act impulsively or think things through before acting. 

Diligence and organization are high because these traits are evident in how the person handles challenges at work, while extraversion is lower due to their preference for being introverted most of the time.

In conclusion, Conscientiousness receives a 4.0 rating reflecting their proactive behavior towards tasks and responsibilities whereas Extraversion gets a 2.5 rating reflecting their introverted nature in social settings but capable of assertive behaviors when necessary.
