Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Medium 

Explanation:

The individual described is characterized by a high level of conscientiousness, which manifests in their diligence, attention to detail, and care for others' spirits at work. They show responsibility through accepting after-work social events to get to know coworkers better, indicating they are reliable and goal-oriented. This facet's rating is high because the person consistently demonstrates qualities such as organization, efficiency, dependability, and self-discipline.

In terms of extraversion, their personality leans more towards being an introverted extrovert rather than a traditional extrovert. They derive energy from social situations but can also be reserved in new settings or with unfamiliar people. This means they might not always engage in impulse actions due to their need for reflection and planning. Their rating reflects this balance between recharging through solitude and seeking connection during communal activities.

The combination of high conscientiousness and medium extraversion results in an individual who is both driven and thoughtful, balancing the need for personal space with the importance of interpersonal relationships at work.
