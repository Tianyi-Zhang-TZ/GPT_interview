Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Moderately High

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is demonstrated through traits such as diligence, organization, and dependability. The individual in this context exhibits a strong sense of diligence when deciding whether to join an after-work social event or skip it. They prioritize their relationships with others, indicating a high level of conscientiousness.

Extraversion is characterized by sociability, assertiveness, and excitement seeking behaviors. The individual enjoys participating in after-work events and values human interaction. This willingness to engage socially suggests they have a moderately high level of extraversion, as they prefer being around people and enjoy social activities.

The combination of high conscientiousness and moderate-high extraversion suggests that this person is both diligent about their responsibilities but also enjoys social interactions, which allows them to balance their professional tasks with personal relationships effectively.
