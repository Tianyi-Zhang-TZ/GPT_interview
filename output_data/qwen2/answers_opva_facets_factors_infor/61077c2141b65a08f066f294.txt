Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness:
- Social self-esteem (Question 1) aligns with a strong sense of responsibility and organization, which is typically linked to high conscientiousness scores.
- Organization (Question 2) shows the individual's ability to manage tasks efficiently, also related to high conscientiousness levels. 
- Diligence (Question 4) reflects persistence in challenging situations, which supports the score for conscientiousness as well.
- Perfectionism (Question 6) is a hallmark of conscientious behavior where attention to detail and striving for accuracy are important qualities.

Extraversion:
- Social boldness (Question 3) might suggest some level of social engagement but not too high due to the preference for staying in the background when necessary.
- Sociability (Question 5) leans towards introversion since the person tends to avoid after-work social events, which is indicative of lower levels of extraversion.

Overall ratings are determined by considering multiple questions and facets related to each personality trait. The scores reflect a balanced yet slightly more dominant conscientiousness with a slight inclination towards introversion based on provided answers.
