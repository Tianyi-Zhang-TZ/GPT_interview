Conscientiousness: 7  
Extraversion: 4 

This individual exhibits a high level of conscientiousness, demonstrated by their focus on details and perfectionism when necessary, as well as their thoughtfulness in maintaining social harmony without compromising personal values. Their decision to raise spirits during a team meeting shows a concern for interpersonal relationships and a willingness to contribute positively to the environment.

However, they show moderate levels of extraversion. While they are not ashamed or embarrassed about their choices regarding alcohol consumption, they tend to be cautious about ordering non-alcoholic drinks in social settings where others might inquire about their decision. This suggests they might prefer quiet observation over active participation and might sometimes find social environments overwhelming. 

The prudence shown in managing company expenses by considering the potential consequences before making an impulse purchase indicates a level of thoughtfulness and responsibility that aligns with higher extraversion, as it requires self-control to weigh the impact on one's personal finances versus organizational policies.

In summary, this individual has high conscientiousness due to their attention to detail, perfectionism, and thoughtful social behavior. Their moderate level of extraversion is reflected in their approachability while still maintaining a sense of privacy about personal choices like alcohol consumption and managing company resources with care and responsibility.
