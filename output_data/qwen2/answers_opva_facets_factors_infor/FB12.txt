Conscientiousness: 4.3  
Extraversion: 3.5  

Explanation:

Conscientiousness involves traits like organization, diligence, and responsibility, while Extraversion is about sociability, emotional expressiveness, and energy level.

For Conscientiousness:
- **Organization**: The individual appears very organized based on their willingness to clean up after themselves and ensure everything's in place.
- **Diligence**: There are indications of high diligence as they don't shy away from challenging tasks but rather tackle them with a positive attitude, despite feeling the pressure.
- **Responsibility**: They show responsibility by not passing on difficult tasks and taking pride in their work.

For Extraversion:
- **Sociability**: The person seems somewhat introverted or uncomfortable in social settings which suggests lower levels of extraversion.
