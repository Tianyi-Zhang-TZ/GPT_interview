Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.5

Explanation:

Based on the provided answers, the person exhibits a strong sense of responsibility and organization (high Conscientiousness), which is reflected in their ability to clean up after events, put things back in place, and manage tasks efficiently.

Regarding Social boldness (related to leading versus listening roles), they appear to be adaptable and willing to take on both roles depending on the situation and their level of expertise. This flexibility suggests a moderate Extraversion as it involves interacting with others in different social situations.

The person also displays diligence in challenging situations, which is another aspect of high Conscientiousness. However, they are thoughtful about whether to push themselves further or not, suggesting some Prudence (a dimension related to Extraversion) as well since this implies they're considering their limits and resources before acting impulsively.

In terms of Sociability, the person seems open to social events when it aligns with their interests and commitments. This suggests moderate levels of Extraversion because they are willing to engage in social activities but also consider personal priorities.

Perfectionism is evident through a focus on detail management in their work tasks, which again points towards high Conscientiousness.

Liveliness was not mentioned directly but can be inferred from the person's ability to recognize and manage conflict and stress among team members. This indicates moderate levels of Extraversion as it involves empathetic and supportive behavior.

Prudence comes into play through the person's strategic approach in wanting to move up in their career, considering teamwork, motivation, and technical skills before acting on impulses.

Overall, this person shows a strong work ethic and responsibility with some social engagement but might be more reserved or cautious than someone who scores higher on Extraversion.
