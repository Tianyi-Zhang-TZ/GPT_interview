- Sociability: The reluctance to attend after-work social events is an indicator of low extraversion.

- Perfectionism: While perfectionism doesn't necessarily imply low or high extraversion, it shows introverted behaviors in focusing on details and precision over interaction.

- Liveliness: The ability to consider others' moods suggests some level of emotional engagement that might require more energy from a highly extraverted person.

- Prudence: This trait requires careful consideration before acting impulsively, which aligns with the need for introverted reflection and planning in decision-making rather than spontaneous action characteristic of extraversion.
