Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Medium 

Explanation:

The individual demonstrates high conscientiousness, as shown by their preference for taking time to ensure tasks are done correctly and effectively avoiding mistakes through paying close attention to details. This trait is also evident in their proactive approach towards building relationships with co-workers, which could contribute positively to workplace dynamics and productivity.

In terms of extraversion, the person appears to have a moderate score, as they express hesitation in social situations where they may feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable. They push themselves out of this comfort zone for smaller group events but find large gatherings daunting. This suggests that while they enjoy social interactions to some extent, they might not be as outgoing or energetic in social settings as others might be.

This rating takes into account the individual's balance between being detail-oriented and perfectionistic (which aligns with high conscientiousness) and their selective approach to social engagement (which reflects a moderate level of extraversion).
