Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.8

The Conscientiousness score is calculated based on the person's traits related to organization, diligence, perfectionism and social boldness which are all rated higher than average in this individual. These qualities align with the dimensions of conscientiousness, such as being orderly, responsible, and efficient.

For Extraversion, while there isn't a strong indication that leans towards either high or low, the traits mentioned (sociability, liveliness) lean slightly more towards extraversion by showing an openness to social interaction and enthusiasm. The decision-making trait of prudence leans more towards introversion as it involves delayed action after reflection.

Hence, given these factors, this individual has a moderately high score for conscientiousness due to strong adherence to responsibility, orderliness and efficiency, alongside moderate scores in extraversion based on their openness to social engagement and occasional extroverted behaviors like motivating others or making jokes.
