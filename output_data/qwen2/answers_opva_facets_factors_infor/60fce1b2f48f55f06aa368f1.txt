Conscientiousness: 7/10 

The individual demonstrates strong attention to detail, meticulous preparation before undertaking tasks requiring precision, and a proactive approach in handling challenges with perfectionism. These traits align well with high conscientiousness, which includes being organized, dependable, and responsible.

Extraversion: 5/10 

Though the person interacts effectively during situations like team relocation, indicating some level of social engagement and adaptability to challenging circumstances, they are primarily described as introspective and focused on the task at hand. The latter behavior suggests a slightly lower level of extraversion, which is characterized by sociability, assertiveness, and energy in social interactions.

The rating takes into account that while the individual shows a willingness to engage with their team during negative situations, they seem more inclined towards internal reflection and preparation than actively seeking out social interactions or being the life of the party.
