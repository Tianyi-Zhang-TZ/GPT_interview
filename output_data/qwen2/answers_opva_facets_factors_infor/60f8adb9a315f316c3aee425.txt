Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.0

Explanation:

Conscientiousness involves traits like organization, diligence, dependability, and orderliness. Based on the answers provided:
- For Organization (Question 2), the person clearly demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness by managing their workspace effectively and efficiently.
- The answer for Diligence (Question 4) also supports a strong rating in Conscientiousness as they were able to handle challenging tasks by working extremely hard to meet deadlines, showing persistence and reliability.

On the other hand:
- Sociability (Question 5) indicates a lower score. While the individual is social with select colleagues, it doesn't indicate an overall high level of extraversion or sociability.
- The responses for Social self-esteem (Question 1), Social boldness (Question 3), and Liveliness (Question 7) don't strongly contribute to the Extraversion score since they focus more on internal feelings rather than social interaction.
  
The Prudence facet, which deals with impulse control (Question 8), doesn't apply in this case because there's no explicit action taken based on an impulse.

Overall, the individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and organization but seems somewhat reserved in social settings. They're dependable and persistent when it comes to their work tasks but don't seem as outgoing or extroverted compared to their conscientious traits.
