Conscientiousness: High 

Explanation: The individual consistently demonstrates diligence and attention to detail in various scenarios, such as attending an after-work social event out of a deep connection with a colleague and managing inventory meticulously at their previous job as a food and beverage manager. This shows their commitment to responsibilities, planning ahead, and striving for perfectionism.

Extraversion: Medium 

Explanation: While the individual does show some aspects of extraversion when engaging deeply with colleagues or celebrating personal milestones (as seen in attending a colleague's retirement party), they generally prefer keeping work-life balance separate from personal life. This suggests that while they can exhibit extroverted traits when necessary, they do not lean towards being highly outgoing and social by nature.

The ratings reflect the overall tendencies observed across multiple situations related to different facets of personality within the Conscientiousness trait.
