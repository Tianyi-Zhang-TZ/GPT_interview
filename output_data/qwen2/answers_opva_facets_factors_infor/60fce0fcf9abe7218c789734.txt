Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5  

Explanation:

The individual exhibits traits that align with the Conscientiousness trait, which involves diligence and responsibility. This is evident through their focus on details, their ability to handle tasks requiring attention to detail without making mistakes, managing people remotely effectively, planning morale-boosting events for team members, and striving for perfectionism.

However, they also display tendencies that are more in line with the Extraversion trait. Their shyness, anxiety when faced with large groups of people, preference for solitude over social activities outside work, and their fear of being judged negatively by colleagues might indicate a lower level of extraversion. Additionally, their response to interruptions during focused tasks suggests they may be sensitive to distractions and prefer uninterrupted time.

In summary:

Conscientiousness: The individual shows responsibility, diligence, and effectiveness in managing tasks and people, which are indicative of high conscientiousness.

Extraversion: The individual's introverted nature, shyness, and anxiety in social settings suggest a lower level of extraversion. Their preference for solitary activities over social ones also supports this rating.
