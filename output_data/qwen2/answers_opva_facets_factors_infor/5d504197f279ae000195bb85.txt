Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Low

Explanation:

Based on the descriptions given, it's clear that the person is quite conscientious and responsible in their approach to work situations, especially when considering long-term effects for themselves or their company. This aligns with high levels of Conscientiousness, which generally refers to traits such as organization, responsibility, and attention to detail.

On the other hand, when discussing social situations and interactions with unfamiliar people, the person appears quite hesitant and potentially introverted, opting out of events they perceive might be uncomfortable or unappealing. This inclination towards avoiding social settings that cause discomfort aligns with lower levels of Extraversion, which typically involves being outgoing, sociable, and energized by social interactions.

The detailed explanations for each question further support these ratings:

- For the first situation regarding social events, the description reflects a preference for avoiding uncomfortable or unnecessary social gatherings, indicating low interest in Extraverted activities.
- In the second scenario about paying attention to details in work tasks, the individual's response is meticulous and detail-focused, aligning with high levels of Conscientiousness. This facet involves being organized, reliable, and diligent, which are traits typically associated with people who prefer precise and methodical work processes over spontaneous action.
- The third question pertains to lifting team spirits during down times. While this situation doesn't explicitly show a preference for Extraverted behavior, it does highlight the individual's concern for others' well-being and ability to adapt their approach based on the situation (such as being task-oriented rather than overly emotional). This shows a balance between social awareness and responsible action that could be indicative of a moderate level of both Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability, which isn't explicitly quantified in the template but is implied by the ability to handle others' moods without needing to rely on impulsive or potentially harmful methods.

Overall, while there might not be direct ratings for each facet (Conscientiousness: 7/10, Extraversion: 3/10), these are based on the descriptions provided and align with a general understanding of high Conscientiousness and low to moderate levels of Extraversion in this individual's personality.
