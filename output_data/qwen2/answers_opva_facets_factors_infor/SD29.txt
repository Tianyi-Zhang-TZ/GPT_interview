Conscientiousness: 8/10 

Extraversion: 7/10

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is the personality trait that involves being responsible, organized, and dependable. It reflects how well an individual organizes their responsibilities, performs tasks diligently, and strives for excellence.

The provided answers demonstrate a high level of conscientiousness across various situations:
- In Question 6 (paying attention to details), showing careful reading and avoidance of mistakes suggests strong attention to detail and dedication.
- In Question 8 (acting on impulse at work), the decision not to leave early despite wanting to due to concern for colleagues shows thoughtful consideration and responsibility.

Extraversion is related to being outgoing, social, energetic, assertive, and talkative. It reflects how much an individual seeks interaction with others.

The responses exhibit a moderate level of extraversion:
- Question 6 involves the solo task of carefully analyzing questions without direct interaction.
- Question 7 has the person encouraging her team despite negative circumstances, which is indicative of social skills and motivation to uplift those around them.
- Question 8 focuses on internal thoughts and actions rather than interactions with others.

The overall ratings reflect that while there are signs of both traits, the individual leans more towards being conscientious and moderately extraverted.
