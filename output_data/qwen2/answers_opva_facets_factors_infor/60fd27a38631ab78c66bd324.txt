Conscientiousness: 4/5

Extraversion: 2/5

Explanation:

The individual described exhibits traits that generally align with Conscientiousness, particularly in terms of Diligence and Liveliness. In situations where they have the option to join an after-work social event (Question 5), their preference for solitude over social settings suggests a lower inclination towards engaging in activities that may require more sociability or extraversion. However, their willingness to help boost team morale when others are feeling down indicates a certain level of responsibility and care for others, which is consistent with Conscientiousness.

Regarding Extraversion, the individual's preference for quiet social settings and comfort in one-on-one interactions (Question 6) suggests they may lean towards Introversion rather than Extraversion. They express discomfort or anxiety around larger group settings where they might be required to pay attention to detail or follow instructions closely, which typically aligns with traits of introverted personalities who often feel more energized by solitary activities or deep conversations.

The rating for Conscientiousness is high due to the individual's demonstrated diligence and responsibility in various situations. The rating for Extraversion is lower because they prefer solitude and may not thrive in social settings that require extensive interaction.
