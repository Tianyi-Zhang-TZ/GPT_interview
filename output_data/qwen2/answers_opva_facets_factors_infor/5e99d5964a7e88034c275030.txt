Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Medium

Explanation:

The individual described exhibits a high level of conscientiousness, as shown by their dedication and hard work in managing stress while working on a demanding project. They were able to prioritize their focus and ensure the completion of tasks effectively despite dealing with challenging emotions like being upset about not meeting expectations. Their commitment to perfectionism is also evident through their desire for everything to be done perfectly.

However, the level of extraversion seems relatively moderate based on the provided text. The individual mentions caring for colleagues when they are feeling down and tries to offer support or encouragement in a respectful manner. They also display a sense of empathy by considering how others might feel about specific decisions (like not offering products at discounted prices). This suggests that while they have some tendency towards extraversion, their actions seem more focused on maintaining harmony and consideration for others' feelings rather than seeking personal stimulation.

The individual's behavior aligns with traits typically associated with high conscientiousness but medium to low-to-medium levels of extraversion.
