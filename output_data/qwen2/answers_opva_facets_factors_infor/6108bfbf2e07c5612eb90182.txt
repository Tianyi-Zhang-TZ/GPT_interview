Conscientiousness: 8/10

The individual demonstrates high levels of conscientiousness in their approach to teamwork and personal goals. In the situation described, they took initiative by mediating between a problematic team member and others to ensure she didn't feel isolated or left out during summer training. This shows their commitment towards team harmony and support for fellow members, which is indicative of strong conscientiousness. Their proactive approach in applying for a role as an instructor at the new student orientation program also aligns with this trait.

Extraversion: 6/10

In the context provided, there are mixed indications of extraversion based on the individual's responses. When they helped the struggling team member during summer training and acted neutrally despite their introverted personality, it shows their ability to adapt and help others in need. This can be considered an example of them stepping out of their comfort zone for a greater purpose.

However, their decision not to act impulsively on personal desires aligns better with introversion as they preferred to use their prudence instead of allowing emotions or immediate impulses to drive actions. Overall, the individual seems slightly more introverted than extraverted based on these responses.

The ratings reflect that while the individual shows some extroverted traits in helping others and stepping out of their comfort zone, their conscientious nature is more prominent as they consistently show a high level of responsibility, care for team dynamics, and prudence in decision-making.
