Extraversion: 3

Explanation:

**Conscientiousness**: This individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness across the provided scenarios, showing characteristics such as attention to detail, responsibility, and the ability to handle tasks diligently even when they're not mandatory. The focus on self-assurance during challenging tasks like quoting HTML or video editing indicates their strong work ethic and commitment to excellence.

**Extraversion**: The extraversion rating is lower compared to conscientiousness, suggesting a more introverted nature.

They tend to listen more than lead, asking others about their needs rather than imposing solutions or seeking direct involvement in others' personal issues.
