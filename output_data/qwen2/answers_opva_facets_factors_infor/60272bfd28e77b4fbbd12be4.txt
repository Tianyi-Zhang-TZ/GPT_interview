Conscientiousness: 4/5

The individual described shows traits that align well with conscientiousness, particularly in their meticulous approach to tasks requiring attention to detail (question 6). This indicates a strong level of organization and responsibility towards completing work accurately without making mistakes. Their cautious nature when it comes to taking risks suggests they prioritize reliability and efficiency.

Extraversion: 2/5

While the individual can engage more comfortably in after-work social events, especially those centered around hobbies like salsa dancing (question 6), they also tend to be introspective and feel shy or nervous in more formal settings. This shows a moderate level of extraversion with occasional forays into extroverted behavior but not consistent across all situations.

Overall, the individual demonstrates conscientiousness by focusing on detail-oriented tasks and exercising prudence in making decisions that involve potential risks. However, their social behavior is more introverted than extroverted based on the provided descriptions. The individual may benefit from finding a balance between being diligent with tasks and engaging more confidently in social interactions.
