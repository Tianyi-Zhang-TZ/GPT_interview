Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.8

Explanation:

The person demonstrates strong organizational skills and a sense of responsibility, as shown by their commitment to cleaning up after themselves at work (Question 2) and avoiding messy situations that could inconvenience others.

In terms of Social self-esteem (Question 1), the individual acknowledges their initial shyness but also adapts when necessary. This indicates they are adaptable and not solely reliant on their social status or approval, which contributes to a reasonable level of conscientiousness.

The person exhibits some degree of liveliness (Question 7) in trying to spark conversation with colleagues to lift spirits, but this is limited, suggesting that while they might care about others' well-being to an extent, they may not be particularly outgoing in social situations.

Regarding prudence (Question 8), the individual seems cautious and honest, which aligns with conscientious behavior. They avoid breaking rules and are more inclined towards stability rather than impulsiveness.

In terms of Diligence (Question 5) and Perfectionism (Question 6), the person is detail-oriented but sometimes struggles under pressure or when dealing with demanding customers, indicating they strive for excellence yet face challenges in consistent performance.

Sociability (Question 3) seems to be moderate, as indicated by their participation in an after-work social event rather than always seeking out such situations. 

Diligence (Question 4) is also moderately high; the person works hard when necessary but finds it challenging to maintain focus under certain conditions.

The overall ratings reflect a mix of conscientious and somewhat reserved behavior with occasional fluctuations in performance and adaptability across different scenarios, suggesting an average level of both traits.
