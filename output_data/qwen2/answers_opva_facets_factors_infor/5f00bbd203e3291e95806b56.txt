Conscientiousness: 4.5  
Extraversion: 3  

Explanation:
The individual demonstrates a strong level of conscientiousness across various contexts, as shown through their responsibility in medication administration, attention to detail, and efforts to ensure tasks are completed correctly. They display diligence and prudence by considering consequences before acting impulsively or without thinking. Their perfectionism is evident when they double-check their work to avoid errors.

On the other hand, the individual exhibits a relatively lower level of extraversion as compared to conscientiousness. The responses indicate that while they can socialize with colleagues and show interest in improving relationships outside of work, they tend towards shyness initially and require time to form close connections. Their preference for detail-oriented tasks might sometimes lead them to appear more introverted since these activities often involve solitary concentration.

The individual's sociability could be seen as a balance between being friendly and supportive among colleagues but possibly needing more time or confidence to engage in after-work social events, which aligns better with their introverted nature. However, they show the ability to listen and empathize when needed, which can also indicate a level of extraversion in interpersonal interactions.

In summary, while they exhibit strong conscientiousness due to their carefulness, responsibility, and planning skills across different situations, their level of extraversion is moderate as they balance their social activities with a more introspective or cautious approach.
