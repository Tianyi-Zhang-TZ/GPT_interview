Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5  

Explanation:

The Conscientiousness score reflects the individual's reliability, organization, and responsibility. The person demonstrates a strong dedication to tasks when fully focused, indicating a high level of conscientiousness in such moments. However, their struggle with attention to detail without medication suggests areas for improvement, which slightly reduces the overall rating.

The Extraversion score takes into account the person's sociability and energy levels during social interactions. They seem eager to build relationships both within and outside work settings, but are also aware of potential workplace gossip that could arise from socializing with co-workers of different genders. This suggests a balanced level of extraversion, neither too introverted nor overly extroverted.

The overall ratings consider the individual's tendencies rather than specific scenarios described in each question.
