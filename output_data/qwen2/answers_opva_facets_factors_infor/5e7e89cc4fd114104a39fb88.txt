Conscientiousness: High 

Extraversion: Medium

Explanation:

In the first scenario, you exhibit high conscientiousness by being very detail-oriented and meticulous about your work on the website, showing that you are thorough and diligent in ensuring everything is perfect before it's published. This is indicative of a high level of conscientiousness as you value accuracy and quality in your tasks.

Regarding extraversion, this scenario doesn't necessarily highlight an outgoing or socially engaging personality since it focuses more on your work habits rather than social interactions. However, the act of raising spirits among colleagues suggests that you can be lively in certain contexts. The overall rating for extraversion is thus medium because while you might engage with people when needed (like offering support), this isn't a core aspect of how you typically function.

The second scenario showcases your prudence by demonstrating restraint and thoughtful decision-making, especially considering the temptation to use employee discounts impulsively at work. This shows that you're aware of financial considerations and are deliberate about spending your money wisely rather than being impulsive.

Consequently, these scenarios paint a picture of someone who is conscientious and prudent but perhaps not overly extraverted. The high level of conscientiousness stems from the careful attention to detail and diligent approach to work tasks, while prudence emerges through thoughtful decision-making and financial responsibility, particularly in situations that might involve spending or prioritizing personal desires.
