Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5  

The individual exhibits strong conscientiousness traits, as evidenced by their commitment to completing tasks carefully and avoiding errors through meticulous attention to detail (Perfectionism), willingness to take on responsibilities even when they're not mandatory (Liveliness), persistence in achieving personal goals despite obstacles like gender biases in the workplace (Prudence), and proactive behavior in anticipating potential issues (Sociability). Their perfectionist nature and diligence also reflect higher conscientiousness. However, there is a lower rating for extraversion due to their preference for staying away from drinking at social events where others might engage heavily in it and choosing not to join such activities after work hours.
