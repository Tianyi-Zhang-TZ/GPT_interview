Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 3.0 

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated as 4.5 because the individual shows responsibility, organization, and diligence in different situations. They are proactive about handling tasks with challenges by expanding their capabilities instead of avoiding them (Question 4). They also demonstrate a sense of leadership or initiative by sharing necessary information to ensure team members' success (Question 3). The rating is slightly lower than perfect because the individual feels more comfortable as a follower and sometimes prefers questions over leading roles. 

Extraversion is rated at 3.0 due to some social interactions where they are proactive about improving work-related relationships by participating in after-work events (Question 5) but also indicates discomfort with such situations, which might suggest reserved or introspective traits. The individual is selective about their participation in social settings and may prefer alone time as indicated by feelings of discomfort in certain scenarios.
