Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 3.8 

Explanation:

For Conscientiousness, the person is described as responsible and diligent in organizing tasks and ensuring accuracy, which aligns with high scores on the facets of Organization and Diligence. They also display social boldness by voicing opinions and suggesting solutions during discussions (Social Boldness) and show prudence when requesting items they desire at work without acting impulsively. However, their responses do not necessarily highlight a strong focus on perfectionism, as they seem to be pragmatic rather than overly meticulous.

For Extraversion, the person enjoys social interactions, introduces themselves in new settings, meets new people, and values networking for future opportunities (Social self-esteem). They also exhibit a certain level of liveliness by being supportive when team members are down. However, their responses do not necessarily suggest they derive much energy from these social activities or take center stage as leaders or entertainers, which would be indicative of higher scores on this dimension.

Given the overall pattern of behaviors described in the answers, Conscientiousness is rated slightly higher due to consistent demonstration of responsibility and goal-directed actions. Extraversion receives a slightly lower rating because although social interactions are valued, there's no strong indication of deriving energy from them or being highly outgoing.
