Conscientiousness: 8/10 

Extraversion: 6/10

Explanation:

The individual in this scenario consistently demonstrates a strong level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their tendency to power through tasks regardless of fatigue or exhaustion, ensuring diligent work performance and attention to detail. They also exhibit a good level of extraversion when they choose to participate in after-work social events, showing the ability to connect with colleagues outside of professional environments despite personal tiredness.

The Conscientiousness rating is quite high due to their demonstrated reliability and commitment towards tasks and responsibilities, which aligns well with this personality trait. The Extraversion score is slightly lower but still positive; while they are able to engage in social activities, it appears that they may not always seek out such interactions or might prioritize other activities over them.

The balance between these two traits suggests a person who values both their professional and personal life equally, managing responsibilities diligently without sacrificing meaningful connections with others.
