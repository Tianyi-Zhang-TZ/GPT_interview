Conscientiousness: 4.3 
Extraversion: 3.1 

Explanation:

Conscientiousness, also known as "honesty," is a trait that involves being organized, reliable, persistent, and self-disciplined.

1) The individual describes actively attempting to make new friends in unfamiliar social situations which indicates high scores on Conscientiousness due to their organization and willingness to adapt.
2) They show strong organizational skills when dealing with expensive equipment at work which again suggests a high score of Conscientiousness. 
3) Choosing to take the lead role during group discussions shows responsibility and assertiveness, indicating a higher score for conscientiousness.
4) Despite feeling tired after working long hours, they decided not to quit or pass on challenging tasks, showing diligence and persistence, which adds another point to their conscientiousness score.
5) The individual's choice to attend an after-work social event suggests a preference for social interaction but isn't particularly high because attending might not always be the most sociable thing to do.

Extraversion relates to one¡¯s energy level, assertiveness and need for social interaction:

1) Their effort towards making new friends in unfamiliar settings could suggest they are somewhat outgoing or extroverted.
2) Choosing to troubleshoot equipment indicates they may prefer problem-solving activities over social interactions, which is less indicative of high extraversion. 
3) Leading during group discussions might be more extroverted than typical behavior for someone who isn't a natural leader in such situations.
4) Persistently working towards challenging tasks might suggest they can handle and sometimes enjoy demanding environments but doesn't necessarily indicate an extremely extraverted nature.
5) Attending social events is somewhat reflective of an interest in social activities, which adds to their extraversion score.

In general, while the person demonstrates conscientiousness in various aspects from organization and responsibility to persistence in challenging tasks and social interactions, they exhibit lower levels of extraversion when not engaging directly with social situations. Thus, the overall ratings are Conscientiousness: 4.3 and Extraversion: 3.1
