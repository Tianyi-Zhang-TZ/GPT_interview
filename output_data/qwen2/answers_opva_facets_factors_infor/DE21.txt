Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

Explanation:

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness and some aspects of extraversion throughout the answers.

Regarding Conscientiousness, they are organized (Organization) as evidenced by their habits of cleaning up after using equipment, being detail-oriented in their tasks (Perfectionism), and taking leadership roles in group discussions (Social boldness). Their tendency to find solutions when faced with challenging tasks also aligns with conscientious traits (Diligence).

For Extraversion, they show a moderate level of extraversion by enjoying social events but also having moments where they prefer solitude or can turn down such events (Sociability). The description includes some self-disclosure and personal preference for understanding others' feelings (Liveliness), which is part of being extroverted.

The individual's overall behavior suggests a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and engagement with their work environment while also valuing relationships and social connections. However, they don't exhibit the full spectrum of extraverted behaviors, such as acting impulsively to get what they want (Prudence), which keeps the extraversion rating slightly below 4.0.

The scores are not broken down by question because each response contributes to these overall traits rather than being isolated characteristics for specific situations.
