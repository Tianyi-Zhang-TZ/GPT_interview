Conscientiousness: 5  
Extraversion: 3

This individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their meticulous attention to detail in insurance policy submissions and willingness to save money over indulging in alcohol. Their perfectionism is evident when they prioritize accuracy to avoid making mistakes that could result in financial penalties or loss of income. In terms of liveliness, they were proactive in boosting the spirits of colleagues experiencing burnout in a professional setting, showing empathy and social skill. This suggests some level of extraversion, as they are able to engage with others and influence their mood positively.

However, when it comes to impulsivity, especially related to taking action against a colleague's poor performance without just cause or without seeking a solution internally first, this behavior aligns more closely with prudence rather than immediacy in response. This suggests that despite some extroverted traits like engaging in conversations and helping others, they prefer a cautious approach in dealing with workplace issues.

Overall, their conscientiousness is rated high due to their dedication to tasks requiring attention to detail and their proactive behavior in professional settings. Their extraversion is rated as moderate given their ability to connect socially while maintaining some level of self-control and prudence in decision-making processes.
