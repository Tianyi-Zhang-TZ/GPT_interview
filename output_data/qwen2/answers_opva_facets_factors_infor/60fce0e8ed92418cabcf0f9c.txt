Conscientiousness: 4/5 

The person demonstrated traits that are consistent with high levels of conscientiousness in many aspects of their behavior and decision-making process. For instance, the individual showed a strong inclination towards diligence when deciding to push themselves out of comfort zones despite anxiety about social situations (Question 5). This trait is also evident in their meticulous attention to detail in professional roles requiring accuracy (Question 6), where they go above and beyond by cross-verifying their work with sources and seeking validation from others. Furthermore, the person's empathetic nature towards colleagues' feelings underlines a conscientious approach to team dynamics and morale management (Question 7). However, there is an element of prudence or self-restraint displayed when considering acting on impulses at work, which can also align with high conscientiousness as it highlights consideration for professional norms and values (Question 8).

Extraversion: 3/5

The responses suggest a generally moderate level of extraversion. The individual was willing to push themselves into new social situations despite being anxious about them (Question 5), which demonstrates some extraverted behavior in overcoming the initial discomfort associated with socializing. However, their description also implies that they might find social interactions more challenging than others, and thus this trait is not particularly high. Additionally, during low-wage work environments where impulse control was needed, there was a mix of self-determination and potentially more introverted tendencies, suggesting that in certain contexts, the person could lean towards being less extraverted (Question 8). The responses do not strongly indicate high levels of energy and social engagement associated with typical extraverted behavior.
