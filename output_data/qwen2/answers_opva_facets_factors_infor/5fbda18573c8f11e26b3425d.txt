Conscientiousness: 4/5 

Extraversion: 3/5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness refers to the extent to which someone is responsible, dependable, and organized in their behavior. In both scenarios described, the individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness. They are proactive in seeking group projects that align with their interests and skills (first scenario) and actively work on improving team performance after receiving lower-than-expected grades on subsequent projects (second scenario). This is indicative of responsibility and diligence, which contribute to their overall conscientiousness score.

Extraversion pertains to the extent to which someone enjoys being around others, enjoys talking about themselves, and prefers engaging with people over solitary activities. In the first scenario, this trait might have been more prominent as they were actively organizing group dynamics, which could require more interaction than in the second scenario where they focus on improving performance without dwelling on past setbacks. The individual's efforts to lighten the mood and suggest getting dinner together suggests a higher level of extraversion compared to when they're dealing with challenges or maintaining professional composure (which might have been less noticeable due to focusing more internally). This results in an overall score that leans towards moderate extraversion.

The ratings are based on the assumption that high conscientiousness is characterized by responsibility, diligence, and effective organization, while a moderate level of extraversion involves enjoying social interactions but also being capable of engaging in thoughtful reflection and dealing with challenges.
