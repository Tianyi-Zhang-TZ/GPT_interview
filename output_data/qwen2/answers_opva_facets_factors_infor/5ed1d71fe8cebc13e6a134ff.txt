Conscientiousness: 4/5

I believe that my personality leans more towards being conscientious, as seen in the answers provided for Questions 6 and 8. For example, I took time to double-check data on a spreadsheet project (Question 6) and decided against impulsively refusing inconvenient work schedule adjustments (Question 8). These actions demonstrate attention to detail, thoroughness, and consideration of both quality and efficiency, which are traits associated with the conscientious personality trait.

Extraversion: 3/5

My personality shows a moderate level of extraversion based on my answers for Questions 1-4 and 7. The experiences described in these questions involve social interactions at work, the ability to establish relationships, and efforts to boost team spirits. These actions reflect openness to new experiences and social situations characteristic of extraverted individuals. However, they do not strongly indicate high levels of energy or a deep need for social interaction.

Overall:

Conscientiousness: 4/5 because it is evident in my detailed approach towards tasks, responsibility taking for group projects, and careful planning when presented with challenging work schedules.
Extraversion: 3/5 as shown by the ability to connect with people at different settings (zoo) and efforts to motivate team members, though not showcasing a particularly outgoing or energetic nature.
