Conscientiousness: 4/5 

Extraversion: 3/5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is closely related to the traits of diligence, organization, and responsibility, which are evident in several aspects of this description. The individual mentions their detail-oriented nature as a teacher, their tendency towards being organized, their double-checking before sending out communication, their preference for filling up quickly without overthinking decisions, and their careful approach to after-work social events based on personal values rather than being overly enthusiastic or extroverted about them. These behaviors indicate that they are quite conscientious in managing tasks efficiently and considering others' feelings and requests.

Extraversion is associated with traits such as sociability, energy, and assertiveness in social situations. The person notes their ability to connect with colleagues outside of the professional environment during informal settings, which suggests some level of extraversion as they enjoy getting to know people on a personal basis without becoming overly involved or sharing too much about themselves. However, their mention of being private implies that they are not highly outgoing or socializing in large groups, indicating that their extraversion might be moderate. The individual also describes themselves as respectful and careful when it comes to respecting others' needs for space and time, which leans towards a more introverted side than fully extroverted.

Overall ratings:
Conscientiousness: 4/5 due to the focus on task-oriented behaviors and responsible decision-making.
Extraversion: 3/5 because of their preference for organic connections over overly social or assertive behavior in social settings.
