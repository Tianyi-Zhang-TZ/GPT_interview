Regarding extraversion, while not particularly outgoing or lively according to their responses, there are signs of sociability as seen from engaging with colleagues outside work hours for drinks and conversation. Their ability to act as a 'Joker' on the team also implies some level of sociability and extroversion in terms of interacting and entertaining others.
