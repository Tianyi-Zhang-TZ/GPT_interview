Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.0

Explanation:

The person exhibits traits consistent with a high score on Conscientiousness, suggesting they are generally organized, diligent, and responsible. They show an inclination towards organization in their workspace and classroom responsibilities. The individual also displays social boldness when advocating for the science department's needs during meetings. However, there is also evidence of being more reserved, particularly at first, which could indicate a moderate to slightly lower score on Extraversion.

While they are diligent in planning lessons, avoiding mistakes, and acting responsibly (such as refraining from drinking at social events), their performance seems to be more self-directed rather than engaging in spontaneous actions or impulses. They do show a willingness to help colleagues by sharing resources and assisting with technology issues, suggesting that while they might not act impulsively themselves, they can support others through collaboration.

Their tendency to engage when familiar with peers (science department members and those close by) suggests moderate levels of sociability but may become hesitant in more unfamiliar settings or situations involving alcohol. 

Overall, the individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and organizational skills associated with high Conscientiousness, while showing varying degrees of social engagement that suggest moderate to slightly lower scores on Extraversion.
