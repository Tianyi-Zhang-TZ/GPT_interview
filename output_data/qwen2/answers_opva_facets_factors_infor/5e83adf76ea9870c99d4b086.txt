Extraversion: 2.5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness (Carefulness, Organization, Diligence): Kimberly demonstrates characteristics that align with these traits across various situations. She shows organization when dealing with equipment and trying to keep things in place, diligence by tackling challenging tasks even if they're out of her comfort zone, and care about details and perfectionism when handling tasks requiring attention to detail.

Extraversion (Sociability, Liveliness): Kimberly appears relatively reserved or introverted based on the provided answers. She declines after-work social events and tends to do well in large social settings by finding connections with people through shared activities like getting drinks or food together. There's no strong indication of being highly outgoing or charismatic.

The Conscientiousness score reflects that Kimberly is generally organized, diligent when faced with challenges, careful about details, and aims for perfection. This contributes positively to her personality rating in terms of responsibility and reliability.

The Extraversion score, however, shows a more muted level of extraversion due to the preference for smaller social gatherings or solo activities like cooking tasks rather than large group settings where she would need to interact with many people simultaneously. Her introspective nature suggests a somewhat lower tendency towards the Extraverted traits in social interactions.

The overall Conscientiousness rating is slightly higher because her behavior across multiple scenarios aligns more closely with conscientious attributes, while the Extraversion rating reflects her observed tendencies that are less extroverted and more focused on personal space or quiet activities.
