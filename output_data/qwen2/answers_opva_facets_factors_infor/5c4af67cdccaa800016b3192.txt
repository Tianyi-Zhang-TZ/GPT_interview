Conscientiousness: High  
Extraversion: Low  

The Conscientiousness score is high because the individual exhibits traits such as diligence, attention to detail, perfectionism, empathy, and prudence. They prioritize tasks meticulously and are careful in their decision-making process when necessary. The level of Prudence is also reflected in choosing not to participate in social events they're not interested in or when acting on an impulse at work.

The Extraversion score is low because the individual prefers solitude over socializing, dislikes large gatherings, and finds small talk unappealing. They are reserved and more introspective, often preferring to stay home rather than engage with others for social events. Despite being empathetic towards their team members when they're feeling down, this trait does not significantly influence their overall Extraversion level as it doesn't involve seeking out or participating in high-energy social interactions.
