Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5 

Explanation:

Conscientiousness involves aspects like organization, diligence, responsibility, and perfectionism. The provided answers showcase a strong tendency towards these traits:
- Diligence was exhibited in not stopping during an allergy attack despite the option to do so, showing persistence in completing tasks.
- Perfectionism is demonstrated by paying close attention to instructions to avoid mistakes, indicating care for detail and quality of work.
- Liveliness is shown through efforts to comfort teammates who were feeling down, suggesting a concern for others' emotions.
The perfectionist response shows that the individual prefers meticulousness over impulsive action when details are crucial.

Extraversion involves aspects like sociability, assertiveness, and enthusiasm. The provided answers reflect some of these traits:
- Sociability was evident in enjoying social events with strangers and engaging in relaxed activities like dancing.
However, there isn't much evidence for high extraversion as the responses seem to focus more on conscientious behaviors than on seeking excitement or social interaction for its own sake.

Prudence is not directly addressed but could be inferred from the cautious decision-making shown in reading instructions carefully before taking action. The impulsive action of reading many books might suggest a lower rating here, given that it doesn't align with careful deliberation and planning typical of prudence.

Overall, Conscientiousness has a higher rating due to its clear demonstration in several aspects like diligence and perfectionism. Extraversion receives a slightly lower score as evidenced by social activities but not extensive involvement or enthusiasm.
