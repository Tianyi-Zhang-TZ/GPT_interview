Conscientiousness: 3/5 

My Conscientiousness score is likely around a 3 out of 5, as I tend to get nervous in certain situations which can sometimes hinder my performance or attention to detail (Question 6). However, I'm also quite perfectionistic when it comes to tasks requiring attention to details and prefer to ensure high-quality work. The situation described in Question 7 shows that I am capable of lifting team morale with a more relaxed demeanor, but I find myself being quieter until the proper time to make jokes.

Extraversion: 3/5 

My Extraversion score is likely around a 3 out of 5 (Question 8). While I can be open and lively at events outside of work settings, there are times when I might feel shy or awkward in front of people I don't know well. The scenario described in Question 7 shows that my fear of social situations leads me to initially become quiet before trying to lighten the mood with jokes.

Overall:

- Conscientiousness: This facet is balanced due to both strengths and weaknesses being identified, such as attention to detail sometimes lacking and perfectionism at other times.
- Extraversion: Similarly, this facet also balances strengths (open personality in events) and limitations (feeling shy or awkward in unfamiliar situations).
