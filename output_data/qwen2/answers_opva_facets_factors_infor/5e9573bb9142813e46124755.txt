Extraversion: 2/5

Explanation:

The description provided shows traits aligned with the Conscientiousness personality trait, which includes being organized, reliable, and disciplined in their work approach, especially when paying attention to details to avoid mistakes. This is evident from phrases like "I was very realistic" and "I ended up making very few mistakes." The person also seems willing to help friends out of difficult situations at work when it comes to the facet of Liveliness, indicating a caring and supportive nature.

However, the score for Extraversion is lower (2/5). This suggests that while they are helpful and considerate towards their colleagues and might have close relationships with them, they do not seem overly enthusiastic about social interactions or being around people. Their mention of preferring teaching over hanging out with students aligns with a more introverted personality type who may need downtime after interacting with others.

Overall, the person appears to be detail-oriented and considerate towards their work environment's dynamics while having some reservations about public interactions or acting on personal desires impulsively due to potential consequences.
