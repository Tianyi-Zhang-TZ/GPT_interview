Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.5

Explanation:

Conscientiousness, also known as diligence and organization, is rated high because the individual consistently demonstrates responsibility in various situations including equipment management at work, report production with deadline pressure, inventory maintenance of valuable assets, and teamwork spirit enhancement for depressed colleagues.

Extraversion is moderately scored due to the mix of introverted feelings during social gatherings (Question 1) and extroverted traits like taking initiative on a project (Question 8). The person shows some reserved behaviors in unfamiliar social settings but also demonstrates proactive and energetic characteristics when appropriate.
