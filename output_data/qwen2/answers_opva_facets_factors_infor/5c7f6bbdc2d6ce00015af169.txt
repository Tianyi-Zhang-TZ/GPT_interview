Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 3.5 

Reasoning:

Conscientiousness deals with the aspects of organization, diligence, responsibility and dependability.

1) This question touches on the individual's organizational skills which are associated with Conscientiousness (Organization). The person is described as proactive in addressing issues even when they lack prior knowledge or expertise.

2) The person demonstrates a high level of diligence when faced with challenging tasks.

3) There's no explicit mention of this facet here, but from the context it appears that the individual takes initiative and leadership during group discussions which could be indicative of Conscientiousness (Social boldness).

4) The individual shows a commitment to complete tasks despite challenges, indicating high levels of diligence and organization.

5) Social events are typically associated with extraversion rather than conscientiousness. However, in this context, the decision to attend the event might reflect social responsibility, which is part of Conscientiousness.

6) Paying attention to detail and being meticulous towards tasks suggests a high level of conscientiousness (Perfectionism).

7) The capacity to uplift team spirits during challenging times points more towards agreeableness or emotional intelligence than purely extraversion. However, within the scope of this rating system and considering it might fit slightly under conscientiousness if viewed as responsibility for others.

8) This response indicates prudence by not acting on immediate impulses.

Extraversion focuses on social interaction skills like sociability, assertiveness, and energy.

1) The person is described as outgoing in terms of interacting with new people which aligns well with extraversion (Sociability).

2) Being proactive about asking questions during a work situation is a social trait more closely linked to extraversion.

3) No direct connection to extraversion can be identified here.

4) This response does not directly indicate any extraverted traits like assertiveness or excitement.

5) Not attending an after-work event might reflect introversion rather than extraversion.

6) The focus on detail and meticulousness is more of a conscientious trait rather than an extraverted one.

7) While the sentiment towards team support might suggest social skills, it's not exclusively linked to extraversion.

8) The decision-making process aligns with prudence rather than an extraverted trait.

Overall:

- Conscientiousness: 4.0 suggests a high level of organization, responsibility and diligence in dealing with tasks.
- Extraversion: 3.5 reflects a generally social approach but also shows some level of self-control and decision-making skills when not to act on impulses or engage overly in social situations.

This rating system assumes that while the individual exhibits traits suggesting both conscientiousness and extraversion, there is more evidence supporting a high level of conscientiousness than extraversion.
