Based on your answers, I would rate you as follows:

Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.0

Explanation:
- Conscientiousness shows strong signs in organization, diligence, perfectionism, and liveliness. You demonstrate a high degree of responsibility and attention to detail while performing tasks and are empathetic towards others. Your responses suggest that you tend to stay focused on the task at hand, manage your time efficiently, strive for excellence in your work, and are sensitive to other people's feelings.
- Extraversion appears relatively low, based on your tendency to feel more comfortable as a listener rather than a leader in group discussions, reluctance to join after-work social events, and self-described introverted nature. You seem more reserved and prefer to spend time alone or with a small circle of friends.

Overall, you come across as highly conscientious but relatively less extraverted, with traits that suggest strong work ethic, responsibility, and emotional sensitivity, while potentially preferring solitude over social engagements.
