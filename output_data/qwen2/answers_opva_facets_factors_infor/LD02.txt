Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

Explanation:

The person demonstrates conscientiousness by showing organization, diligence, and a strong work ethic in various situations they described. For example, when faced with challenging tasks or details-heavy requirements, there is an initial response of trying to handle the task competently, though anxiety does set in if it becomes too challenging. There are also instances where perfectionism comes into play, indicating a high level of concern for quality work and striving for excellence.

Regarding extraversion, the individual appears to be outgoing and sociable. They enjoy meeting new people, engaging in social settings, taking leadership roles in group discussions, and getting excited about after-work events. There is also an inclination towards fomo (fear of missing out) which suggests a desire to be part of social activities.

Overall, while the person shows strong conscientious traits such as organization, diligence, perfectionism, and work ethic, they are slightly less extraverted due to their occasional need for time to process decisions and the stress that might come from overly detailed tasks or challenging situations.
