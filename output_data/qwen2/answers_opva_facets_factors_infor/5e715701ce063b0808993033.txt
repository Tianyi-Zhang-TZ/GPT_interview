Conscientiousness: 4/5  
Extraversion: 3/5  

Explanation:

Conscientiousness is rated as a moderate level because the individual mentions their willingness to go out and spend time with colleagues, which indicates a certain level of conscientious behavior in terms of social engagement. However, they also mention some instances where they chose not to attend events due to personal conflicts or family obligations, suggesting occasional lapses in scheduling these activities.

Extraversion is rated as somewhat lower because the individual doesn't emphasize seeking out social events frequently for enjoyment and bonding purposes outside of work responsibilities. While they are willing to participate when necessary, their preference might lean more towards introversion where spending time alone or with close friends seems more appealing.

The overall ratings reflect a balanced personality that values professional relationships but also prioritizes personal commitments and values individual time over extensive socializing.
