Extraversion: 3.8 

Explanation:

For Conscientiousness, the individual shows a high level of responsibility and organization (Organization facet), diligence in completing tasks without leaving them unfinished (Diligence facet), leadership qualities that encourage participation from others in discussions (Social boldness facet), and perfectionism in handling detailed tasks (Perfectionism facet). These traits indicate strong conscientious behavior. However, the individual's reluctance to participate in after-work social events might suggest a preference for solitary activities over social interactions, which is somewhat lower on this dimension.
