Extraversion: This trait is associated with sociability and liveliness.

- Sociability: The individual's preference for attending after-work social events and the idea of enhancing team dynamics through such interactions suggest a leaning towards extraversion.
- Liveliness: Their empathetic nature toward colleagues who are feeling down also points to higher levels of extroversion, as they engage more actively with others' emotions.
