The person demonstrates a high level of diligence and prudence, as they push themselves in challenging situations and make responsible decisions such as turning in unclaimed money instead of taking it for themselves. They also show perfectionism when dealing with tasks requiring attention to detail. However, their social boldness is relatively low, as they were reserved in a high-social strata setting and preferred a more passive role during group discussions. Their liveliness appears moderate since they feel others' stress but do not necessarily share it openly and immediately. The person shows sociability when being invited out for after-work events but was willing to step outside their comfort zone, indicating an ambivalent attitude towards social situations. Their organization skills are high as evidenced by the responsibility shown in managing tasks and equipment at work. Lastly, their social self-esteem could be considered average as they seem aware of their position relative to others' status and felt discomfort due to it but were not overly self-critical about this situation specifically.

Overall ratings consider the person's general behavior and responses across all questions under each facet rather than based on individual question relevance.
