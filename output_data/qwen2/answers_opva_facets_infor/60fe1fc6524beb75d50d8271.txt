Diligence: 8/10 

The individual shows great attention to detail and aims for thoroughness in their work, which indicates a high level of diligence. However, there's no evidence of overextending themselves or lacking in any aspect of this facet when compared against other traits mentioned.

Perfectionism: 7/10 

While the person tries very hard to be as detailed as possible and admits that mistakes can happen despite their efforts, perfectionism is not overly dominant. The recognition of limitations within the scope of detail-oriented work suggests a healthy balance rather than obsessive perfectionism.

Prudence: 9/10 

The individual is careful in making decisions, plans ahead for future actions, and acts based on thorough consideration before acting impulsively. This cautious approach aligns well with prudence as it demonstrates thoughtful decision-making over emotional impulses or immediate desires.

Social boldness: 4/10 

Although the person is open to attending social events after work, they seem hesitant about the initial invitation and prefer not to force participation when unsure of their feelings. This suggests a level of shyness or caution in unfamiliar social situations, hence lower social boldness.

Liveliness: 6/10 

The individual respects others' emotions during tough times without trying to immediately uplift spirits or force positivity. This empathetic approach shows they're mindful of the impact of their actions on others but does not necessarily highlight a lively or outgoing personality.

Sociability: 5/10 

While this person is willing to attend social events and doesn't regret doing so, their response also indicates some level of hesitation and uncertainty about engaging spontaneously. This suggests that while they do participate in social activities, sociability might not be one of their defining characteristics.

Social self-esteem: 7/10 

The individual appears confident enough in their actions regarding their coworkers but seems somewhat reserved when it comes to initiating or leading social events after work hours. This reflects a moderate level of confidence balanced with some degree of introspection and respect for others' emotions and needs.

Organization: 8/10 

Efforts are made to plan ahead, consider the impacts of decisions, and think through problems before taking action. The planning shows a high level of organization, indicating an effective approach to managing tasks and responsibilities at work.
