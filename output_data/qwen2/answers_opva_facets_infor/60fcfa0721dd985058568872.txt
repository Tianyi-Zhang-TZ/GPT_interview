Diligence: 4.5

Reasoning: The person mentions being very outgoing and productive at work, often volunteering to do tasks others might avoid. They are willing to push themselves when the task is challenging and prefer to handle it themselves rather than leave it aside or delegate it.

Perfectionism: 3.5

Reasoning: There's an indication that they are detail-oriented but there isn't a strong emphasis on being meticulous about avoiding mistakes in every situation described, which suggests some room for flexibility depending on the context of tasks.

Prudence: 4.0 

Reasoning: They consider potential outcomes before acting impulsively and seek to pitch their best efforts rather than act on impulses when seeking something they want badly at work.

Social boldness: 3.5

Reasoning: While they are outgoing with people they know, there is no clear indication of them leading conversations or being the primary source of energy in social events. They seem comfortable enough in these settings but might not actively drive them.

Liveliness: 2.0
