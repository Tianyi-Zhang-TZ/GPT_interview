Sociability: 3/5

While the individual can contribute positively to teamwork by being personable and focusing on creating professional relationships with colleagues, they tend to maintain a clear boundary between work and personal life. This may limit their social interactions after work hours unless it aligns with their professional duties or goals.

Social self-esteem: 4/5
