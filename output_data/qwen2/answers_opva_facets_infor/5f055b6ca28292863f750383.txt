Diligence: 4/5

I tend to be quite detail-oriented and prefer to take my time to ensure tasks are done correctly the first time, which shows a high level of diligence.

Perfectionism: 3/5  

While I do strive for accuracy, I'm aware that perfection is unattainable. Sometimes, I might not stress too much about minor mistakes if they won't significantly impact outcomes.

Prudence: 4/5

In most situations, especially when it comes to others' well-being and personal boundaries, I tend to be cautious and considerate of other people's needs and feelings.

Social boldness: 2/5

I'm hesitant in large groups or unfamiliar settings where social interactions are more prominent. However, this doesn't necessarily affect my professional environment as much because there might be structured tasks rather than spontaneous social engagements.

Liveliness: 3/5  

In my personal life, I can often raise spirits with a positive attitude and by being attentive to others' emotions. In work settings where I'm not the leader or main decision-maker, this trait doesn't play as significant of a role.

Sociability: 2/5

I do try to accept invitations for social events but often find them uncomfortable due to lack of familiarity with people in large groups. This impacts my networking and professional relationships negatively.

Social self-esteem: 4/5

I generally feel confident enough about myself to navigate most situations, although I might struggle with new social interactions that don't align with my comfort zones.

Organization: 3/5 

While I'm good at managing tasks related to detail and perfectionism, organization isn't a core strength. However, this doesn't significantly affect my professional performance since time management is well-supported in most work environments.

Rating summary:

I am diligent and perfectionistic about details but avoid unnecessary risks when it comes to personal interactions. My prudence balances well with the need for social engagement at times, yet I struggle with large group settings due to lower social boldness. Liveliness contributes positively towards raising spirits among colleagues, though organization isn't my strongest skill set. These traits together form a complex but generally effective profile in both professional and personal environments.
