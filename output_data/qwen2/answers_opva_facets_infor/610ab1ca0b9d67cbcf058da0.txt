Diligence: High

Reasoning: The individual described was working long hours, even on weekends and after midnight, to complete tasks they felt were necessary or wanted by others. This shows a strong commitment towards work and responsibilities over prolonged periods.

Perfectionism: High 

The person's attention to detail in their professional duties indicates that they strive for excellence and accuracy without settling for anything less than what they consider to be perfect. This is demonstrated when they review their work multiple times to ensure no mistakes are made.

Prudence: Medium

The individual tends to act on impulse to secure resources they want at work, such as tables or desks, but has not faced significant repercussions from these actions so far. This suggests a balance in risk assessment and decision-making under urgency.

Social Boldness: Low 

When invited to an after-work social event, the person felt nervous about attending because of their new status at the school. They tended to stay within their comfort zone by only interacting with their team members instead of exploring broader connections, indicating somewhat low levels of boldness in social settings.

Liveliness: Medium

The individual's teaching profession often experiences emotional highs and lows due to student performance or feedback. While they try to remain positive during tough times, their response is not overly animated or energizing but rather a balanced attempt at uplifting others when needed.

Sociability: Low 

Due to initial shyness and self-consciousness in social settings like the Christmas party, the person's interaction was limited to team members only. This suggests low sociability, as they did not venture out of their comfort zone or make efforts to connect with a broader group.

Social Self-Esteem: Medium

In situations where teammates were down due to job-related stressors, the individual tried to remain positive by acknowledging their colleague's contributions and pointing out strengths. This indicates moderate levels of self-esteem as they are able to boost others' spirits but might not do so in every situation without prompting.

Organization: High 

The person is very detail-oriented and organized when handling tasks that require attention to details, such as entering student data into spreadsheets or reviewing their work before submission. This high level of organization supports effective management of complex tasks with accuracy and efficiency.
