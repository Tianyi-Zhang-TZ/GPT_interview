Based on the answers provided, I will rate the personality according to the HEXCO model.

Diligence: 3.5  
The individual is willing to try and find ways to improve themselves by seeking out people with similar interests, trying to work on personal tasks even when challenging, but there are also instances of asking for help or passing projects if they're unsure about their ability to complete them independently.

Perfectionism: 4
There's a focus on details, willingness to ensure no mistakes in tasks, and the individual asks for help after completing tasks which suggests an emphasis on perfection. However, there is also mention of being overlooked on small things at times when checking themselves, indicating a balance between striving for perfection and acknowledging personal limitations.

Prudence: 3
The person seems thoughtful about acting impulsively, considering potential impacts on others in the workplace environment. While this shows some level of prudence, it might not always be consistent based on instances where they express frustration due to wanting something badly at work without considering actions' repercussions.

Social boldness: 2.5
Social situations are challenging for the individual, often preferring a listening role or stepping back from leadership positions unless necessary. However, there's willingness to connect with others and support team members when needed, indicating that social interactions can be handled better in supportive or familiar contexts.
