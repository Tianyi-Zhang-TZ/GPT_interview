Liveliness: Medium  
Sociability: High  
Social self-esteem: High  
Organization: High 

Explanation:
The individual demonstrates high levels of diligence and prudence throughout the scenarios mentioned. This is evidenced by their careful preparation, attention to detail when required (a reflection of perfectionism), and thoughtful actions that avoid potentially vindictive or rash decisions.

In terms of sociability, despite initial shyness, they are able to engage with others and enjoy social events when invited, indicating a good level of sociability. Their liveliness is moderate as shown by their ability to inject humor into situations where spirits may be low and their organization skills are high from managing tasks requiring meticulous attention.

The individual's social self-esteem seems quite high as they feel comfortable enough in certain contexts (like with close friends) to let others buy them drinks or engage in more relaxed behaviors. However, they seem less at ease when plans are forced upon them without much notice, which is likely a reflection of their lower score for social boldness.
