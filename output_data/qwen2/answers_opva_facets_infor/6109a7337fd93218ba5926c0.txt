Diligence is rated as a strong trait, suggesting they are generally very thorough and committed. Perfectionism receives an even higher rating due to their focus on detail in critical tasks. Prudence is rated extremely high because of their thoughtful approach and strategic planning before acting.

Social boldness has the lowest rating because they prefer staying home or avoiding social events when given a choice, indicating discomfort with social situations. Liveliness rates as moderate; while they can show empathy and support for others' feelings, they might not be overly extroverted or lively themselves. Sociability is rated middle of the scale - they want to build relationships but are also happy staying home.
