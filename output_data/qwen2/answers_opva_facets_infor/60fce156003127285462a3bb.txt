Social boldness: Moderate  
Liveliness: Low  
Sociability: High  
Social self-esteem: High  
Organization: High 

Reasoning:

Diligence is high because the individual in each scenario demonstrated a meticulous approach to their tasks. In question 6, they meticulously measured and calculated aspects of the project involving chemicals; in question 7, she was there for her struggling teammate when needed showing a diligent attitude towards supporting others; and in question 8, despite having an impulse to immediately act on the promotion opportunity at work, she displayed prudence by relying on her consistent performance.

Perfectionism is also high as evidenced by their meticulousness in question 6 and willingness to jump in and help her teammate when they're struggling in question 7. They are keenly aware of details and strive for excellence.

Prudence has a moderate rating because while they planned actions carefully, especially during the project involving chemicals (question 6), there were times where they did not impulsively act on their impulses such as with the promotion at work (question 8).

Social boldness is rated moderately. While they showed sociability and willingness to support others in question 7, this trait does not seem to be a primary characteristic of their personality.

Liveliness is low since there's no indication that they are particularly outgoing or energetic individuals who enjoy being the life of the party or engaging in spontaneous activities.

Sociability is rated high due to their active involvement and willingness to support others when needed, as shown in question 7.

Social self-esteem appears to be high based on their confidence in handling tasks requiring attention to detail (question 6), their proactive help for teammates facing mental health struggles (question 7), and the successful outcome of a work-related promotion they were aiming for (question 8).

Organization is rated high as evidenced by their careful planning, meticulous execution of tasks, and being consistently responsible at work.
