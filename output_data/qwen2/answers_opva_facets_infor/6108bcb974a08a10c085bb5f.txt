The individual shows high diligence, as they are willing to work overtime and push themselves beyond their limits to complete tasks. However, they might lack perfectionism since they did not want to go back and redo a job despite the possibility of making mistakes.

In terms of prudence, the individual is cautious but not overly so; they decided against taking action that could lead to conflict or trouble at work even though they felt justified in asking for a raise. 

Social boldness is quite low since they did not stand up assertively or make any bold moves when team members were feeling down.

Liveliness seems adequate, as the individual was honest and caring toward their co-worker who seemed down, which can be seen as lively behavior.

Sociability could be considered average, as they are willing to attend work-related social events but do not seek them out on a regular basis. 

Social self-esteem is also around average since they did not assert themselves for the raise despite feeling justified and might have settled for less rather than take action due to fear of starting trouble.

Organization skills seem strong, as evidenced by their careful attention to details in tasks that require precision.
