Explanation:

The user seems to be a diligent individual who takes their work seriously and tries to ensure that they are doing it right. This is indicated by phrases such as "because I'm goal oriented" and "I try to live my life like that". However, the perfectionist aspect seems to have both positive (like being well-organized) and negative impacts (such as feeling cynical and pessimistic).

Their prudence rating is moderate because they seem to have made a decision not to take extra office supplies despite potentially needing them elsewhere. This suggests they consider consequences before taking action.

Social boldness is lower, possibly due to the user's preference for being more laid-back and less inclined to immediately engage in social activities like attending office parties.

Liveliness rating seems moderate as well; while there are indications of trying to make people laugh and be positive at work, it isn't overly emphasized throughout their description.

Sociability is rated higher due to the user's willingness to help others and make themselves available for assistance even with personal tasks. 

Social self-esteem appears quite high based on phrases like "I'm really sorry", suggesting a level of self-awareness and care about others' perceptions.

Organization skills are likely strong as indicated by their goal-oriented nature, which often requires effective planning and management of responsibilities.
