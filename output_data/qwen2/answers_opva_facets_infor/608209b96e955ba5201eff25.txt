Explanation:
The person appears to be somewhat diligent but tends to avoid tasks that are challenging or out of their comfort zone (Diligence). This makes the rating a little lower than average on this facet.
On Perfectionism, they show signs of being quite detail-oriented and conscientious in situations where attention to details is crucial (e.g., taking online courses and completing attention checks), giving them a higher score here. 

In terms of Prudence, they are more likely to avoid taking immediate impulses or actions that could have negative consequences, such as eating large quantities of cheese on the job without permission (Prudence). This leads to a lower rating in this area.

Social boldness is around average; while they can take charge and organize groups when necessary, they also tend towards social awkwardness and avoid unknown social settings due to discomfort with self-esteem issues (Social boldness).

Liveliness seems low because the individual doesn't seem to spontaneously raise spirits or engage in uplifting behaviors for others who are feeling down, which is more indicative of a lower score on this facet.

Sociability is also moderate-low as they prefer activities where there is already familiarity and often avoids unfamiliar social gatherings due to feelings of discomfort (Sociability).

Social self-esteem has a somewhat positive rating since the individual has confidence enough to take charge in group situations when needed, indicating some level of belief in their abilities or roles.

The score for Organization comes from their ability to handle details meticulously in tasks requiring such attention and manage online studies efficiently.
