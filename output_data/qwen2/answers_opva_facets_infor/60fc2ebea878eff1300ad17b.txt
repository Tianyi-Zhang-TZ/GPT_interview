This rating system reflects the personality traits described throughout your explanation.

Diligence is rated as a strong trait because you seem to manage your emotions and mental health effectively, maintaining an overall positive outlook on life. This diligence includes addressing negative emotions appropriately through positive thoughts or engaging in activities that boost happiness without invalidating feelings.

Perfectionism could be considered moderate (6). Although perfectionism isn't explicitly mentioned, your tendency to balance care for others with a desire not to dismiss their feelings suggests there's room for flexibility and pragmatism in how you approach challenges. Perfection can sometimes lead to over-critical self-assessment or unrealistic expectations, which might hinder progress.

Prudence is rated very high (9) as shown by your thoughtful handling of finances and mindful consumption choices. You've developed strategies that allow you to enjoy a sense of gratification without compromising your financial stability, demonstrating responsible decision-making skills.

Social boldness seems low (4). Your preference for maintaining emotional stability might sometimes hinder you from expressing or sharing your feelings openly with others, which can impact your ability to connect deeply in social situations. This restraint could stem from a desire to keep things stable and avoid negative reactions, possibly stemming from previous experiences where emotions were not handled well.

Liveliness is rated as moderately high (5) because while you appreciate living life to the fullest within your personal comfort zone, you might find it challenging to relate deeply to people experiencing intense feelings. This could limit emotional depth in relationships but doesn't necessarily impede your overall enjoyment of life.

Sociability rates at a solid 7 because despite some hesitations or concerns about how others perceive you, you actively seek connections and maintain relationships without overstepping boundaries set by personal comfort levels.

Social self-esteem is rated as above average (8) since you value yourself enough to engage in activities that make you happy but also show care for others. This balance indicates a healthy self-assessment while maintaining emotional stability.

Organization rates at mid-range (6). While you manage your personal and professional life efficiently, the struggle with impulse buying suggests room for improvement in setting strict boundaries around spending habits without compromising enjoyment or well-being.

In summary, your personality is characterized by a blend of diligence, prudence, and social self-esteem. Your perfectionism and liveliness might sometimes influence decision-making processes or emotional reactions, respectively, while your levels of social boldness and organization could benefit from more openness in social interactions and structure in financial decisions, respectively.
