Reasoning:
- Diligence is high as shown by their tendency to ask for clarification and seek help when needed, indicating strong attention to detail and commitment.
- Perfectionism is medium because the individual describes themselves as perfectionistic but also states that they are open to receiving instructions rather than demanding them. This suggests a level of flexibility in adhering to perfectionist standards while recognizing practical constraints or limitations in doing so.
- Prudence is very high due to their careful thought process, financial responsibility, and ability to consider the pros and cons before making decisions, which demonstrates cautiousness and foresight.
- Social boldness is low based on their preference for avoiding potential disappointments by seeking clarification rather than insisting on full details or confronting others directly with their needs.
- Liveliness is moderate as they are described as empathetic but not overly enthusiastic in social settings unless influenced by others' moods, which suggests a balanced energy level that adapts to different contexts.
- Sociability is moderate because the individual navigates relationships through careful consideration of others¡¯ feelings and behaviors while maintaining some personal boundaries (e.g., avoiding disappointing their manager).
- Social self-esteem seems high as indicated by their ability to self-reflect and acknowledge areas for improvement, suggesting confidence in interpersonal interactions and a healthy sense of self.
- Organization is medium because the person appears capable but not necessarily exceptional at organizing tasks or processes efficiently. The mention of needing clarification on vague instructions suggests they might occasionally require assistance or guidance when organizing work effectively.
