The individual demonstrates high diligence, as seen by their eagerness to tackle challenges and desire for leadership roles within the group discussion. They are willing to push themselves even in difficult situations rather than pass them on.

They exhibit moderate perfectionism but struggle with the level of details needed for specific tasks, occasionally leading to delays due to re-checking work instead of focusing on efficiency.

Their prudence is evident through their careful consideration before speaking up, especially when they perceive that the situation might lead to negative outcomes. This shows a strategic approach in dealing with situations requiring communication at work.
