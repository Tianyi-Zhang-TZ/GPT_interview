Diligence: High

In all the situations described, it can be seen that you are proactive and persistent in pursuing what you want or desire. This is evident from your willingness to join social events at work to bond with colleagues, handling tasks that require attention to detail effectively by delegating them to others who excel in this area, raising spirits among team members during challenging times, and acting on impulses to achieve career goals.

Perfectionism: Moderate

While you tend to delegate tasks that are highly detail-oriented to others, your involvement suggests a certain level of perfectionism. You care about the quality of work and seem willing to invest time in ensuring things are done correctly when necessary. However, this is balanced with delegating responsibilities where you perceive yourself as not being at your strongest.

Prudence: Low

You exhibit impulsive behavior when you want something badly at work, demonstrating a lack of prudence. This could lead to hasty decisions that may have short-term benefits but might result in unforeseen consequences or personal risks. The example given about wanting to switch from sales to development without considering the long-term implications is indicative of this trait.

Social boldness: High

Your willingness to attend after work social events and interact with colleagues shows high levels of social boldness. You seem comfortable stepping out of your comfort zone for networking purposes or personal connections, indicating a strong desire to be sociable and possibly form friendships within the workplace.

Liveliness: Moderate

While you are sensitive to emotions and can boost spirits when needed, the description does not strongly suggest an exceptionally lively personality. However, your proactive approach in maintaining morale during difficult times indicates that you care about interpersonal dynamics and community spirit.

Sociability: High

The frequency with which you attend social events at work suggests a high level of sociability. You are open to integrating social activities into your professional life and seem to value the benefits it offers for networking, bonding, and creating a more cohesive team environment.

Social self-esteem: Moderate

You appear confident enough in these situations but not overly so. Your actions indicate that you seek validation through interactions with colleagues and might feel some pressure to perform well socially or professionally. However, you don't seem to overvalue yourself or undervalue others based on their responses or reactions.

Organization: High

The delegation of tasks requiring attention to detail suggests a high level of organization in your approach to work. You understand the importance of not taking on every responsibility and recognize strengths within your team that allow for effective distribution of labor, which is indicative of good organizational skills.
