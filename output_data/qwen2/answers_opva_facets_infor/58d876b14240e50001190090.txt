Diligence: 4.5  
Perfectionism: 3.0  
Prudence: 4.0  
Social boldness: 2.5  
Liveliness: 3.5  
Sociability: 2.5  
Social self-esteem: 3.0

**Explanation**: 

The individual displays traits of a generally diligent and conscientious person, as evidenced by their willingness to ensure tasks are completed correctly and persistently. This aligns well with the Diligence facet at a high level (4.5). They also show a high level of prudence in not seeking self-promotion or awards for their achievements, fitting this facet's description.

However, the individual struggles with perfectionism, as they admit to experiencing discomfort and feeling out-of-place when placed in unfamiliar social situations. This might suggest an inability to maintain standards that are too high given realistic conditions (3.0).

Regarding organization, the person manages tasks effectively despite their initial oversight of essential equipment for a meeting they facilitated, indicating strong organizational skills overall but with occasional lapses (4.0).

Social boldness is low; they tend to defer leadership roles when experienced members are present and might not be proactive about leading unless necessary or confident in doing so (2.5). This contrasts with their openness to being an active listener.

Liveliness shows some potential, as the person enjoys laughter and humor but does not overdo it when others are down (3.5), suggesting they can adjust their social demeanor appropriately without dominating a situation.

Sociability is rated at 2.5 due to the individual's preference for private time and occasional reluctance to join after-work events that do not align with personal interests or perceived benefits.

Social self-esteem is relatively stable but slightly below average, as there are instances where they feel out of place in unfamiliar social settings (3.0).

Lastly, organizational skills shine through their ability to manage tasks effectively, although this might be undermined by the initial oversight mentioned earlier (4.0). 

In summary, while the individual shows strengths across several facets, particularly Diligence and Organization, there is room for improvement in Perfectionism and Social Boldness, as well as maintaining adequate levels of Liveliness, Sociability, Prudence, and Social Self-Esteem to better align with their professional environment.
