Based on the answers provided, here's how I would rate the personality score based on the HEXCO model:

Diligence: 4.5
The person demonstrates a strong work ethic and commitment to tasks, as shown by taking on challenging projects with high stress levels and being promoted after handling them well.

Perfectionism: 3.5
While there is an inclination towards detail focus in certain situations, the lack of perfectionistic response in other contexts (like not needing to control every aspect when equipment needs organization) suggests a moderate level of concern for perfection.

Prudence: 4.0
The person exhibits cautiousness and thoughtful decision-making, particularly when considering acting on impulses and handling sensitive social situations without involving office politics.

Social boldness: 2.5
There is a preference for listening roles in group discussions and discomfort around being the center of attention at parties suggests lower levels of willingness to take initiative or lead in social settings.

Liveliness: 3.0
While there's some ability to lift spirits by focusing on positives about coworkers, this isn't a primary trait and seems to require specific conditions (like knowing something they love).

Sociability: 4.5
The person enjoys participating in after-work events and engaging with colleagues on personal levels suggests good interpersonal skills.

Social self-esteem: 3.5
There is some awareness of social situations leading to discomfort but also the ability to engage when appropriate, indicating a moderate level of social self-esteem.

Organization: 4.0
Strong inclination towards organization as demonstrated by wanting to put equipment away at work and ensuring things are in place after tasks are completed.

Overall Rating: 3.8

This score reflects an individual who is diligent, prudence-focused with some perfectionistic tendencies, good at handling social situations but not overly bold or lively, moderately socially self-assured, and organized. However, there's room for growth in social boldness and liveliness.
