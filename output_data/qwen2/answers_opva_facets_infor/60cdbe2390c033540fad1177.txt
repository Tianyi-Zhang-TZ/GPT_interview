Diligence: 8/10 

The individual displays a strong work ethic and focus on task completion, especially in situations where attention to detail is crucial to avoid mistakes.

Perfectionism: 7/10  

There's a tendency towards perfection, which can be both a strength (driving for high quality outcomes) and a potential weakness (risk of becoming overly cautious or critical). The individual seems to balance this well by understanding the importance of risk-taking and accepting challenges.

Prudence: 9/10 

The person shows a careful approach to decision making and planning, especially in situations where resources need to be managed efficiently. This is evident when they plan for office needs during work from home scenarios.

Social boldness: 6/10 

There's a level of social engagement but the individual prefers quieter environments and seems more comfortable with structured social activities rather than spontaneous events. They also demonstrate a preference for attending gatherings hosted by their workplace, indicating a certain level of boldness in professional settings.

Liveliness: 5/10 

While they enjoy fun times and seem to have an interest in lively events (like a Sunday party), there's not enough information to suggest a high degree of liveliness as a consistent personality trait. The individual seems more reserved when it comes to spontaneity and excitement-seeking behaviors.

Sociability: 7/10 

The person values social activities within the workplace context but doesn't seem overly extroverted or driven by external social events outside of professional settings. Sociability is evident in their engagement with colleagues during events, yet they might prefer more private interactions than group-oriented activities.

Social self-esteem: 8/10 

Given that they attend and enjoy company events, this suggests a relatively healthy level of confidence when it comes to social interactions within the workplace context. However, there's no explicit evidence regarding their self-perception in broader social situations beyond professional environments.

Organization: 9/10 

The individual exhibits strong organizational skills as evidenced by managing deadlines, coordinating team efforts, and planning resources for work-from-home scenarios efficiently. Their ability to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines is indicative of high organization levels.

In summary, this person shows a balanced mix of diligent work ethic and attention to detail, coupled with a thoughtful approach to decision making and resource management (prudence). They enjoy social activities within structured contexts but might prefer more private or planned events over spontaneous ones. While they value workplace relationships, there's room for greater liveliness in engaging with external social settings outside professional environments.
