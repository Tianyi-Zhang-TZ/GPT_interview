The person demonstrates a high level of Diligence as they showed determination to find solutions despite encountering challenges and were persistent in completing tasks, particularly when painting or fixing plumbing issues. This rating is slightly lower than the others because not every instance specifically highlights this facet.

Perfectionism receives a moderate score due to the person's insistence on putting everything back into their proper location after using equipment at work but doesn't exhibit extreme perfectionistic tendencies throughout all scenarios described.

Prudence gets a high rating as evidenced by choosing the most effective approach, which is to provide excellent customer service instead of reacting impulsively or negatively towards someone not being cooperative. 

Social boldness receives a relatively low score given that they prefer participating in discussions more passively (listening role) and found it comfortable even when there's no leader present.

Liveliness gets a moderate rating as the person uses humor appropriately to raise spirits, but this facet is only evident once across multiple situations described.

Sociability receives a high score considering their positive attitude towards after-work social events and ability to understand personalities in different settings, contributing positively to work environment.

Social self-esteem is rated moderately as they were initially somewhat uncomfortable attending an event where they didn't know anyone but managed to make the situation more comfortable by initiating conversations and engaging with others.

Organization gets a high score due to consistent adherence to routines, maintaining order when finishing painting projects or organizing tools after use.
