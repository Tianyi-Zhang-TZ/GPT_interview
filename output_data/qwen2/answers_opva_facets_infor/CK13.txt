Diligence: 4.5 

The answer to the fourth question shows that you are not someone who gives up easily and you tend to work hard even when facing challenges, which is a characteristic of high diligence.

Perfectionism: 3

While your answers to questions about attention to detail show that perfectionism can be present in certain aspects of your personality (question six), overall, you seem more willing to push through challenging tasks rather than insisting on flawlessly executing them every time. This indicates that perfectionism isn't a dominant trait.

Prudence: 4

The answer to the eighth question highlights caution and careful consideration when pursuing personal desires at work, which is indicative of prudence.

Social boldness: 3

While you might not take leading roles in group discussions unless confident or interested (question three), this doesn¡¯t suggest an overall lack of social boldness. Rather, it shows that you're selective about situations where you engage more actively socially.

Liveliness: 4

The willingness to boost team spirits when someone is feeling down indicates liveliness and a concern for others¡¯ emotional states, which are positive signs of liveliness.

Sociability: 5 

Your enthusiasm for social gatherings and your decision to attend after-work events even if not feeling well underscores high sociability.

Social self-esteem: 3

While you're aware that people might perceive you as shy or insecure in unfamiliar social situations (question one), this doesn't seem to significantly impact your day-to-day interactions or decisions. 

Organization: 4

Given your tendency to put things back neatly and prefer a clean workspace, organization is clearly a valued aspect of your personality.
