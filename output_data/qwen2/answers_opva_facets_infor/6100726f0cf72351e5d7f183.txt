The individual shows diligence when it comes to tasks requiring attention to detail, especially under high stakes where mistakes could lead to detrimental situations for the company. They are perfectionistic in such situations, possibly due to fear of making a mistake that could negatively impact their record. However, they demonstrate prudence by choosing not to show their emotions publicly when colleagues seem down at work; instead, they prefer private conversations or reaching out later after hours. Socially, this person might lack boldness and can be seen as someone who may arrive late for meetings but prefers the idea of going home immediately afterwards than staying long. They do not exhibit much liveliness or sociability in their workplace environment since their enjoyment seems to lie more in social events that come post-work rather than engaging fully during work hours. The individual does have some level of social self-esteem, considering they may feel self-conscious about potentially making mistakes at work and want to ensure they are well-prepared for social events after work. Their organization skills seem adequate but could be improved as indicated by their tendency to arrive late for meetings without adequate reason.
