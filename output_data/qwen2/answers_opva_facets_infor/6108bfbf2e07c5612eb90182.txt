The individual is diligent in their actions, especially when it comes to helping others and pursuing goals that are important to them. Their proactive behavior shows a strong drive to achieve these aims.

Perfectionism: 6/10

While the person cares deeply about tasks being done correctly, they do show flexibility by stepping out of their introverted nature for the benefit of others.

Prudence: 8/10

The individual demonstrates prudence in handling tasks requiring sensitivity and delicacy, like raising spirits during challenging times or pursuing goals with detail-oriented approach. Their careful consideration and strategic actions indicate they weigh their options thoughtfully before acting.

Social boldness: 4/10  

Given that the person is introverted by nature, this facet of social boldness seems to be somewhat lacking in their behavior. While they do help others when needed, it doesn't seem like a natural or effortless extension of their personality.

The person shows strong traits of diligence and prudence while potentially lacking confidence (social boldness) when it comes to social interaction that doesn't naturally align with their introverted nature.
