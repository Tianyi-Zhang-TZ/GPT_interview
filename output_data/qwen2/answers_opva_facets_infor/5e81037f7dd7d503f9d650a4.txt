The individual shows a strong sense of diligence as they are willing to push themselves in challenging tasks and try their best even when the difficulty exceeds their capabilities, aiming to complete it at all costs but also understanding limitations.

On perfectionism, there's moderate sensitivity with an inclination towards double-checking work before final submission to avoid mistakes. This indicates that while not obsessive, they pay attention to details which could imply a desire for high-quality output.

The individual displays a reasonable level of prudence; being cautious and thinking things through carefully before acting on impulses, though perhaps leaning slightly more on the daring side when it comes to following up on desires or impulses.

Social boldness is quite low as they may not feel comfortable being a cheerleader for down team members and might find social events awkward. 

Liveliness seems rather subdued; the person doesn't actively seek out raising spirits of others but would likely avoid negative moods themselves, possibly finding it uncomfortable to be associated with such situations.
