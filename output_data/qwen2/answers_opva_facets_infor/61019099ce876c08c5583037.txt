Explanation:

Diligence: The individual shows a strong work ethic and dedication to ensuring tasks are completed successfully, indicating high diligence.

Perfectionism: Although the person appears to strive for detail-oriented perfection in certain tasks, there is some indication of pragmatism as they acknowledge the importance of not wasting time on perfecting every single aspect. Thus, it's rated somewhat lower than Diligence.

Social boldness: Interaction with coworkers outside of work shows some discomfort initially but they do make efforts to engage. This suggests a moderate level of social boldness compared to peers.

Liveliness: The person is generally supportive of their co-workers' moods and tends to uplift them when necessary, indicating relatively high liveliness.

Sociability: While the individual enjoys social events with coworkers, there's no strong evidence suggesting they're exceptionally outgoing or popular in professional settings, hence a moderate rating for sociability.

Social self-esteem: The individual seems content with their place within the team and workplace culture but doesn't exhibit an overabundance of confidence that would be indicative of high social self-esteem.
