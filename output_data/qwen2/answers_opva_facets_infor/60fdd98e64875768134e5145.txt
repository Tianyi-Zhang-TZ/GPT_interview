Diligence: 8/10

Just as you described, diligence seems to characterize your personality when it comes to tasks that require attention to detail and the effort put into them. Your mode of working in such situations shows a level of dedication and commitment that borders on perfectionism.

Perfectionism: 7/10  

You appear to strive for excellence within your tasks, which can sometimes lead to exceptional results but might also suggest that you could benefit from more flexibility towards errors or the inclusion of 'good enough' standards. While being close to perfection is admirable in certain contexts, it may hinder efficiency and creativity if overemphasized.

Prudence: 9/10 

Your cautious nature when making decisions about risks and consequences demonstrates a high level of prudence. You seem hesitant to act impulsively or without careful consideration which prevents rash choices that might have negative repercussions on you and others.

Social boldness: 6/10

In situations requiring bold moves, such as asking for contracts from vendors, you tend to need more time to contemplate the implications before proceeding. This reflects a measured approach but could potentially limit opportunities in certain circumstances.

Liveliness: 7/10 

While not your strongest facet, liveliness is evident when you show empathy and understanding towards team members feeling down at work. Your ability to engage with emotions suggests that you can bring positivity to challenging situations through emotional intelligence.

Sociability: 8/10 

You have a social nature as evidenced by the ways in which you interact with others, showing concern for their well-being and providing support when needed. This interpersonal quality facilitates teamwork and cooperation but may also require balancing personal time and responsibilities.

Social self-esteem: 9/10 

Your confidence in managing stressful situations without relying on additional attention to detail suggests a solid sense of social self-esteem. You handle high-pressure tasks with composure which contributes positively to your interactions with colleagues.

Organization: 8/10

You are diligent about your work and possess an inclination towards organization, as shown by your tendency to think ahead in tasks that don¡¯t require additional attention to detail. However, there might be areas for improvement in maintaining a balanced organizational approach across all facets of your job.

In conclusion, your personality traits are predominantly positive, with diligence forming the core strength. Prudence enhances decision-making and social boldness could benefit from being more assertive when necessary. Your liveliness adds warmth to interactions but might need to balance this with productivity constraints at times.
