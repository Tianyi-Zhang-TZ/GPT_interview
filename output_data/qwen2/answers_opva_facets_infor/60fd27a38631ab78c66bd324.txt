The individual seems to rate as moderately diligent and lively, showing a willingness to raise spirits in a group setting and a desire for perfectionism when it comes to creativity or tasks that aren't rule-bound. However, they tend towards prudence which can be seen both positively (avoiding stepping on others) and negatively (hesitance around acting impulsively). Their social boldness is quite low, with the individual feeling anxious in group settings where they might not know many people well enough to feel comfortable joining in. They are rated as having moderate levels of sociability and social self-esteem but may struggle in new social situations due to their shyness and preference for smaller one-on-one interactions. Their organization skills seem to be lacking, which may contribute to the hesitancy around details or tasks that require a high level of focus on small components rather than the bigger picture they prefer.
