Diligence: 8/10

The individual's attitude towards after-work social events and their proactive approach to learning biomedical engineering indicate a strong desire for personal growth and dedication, which is reflected in the Diligence facet.

Perfectionism: 6/10  

While they demonstrate attention to detail during complex projects like making a prosthetic arm, this doesn't necessarily correlate with perfectionism throughout all aspects of their personality since perfectionism is more about an obsessive focus on achieving flawless results and a fear of failure or mistakes. The individual seems capable but not overly meticulous in other situations.

Prudence: 9/10

The individual's willingness to fight for club leadership demonstrates prudence, showing careful consideration before taking action, strategic decision-making (to advance their cause), and judicious use of resources (time, energy) when pursuing something they're passionate about. This aligns well with the Prudence facet.

Social boldness: 7/10

Although this person actively sought leadership positions in school clubs based on passion and desire for change, there is some indication that their social boldness could be higher since they didn't take immediate action to join or simply participate but instead advocated for leadership roles. This suggests a moderate level of assertiveness when it comes to social settings.

Liveliness: 4/10

The situation described doesn¡¯t directly reflect liveliness, which is more about energy and enthusiasm in social situations. The individual's response seems to indicate that they are capable of providing support but aren't necessarily energetic or enthusiastic by default in social scenarios.

Sociability: 5/10  

While the person shows a willingness to engage with colleagues outside work hours and sees the value in building connections, this doesn¡¯t necessarily reflect high sociability. Sociability involves being outgoing, friendly, and comfortable in diverse social settings beyond just attending events or having colleagues as friends.

Social self-esteem: 8/10

The individual is proactive in advocating for their ideas and goals, which suggests a moderate level of social self-esteem - they are confident enough to stand up for what they believe but not necessarily overconfident or seeking constant validation from others. 

Organization: 6/10  

The situation about making the prosthetic arm shows that organization skills are present when dealing with complex projects needing detailed attention, however, this doesn't provide a comprehensive picture of organizational skills across all contexts as some details could be missing.

This assessment suggests that while there are clear strengths in Diligence and Prudence, certain aspects such as Social Boldness and Liveliness may require further development for balance.
