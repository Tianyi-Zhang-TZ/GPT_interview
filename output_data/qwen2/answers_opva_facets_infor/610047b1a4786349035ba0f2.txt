Diligence: 4 

The answer demonstrates a good level of diligence, particularly in the first example where the individual decided to attend an after-work social event and mingle with others despite being timid. This shows initiative and effort towards networking and learning from interactions with different roles within the company.

Perfectionism: 3  

While the ice cream serving experience shows the ability to handle multitasking and mental math, it does not specifically relate to a situation that required paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes at work. The answer focuses more on managing multiple tasks efficiently rather than perfectionism.

Prudence: 4 

The individual's willingness to step up as supervisor when needed shows prudence, as they took advantage of an opportunity to advance their position and demonstrated responsibility and calculated risk-taking.

Social boldness: 3  

In attending the after-work social event despite initial timidity, the individual showed some level of social boldness by stepping out of their comfort zone for professional networking. However, this does not fully demonstrate a consistently bold approach in all social situations.

Liveliness: 2 

The answer lacks clear examples that highlight liveliness or enthusiasm during work-related tasks and interactions. While the ice cream serving example mentions excitement over solving problems, it is not elaborated on as a consistent trait across different scenarios.

Sociability: 3  

There are hints of sociability when attending an after-work event to interact with people from other departments. However, this does not fully demonstrate ongoing engagement in social activities or proactive networking behavior.

Social self-esteem: 2 

The answer does not provide strong evidence for high levels of social self-esteem, which would include a confident and positive approach towards professional interactions and the ability to take initiative in social settings.

Organization: 3  

The examples provided do not offer clear insights into organizational skills. However, being able to manage multiple tasks simultaneously while serving ice cream suggests some level of organizational capability.
