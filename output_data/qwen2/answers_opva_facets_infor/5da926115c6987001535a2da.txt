The person scores highly in Diligence and Organization due to their proactive attitude towards challenging tasks, willingness to work beyond what is required of them, and their meticulous approach towards equipment cleanliness and reassembly at the workplace. However, they have a moderate score in Perfectionism as they admit there might be some mistakes when handling delicate tasks like champagne flutes.

The person scores moderately on Social Boldness due to their wait-and-see attitude when leading group discussions but seems to take initiative and leadership roles when necessary. They exhibit moderate Sociability as they show willingness to attend social events, but not necessarily looking forward to them or feeling energized by them.

They score reasonably well in Social Self-Esteem as shown through their confidence in handling new situations and unfamiliar environments like a house party, showing some level of comfort with themselves even when not surrounded by familiar people. 

Prudence is moderately high due to the person's calculated approach towards advancing from being a part-time bartender to full-time, indicating careful thought rather than impulsive actions.

Liveliness scores are lower because while they were able to help improve kitchen morale and produce at top levels in some situations, there doesn't seem to be any evidence of spontaneous or energetic behavior that would indicate high liveliness.

Sociability is rated as moderate considering their participation in after-work social events and willingness to engage with others when required.
