Perfectionism: 3.5 

Although the individual mentions that they are meticulous with equipment at work and likes to see inspiration from external sources (like news) when dealing with tasks requiring attention to detail, this facet is not particularly emphasized strongly enough to warrant a full score on perfectionism.
