Their willingness to stay until an after-work social event suggests that they are dependable.

Perfectionism: 8/10 

While the individual seems meticulous in detail-oriented tasks, there's also a hint of perfectionism, which may lead them to be too strict and focused on details at times.

Prudence: 6/10

Social boldness: 7/10

Social self-esteem: 7/10 

While the individual appears confident and proactive about helping their team members when they're feeling down, there's no explicit mention of how this affects their personal sense of self-worth. This score assumes that the individual maintains a reasonable level of confidence in social situations based on their actions.

Organization: 6/10
