Diligence: 4.5 

The person in the answers shows a strong work ethic and willingness to push themselves beyond what is expected when faced with challenging tasks (Question 4). They describe being very ambitious, motivated by external pressures or goals (like wanting to impress their employer), demonstrating diligence.

Perfectionism: 3.0

While they mention that mistakes would have led them to redo work multiple times (Question 6), there's no explicit emphasis on the need for perfection throughout all interactions. There are instances where they seem more willing to let others take responsibility or manage themselves (Question 7).

Prudence: 4.0 

The individual consistently avoids acting impulsively and instead prefers straightforward dedication and hard work, even in situations where an opportunity might have been available through manipulation or backhanded deals (Question 8). They value traditional methods over potentially risky shortcuts.

Social boldness: 2.0 

The person seems to prefer solitary activities and finds socializing awkward or distasteful (Questions 5,7). Their reluctance to engage in after-work social events or their general discomfort with interacting socially at work suggest they may not be very outgoing or assertive in social settings.

Liveliness: 3.0

They seem capable of boosting spirits when necessary (Question 7), which suggests some level of liveliness and ability to motivate others in a professional setting. However, this is only demonstrated once and doesn't reflect a consistent characteristic across all situations.

The person values their output and abilities but also seems to prioritize maintaining independence and avoiding workplace politics over fostering relationships or relying too heavily on external validation (Questions 7,8).

Organization: 4.0
