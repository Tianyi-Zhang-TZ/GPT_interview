Explanation:

1. Diligence: The answer reflects a strong work ethic and dedication to professionalism, which aligns well with the facet of diligence.

2. Perfectionism: Although not mentioned specifically in the answers, given how the individual discusses being cautious about making mistakes and preferring to do tasks efficiently over dedicating excessive time to them, this suggests they are somewhat perfectionistic. However, perfectionism can also involve a desire for efficiency and effectiveness, which is reflected positively here.

3. Prudence: The individual displays prudence in several aspects of their answers. They make strategic decisions based on careful consideration (as seen with the after-work social event) and exhibit thoughtful planning when pursuing personal goals at work.

4. Social boldness: This facet seems to receive a lower rating due to the emphasis on maintaining professional boundaries between work friends and personal life, as well as the preference for focusing solely on work during working hours rather than intertwining it with social activities.

5. Liveliness: The answer indicates that the individual is able to cheer up others who are feeling down through humor and distraction techniques, which aligns positively with liveliness.

6. Sociability: This facet receives a moderate rating as the person acknowledges their ability to attend after-work events but seems more focused on maintaining professional boundaries rather than seeking out or prioritizing social interactions during work hours.

7. Social self-esteem: The answer suggests that while the individual is willing to help others in need, they are not necessarily overly concerned with projecting themselves in a positive light through these actions.

8. Organization: Based on their ability to manage tasks requiring attention to detail and planning strategies for obtaining personal goals, this facet receives a high rating, indicating effective organization skills.

Overall, the individual exhibits a strong work ethic and professionalism (Diligence and Prudence), while showing some level of conscientiousness towards maintaining boundaries with social interactions at work (Social boldness). Their liveliness helps in uplifting colleagues, but they prefer to keep their personal and professional lives separate. Their organization skills are high, which supports efficient task completion and planning for future goals.
