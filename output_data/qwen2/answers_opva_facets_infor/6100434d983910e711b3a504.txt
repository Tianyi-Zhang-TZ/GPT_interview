Diligence: 5/5

This facet refers to the willingness to work hard and consistently strive towards goals. The provided answers demonstrate a strong commitment to diligent behavior in both scenarios. In the first situation, the individual acknowledges team members' feelings, seeks understanding, and works on finding solutions rather than avoiding issues or dismissing concerns superficially. This approach involves identifying problems, discussing them openly, and working together to resolve them. Similarly, in the second scenario regarding raises at work, they prepare evidence of their accomplishments before approaching their boss for a discussion, which is another manifestation of diligence.

Perfectionism: 4/5

The first answer shows signs of perfectionism as the individual focuses on communication being crucial for maintaining morale and team spirit. While this approach aims to build up the team's spirits effectively, it may occasionally lead to an obsession with finding precise solutions rather than just addressing issues, which might be a hallmark of perfectionism.

Prudence: 5/5

The second answer demonstrates prudence through careful consideration before acting on impulses or making decisions about raises. The individual prefers to show their worth through consistent work and evidence gathering instead of merely demanding what they believe is owed to them without effort.

Social boldness: 3/5

Social boldness refers to the willingness to take risks in social situations. The first situation reveals a somewhat cautious approach as the person acknowledges feelings but avoids dismissing or shaming others about their concerns; they seek understanding and solutions together with the team members. In contrast, the second scenario exhibits a more assertive personality as the individual confidently presents evidence of their work and achievements to justify their desire for a raise.
