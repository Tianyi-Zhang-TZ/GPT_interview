Diligence: 4.0

The individual described in the answers shows a high level of diligence, as evidenced by their willingness to take on challenging tasks even when it pushes their limits and the need to focus heavily to avoid making mistakes due to perfectionism.

Perfectionism: 3.5 

While not excessively obsessed with perfection, there is evident attention to detail required to avoid errors at work. This implies a moderate level of perfectionism that contributes positively to job performance but could also potentially lead to unnecessary stress if overemphasized.

Prudence: 4.0

The individual demonstrates prudence by avoiding actions that might be considered risky or against the company's rules, such as staying longer than allowed during breaks without permission and not engaging in behavior that could lead to confrontations.

Social boldness: 2.5 

The answers indicate that the individual tends to be introverted and may struggle with social interactions at work unless they force themselves out of their comfort zone. Their responses suggest a moderate level of social boldness, which might limit their ability to connect with colleagues effectively in some situations.

Liveliness: 3.0

There's evidence suggesting that the individual can boost their own spirits during times when team members are feeling down, although they acknowledge this is primarily done for their personal morale and not as an active attempt to lift others' spirits.

Sociability: 2.5 

The individual seems to lack a strong social presence at work, preferring solitary activities over communal ones unless invited or there's free food involved. This might impact the development of relationships with colleagues.

Social self-esteem: 3.0

While not explicitly addressed in their responses, there are some signs that suggest the person has varying levels of confidence based on different situations and circumstances. For example, they can force themselves into social situations to some extent but seem hesitant when it comes to spontaneous after-work events.

Organization: 4.0 

The individual demonstrates an organized approach to their work tasks, paying attention to details as required by certain jobs (like being a cashier), which reflects highly on their organizational skills and ability to manage tasks efficiently.

In summary, the person has traits of diligence, prudence, and organization but needs improvement in areas such as social boldness and liveliness. The individual shows moderate levels of perfectionism, sociability, and social self-esteem, while being able to handle challenging situations with a reasonable level of confidence.
