Diligence: 4/5

In the described scenarios, it's evident that you're diligent when necessary. This is particularly clear in your experiences at different work environments where tasks require attention to detail or involve helping others without hesitation.

Perfectionism: 3/5

Your perfectionism seems to be situational rather than an overarching trait. In specific situations like managing rent counts, you were pressured and took extra effort to ensure accuracy. However, the scenario involving buying drinks for team members doesn't seem to imply perfectionism but more of a proactive gesture.

Prudence: 4/5

You're quite prudent in many ways, especially considering your actions at work environments. You weigh the situation before acting impulsively and consider the impact on others (e.g., counting rent accurately without stepping on coworkers' toes), showing prudence and thoughtful decision-making.

Social boldness: 3/5

Social boldness isn't a prominent trait based on these situations, as you seem more inclined to follow the flow of situations rather than initiating them. However, you are willing to help others when necessary or when it aligns with your personal values.

Liveliness: 2/5

While liveliness seems to be evident in choosing to buy drinks for colleagues or acting on impulse to wait tables for a good tipper, this aspect isn't consistently portrayed across the different scenarios. Liveliness might play a role occasionally but doesn't define you in every situation.

Sociability: 3/5

You are sociable when it's necessary for tasks like managing rent counts and making others feel better (buying drinks). However, you seem to be more reserved or selective about being social based on the situations rather than an overarching trait of extroversion.

Social self-esteem: 4/5

Your social self-esteem seems relatively stable across these scenarios. You don't seek out confrontation but are firm when required and care deeply about helping others without compromising your personal values.

Organization: 3/5

Organization plays a role in tasks that require attention to detail, like counting rent days or managing tasks efficiently (waiting tables for good tips). However, organization might not always be a core trait based on these descriptions; you're more proactive when necessary rather than being naturally organized.
