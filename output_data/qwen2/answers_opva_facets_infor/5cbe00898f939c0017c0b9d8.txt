Diligence: 5/5

The individual demonstrated a strong work ethic by volunteering to deal with the snake in the bananas and even staying late at work, coming in early, cleaning beyond their duties, and doing inventory when not required, showing they were willing to put in extra effort.

Perfectionism: 4/5

In one instance, the individual's attention to detail was crucial in correctly understanding instructions on a test. This shows their insistence on thoroughness but fell short as the teacher was a comedian who didn't intend for such strict adherence to the instructions.

Prudence: 3/5 

The individual acted prudently by considering the long-term benefits of getting a position they desired, even going beyond their duties to ensure eventual success. However, this trait wasn't as prominent when dealing with coworkers, suggesting that they might act impulsively in social situations without always weighing the consequences.

Social boldness: 2/5

While the individual seemed to enjoy being around colleagues and considered it part of work culture, there was a lack of bold initiative or assertiveness. For example, they didn't stand up for themselves against others who were drinking excessively after work.

Liveliness: 1/5 

In situations requiring energy and enthusiasm like social events post-work, the individual seemed to enjoy them but did not exhibit liveliness in organizing activities or leading events.

Sociability: 4/5

The individual was comfortable interacting with colleagues outside of formal work duties, enjoying after-work get-togethers. This suggests a healthy balance between professional and personal relationships at work.

Social self-esteem: 3/5 

Though the individual seemed to enjoy socializing with colleagues, there wasn't much evidence suggesting they actively sought out leadership roles or initiated new activities in social settings.

Organization: 2/5

The individual's organizational skills were evident when they needed them for success (like preparing for a test) but lacked in other areas where they didn't have clear tasks to follow, showing that organization might not be their strongest facet.
