Based on the provided answers, here's a rough estimation of the person's personality according to the HEXACO model:

Diligence: 3.0

The individual seems willing to push themselves in challenging situations and acknowledges potential problems they could face. However, there are also indications of procrastination ("I will" but then "I don't know") which might suggest a lack of consistent follow-through.

Perfectionism: 2.5  

There's a sense of attention to detail and some reluctance to make mistakes ("before everything before something is cleared"), suggesting a moderate level of perfectionism. However, this trait isn't highly developed based on the provided answers.

Prudence: 3.0

The person seems thoughtful about their actions and seems willing to consider others' feelings when making decisions like raising spirits in a down team situation ("I tried to raise the Spirits"). There's also some level of self-awareness regarding potential miscommunications or mistakes ("Of course, I put it in a nice way").

Social boldness: 2.0

The individual seems somewhat reserved and potentially uncomfortable in social settings they're unfamiliar with, as indicated by their response about feeling "best free" around people they don't know.

Liveliness: 3.5 

There's an element of liveliness shown through the individual's ability to find humor or motivation in challenging situations ("I tried to raise Spirits" and "it didn't see specific") and showing empathy towards colleagues' feelings.

Sociability: 2.5

The individual appears hesitant about after-work social events, indicating a moderate level of sociability that may be influenced by external factors like teamwork dynamics.

Social self-esteem: 3.0 

There's an element of confidence in certain situations ("I'm the best free") but also some awareness of personal limitations ("like this happened didn't happen to anyone as I'm a little old black person").

Organization: 4.0

The individual seems highly organized, with attention to detail and a proactive approach towards completing tasks efficiently.

Overall personality score based on these ratings would be around 3.3. This indicates a somewhat balanced personality that leans slightly more towards being conscientious (as shown in Diligence, Perfectionism, Prudence, Organization) but also has room for improvement in terms of social skills and self-esteem. It's important to note that this is an estimation based on a limited set of responses and actual assessments might vary depending on the individual's context and experiences not represented here.
