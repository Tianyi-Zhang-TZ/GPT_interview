While the individual shows dedication and effort towards improvement, there is a suggestion of pragmatism in not forcing outcomes through perfectionist tendencies (like insisting upon something).

This could limit their ability to directly influence others or advocate for themselves confidently.

Liveliness: 3/5

While the person does seem enthusiastic about their work environment, especially when it comes to being there for friends and colleagues, their liveliness is not overly exuberant or outwardly expressed.
