- Perfectionism scores moderate-high (3.5). The individual mentions attention to detail and finding flaws in tasks repeatedly, indicating perfectionistic tendencies but not to an extreme level.

- Prudence gets a low score (2.5) as there seems little indication of self-restraint or careful consideration before acting impulsively.

- Social boldness is rated as moderate (3.0). The answer indicates a strong presence and assertiveness in social settings, although the exact level of boldness is not fully clear.

- Liveliness receives a high score (4.0) based on positive interactions with others and ability to uplift spirits.

- Sociability scores low (2.0), as there appears to be reluctance or avoidance of after-work events.

- Social self-esteem gets a moderate-high score (4.5) because the individual is quite confident in social settings, even when unfamiliar with others.

- Organization receives a mid-range rating (3.5). There are mixed signals about organization skills¡ªon one hand, tasks seem to be completed and put back in order; on the other hand, there's mention of messiness at times.

Diligence stands out as particularly strong.
