Diligence: 4.0

The person mentions taking initiative to contact others with superior technical knowledge and asking them to guide the task when it was too challenging, which shows a tendency towards diligence as they push themselves harder rather than pass off tasks.

Perfectionism: 3.5  

The person mentions being detail-oriented but also states that if there isn't enough guidance on expectations for what needs to be completed, they might not proceed confidently with the task. This implies a moderate level of perfectionism, considering they seek instruction and may wait for things to work out rather than act impulsively.

Prudence: 4.0

The person describes thinking through situations carefully before taking actions that might not be beneficial in the long run, such as considering whether a new job opportunity is truly better than their current situation or waiting for opportunities that align better with their team's needs.

Social boldness: 2.5 

Although they contribute quite significantly to group sessions and may have been more engaged, they did not always lead them. This suggests a moderate level of social boldness; while they can be engaging and active participants, they are not usually the leader in discussions.

Liveliness: 3.0

The person acknowledges being emotionally sensitive and able to provide encouragement when needed but seems to prefer smaller group settings for doing so. They seem willing to lift spirits but might not have a high level of liveliness as they do not engage in after-work social events that would require more active participation.

Sociability: 3.0 

The person indicates having some separation between work and personal life, suggesting a moderate sociability score as their interactions with colleagues are professional and formal when necessary but not overly friendly outside of work hours due to a preference for maintaining boundaries.

Social self-esteem: 4.5  

They describe feeling uncomfortable in social settings where they don't know others and considering themselves somewhat timid in such situations. This indicates that they have relatively high social self-esteem, as their discomfort arises from the lack of familiarity rather than a fundamental lack of confidence in social interactions.

Organization: 3.0
