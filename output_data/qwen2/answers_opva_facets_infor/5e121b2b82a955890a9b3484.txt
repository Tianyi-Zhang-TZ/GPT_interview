Diligence: 9/10

Your dedication to tasks and your focus on detail indicate a high level of diligence. You're driven by a desire to get things perfect, which shows in your efforts to ensure every task is completed with meticulous care.

Perfectionism: 7/10

While your attention to detail and drive for excellence are admirable traits, perfectionism can sometimes lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety about minor mistakes like forgetting to label points on graphs. It's important to recognize that striving for perfection isn't always achievable or necessary, especially considering the value of learning from mistakes.

Prudence: 8/10

You exhibit prudence in certain situations by avoiding involvement in others' personal issues and respecting boundaries. However, there could be more room for empathy when coworkers are feeling down, as you seem to acknowledge that their feelings impact your productivity negatively.

Social boldness: 4/10

Your tendency to avoid getting personally involved in colleagues' problems suggests a lower level of social boldness. It's crucial to balance professionalism with supportiveness and understanding when interacting with others, especially during times of stress or unhappiness.

Liveliness: 5/10

While you seem capable of experiencing excitement about acquiring items like drapes that you really want, your tendency to get overly anxious about tasks might limit your ability to enjoy the present moment. Being mindful of the balance between anticipation and productivity could enhance your overall liveliness.

Sociability: 6/10

You appear to care for others but seem hesitant in offering direct support during their down times. This suggests a moderate level of sociability that could benefit from increased empathy and proactive assistance when coworkers are struggling with feelings or motivation.

Social self-esteem: 7/10

Your self-esteem seems robust enough to motivate your hard work, yet it's affected by the fear of repeating past mistakes like missing points on exams. It might be beneficial to reframe this anxiety into a drive for continuous improvement rather than a source of worry about failure.

Organization: 8/10

Your organizational skills seem strong as evidenced by your meticulous attention to detail and ability to manage tasks effectively within allocated time frames. This trait helps you maintain productivity, although perfectionism might sometimes hinder efficiency if you find yourself spending excessive time on minor details.

In summary, your diligence is a strong point that drives your work ethic, while perfectionism adds depth but may need moderation for better mental health management. Social boldness could be improved by being more supportive of colleagues' emotional needs, and liveliness can be enhanced through acknowledging and managing excitement in a balanced manner rather than letting it lead to excessive stress or anxiety.
